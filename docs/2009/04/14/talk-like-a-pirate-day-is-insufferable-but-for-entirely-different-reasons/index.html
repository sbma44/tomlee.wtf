                <p>Rob Pegoraro, the Post's technology columnist, <a class="reference external" href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/fasterforward/2009/04/who_are_you_calling_a_software.html">is looking for alternative names for software theft</a> that aren't associated with, ahem, maritime terrorism:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">The NYT's always-interesting Freakonomics blog <a class="reference external" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/04/13/is-it-time-to-rename-digital-piracy/">raised that question</a> yesterday. Stephen J. Dubner wrote that &quot;as real-life pirate attacks have gained in intensity, violence, and geopolitical meaning, talking about digital thieves as pirates has come to seem clever to a fault, and inaccurate too.&quot;</div>
<div class="line">The Business Software Alliance, a trade group devoted to stopping people from using commercial software without paying for it first, does not agree. Also yesterday, the CNet tech-news site reported that a BSA publicist sent an e-mail explicitly comparing thugs hijacking supertankers to software thieves: &quot;Piracy takes many forms, some more violent than others.&quot;</div>
<div class="line">(Writer Gordon Haff called that e-mail &quot;one of the most tone-deaf and cynically opportunistic PR pitches I've seen for quite some time.&quot;)</div>
<div class="line">[...]</div>
<div class="line">Blogger John Gruber suggests the term &quot;bootlegging,&quot; but I'm not sure about that noun either. To me (a one-time concert reviewer for the Post), it evokes homemade recordings from concerts, an activity that demands individual initiative and, when done right, creativity. Installing a copy of a program on two computers doesn't require much of those qualities.</div>
<div class="line">&quot;Software theft&quot; itself suffers the problem that theft, by definition, involves the victims losing the stolen property [...] That doesn't happen with digital media, where somebody installing a not-paid-for copy of Office doesn't stop your copy, mine or Steve Ballmer's from working. Rather, the key concept here is that somebody has short-circuited a normal business transaction through deceit or trickery. And for that, the most apt definition appears to be &quot;fraud&quot;</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Fraud is not a good term for this, as the software consumer is not misrepresenting his or herself, and in fact generally has no interaction at all with the software vendor. &quot;Fraud&quot; implies that the victimized party has been manipulated into surrendering something of value under false pretenses. That doesn't really apply to these cases.</p>
<p>Gruber's suggestion of &quot;bootleggers&quot; is better than &quot;fraud&quot;, but it's unfortunately normative in that most people now consider Prohibition (which is what most people think of when they hear &quot;bootlegging&quot;) to have been an unreasonable imposition by the government — as a result, in this case the terminology would imply that software appropriation is legitimate.</p>
<p>A better description would be &quot;freeloaders&quot;, as users of unlicensed proprietary software are extracting value from a system without supporting it themselves. It also has a pun in it, since they're &quot;loading&quot; the software on their machines! Obviously this should count as a major strike against it.</p>
<p>Even though I couldn't resist leaving in an irrelevant quote beating up on them, in the end I have to side with the BSA. Not because &quot;piracy&quot; is a great term for software theft — it's manipulative and inaccurate — but because <em>that's what we have been and will continue to call it</em>.</p>
<p>I don't mean to just rail against the evolution of language in a reflexive, let's-bitch-about-political-correctness sort of way. But the fact that some people are suddenly feeling guilty for previously having a whimsical attitude toward all things piratical strikes me as pretty silly. Surprise: there are a lot of idioms with horrific literal meanings that we regularly deploy lightheartedly — &quot;highway robbery&quot;, &quot;scared to death&quot;, &quot;thrown under the bus&quot; — these would all be unpleasant things to experience! Tragedy + time = comedy and all that. Enjoying the amusing caricature of piracy that we've developed over the last several decades is not the same thing as dismissing the horrors of real-life piracy.</p>
<p>Now: who wants to play some Halo 3 tonight? I promise to feel at least little bad when I use the sniper rifle.</p>
