                <p>Well, I remain sick and miserable. Eleven or twelve hours' worth of sleep didn't do much to improve things (although I am at least a little less confused), but my body is still a distinctly unpleasant place to be. I've had enough — it's time to find a doctor and get some goddamn antibiotics. I've been a very good boy when it comes to not demanding superbug-breeding pharmaceuticals for minor illnesses, but this is too much. I'm calling in whatever credit I've built up.</p>
<p>The only problem is that I don't really have a doctor, per se. I put down a primary care physician for insurance purposes when I changed jobs, but I haven't actually been to see her. Some phone calls revealed that not only is she not open on weekends, but she's changed practices. That's a no-go.</p>
<p>And then there was the pleasantly confused old man I visited a few years back, who accidentally wrote me multiple prescriptions for what I have since been assured is an alarmingly powerful antibiotic. It would have been a promising route to pursue, but I don't remember his name and kind of doubt he'd take weekend appointments and/or still be alive.</p>
<p>So it was off to the Blue Cross website to find a nearby doctor. And I think I hit paydirt on the first search result. No fancy-pants weekend answering services for Dr. Akhigbe: judging by how confused he was at getting my call, I'm pretty sure I'd gotten him on his cell phone. I guess that's the sort of high-touch approach they teach at the University of Lagos.</p>
<p>Anyway, after the initial confusion and alarm at receiving my call had subsided, the doctor was extremely pleasant and helpful. &quot;I don't think I'll be in the office this morning, but I might be there in the afternoon,&quot; he said in a pronounced Nigerian accent. &quot;Why don't you try around three?&quot;</p>
<p>Why not indeed. So three it is, and I've got high hopes for cajoling some antibiotics out of him. Not only do my symptoms seem to actually be appropriate to a bacterial infection (it's like having a normal sore throat, except much less pleasant), but Dr. Akhigbe is, in addition to being a general practitioner, a pain specialist. Odds of me walking out of that office with a scrip for oxycontin just got ugraded from &quot;poor&quot; to &quot;fair&quot;.</p>
