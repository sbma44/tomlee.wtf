                <p>Man, what a lousy start to the morning. To be fair, any morning that starts at 2:30 is probably going to be fairly crappy, but this one has some real staying power. I was awakened by a tap-tap-tapping on my chamber door. The last time this happened it was a cop who wanted to explain that he'd chased a suspect into my garage. Based on that experience it seemed like it was worth getting up. This time it was just my neighbor, who swept into the apartment and started fiddling with our thermostat. Apparently something in the building was vibrating annoyingly, and, as irresponsible young renters, Charles and I seemed like the sort of people who might ignore a problem until it involved shrapnel and scalding.</p>
<p>But it turned out that it wasn't our furnace at all — it was blowing its usual stream of frigid air throughout the nighttime apartment as reliably as ever. This happens every time it snows — the heat pump can't produce air hot enough to meet our modest-yet-optimistic thermostat setting, so the system just tries blowing the cold air <em>faster</em> in order to make up the difference. I appreciate the effort, but it's not much help.</p>
<p>The other annoyances have been more minor. There was the slog to work through unsalted sidewalks — well, except for the American Chemical Association's stretch of pavement, which is always immaculately clear (but also seems likely to be highly carcinogenic). And LastCall is <a class="reference external" href="http://www.dcist.com/archives/2007/02/14/lastcall_needs.php">throwing a fit</a>, requiring me to shut it down until I can locate a nasty bug and quash it.</p>
<p>But the biggest letdown is that our company sexual harassment training — which, yes, was scheduled for Valentine's Day — has been rescheduled due to the winter weather. I'm pretty bummed out; I had gone to a lot of effort separating candy hearts into &quot;workplace-safe&quot; and &quot;unacceptably sexual&quot; piles.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/390331941/"><img alt="valentine's candy hearts sorted into 'acceptable' and 'unacceptable' piles" class="center" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/157/390331941_9bd013673c.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: 375px;" /></a></div>

<p>Some of these were judgment calls: &quot;my boy&quot; was on the line, but its assertion of possession (and racist undertones) ultimately led me to give it the axe. Similarly, &quot;dare ya&quot; seemed fairly non-sexual, but was discarded due to the high odds that it would set events in motion that could lead to worker's comp claims. But most of the objectionable hearts were easy to spot. &quot;Kiss me&quot;? &quot;So fine&quot;? You'd be astounded at the filth that Brach's gets away with.</p>
<p>As for the rest of the day... well, I'm not optimistic. The high availability of candy hearts in my workplace makes it likely that I'm going to be feeling very sick by the time I head home.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> The stupid cafe around the corner forgot to put stupid dolmadas in my stupid carryout Greek salad. I hate this universe.</p>
