            <div class="entry-content" data-pagefind-body>
                <p>The Post's got <a class="reference external" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/11/AR2007091102087.html">a story</a> that might be of interest to my fellow UVA alums: apparently one of the school paper's idiot cartoonists has gotten himself fired over an offensive cartoon. It took some hunting, but I managed to find the cartoon in question, which comes from a comic strip called <em>Quirksmith</em>:</p>
<p><img alt="Quirksmith Ethiopian Food Fight Cartoon" class="center" src="/static/2007/09/12/quirksmith_ethiopian_food_fight.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 133px;" /></p>
<p>As you might expect, the most notable thing about the comic is its overwhelming lack of funniness. The joke's confused in a way that's difficult to explain — rather than being smartly flipped to hilarious effect, the conceptual setup simply lolls off to the side, like the top layer slumping off of an <a class="reference external" href="http://pygmalioninablanket.blogspot.com/2007/09/all-we-do-is-cakes.html">overengineered cake</a>.</p>
<p>It's also not very offensive, I don't think (said the white, middle-class, first-world blogger). The figures have a primitive look, but not one that's easy to unequivocally define as racist (Thinking about this more, I've changed my mind — obviously implying that all Ethiopians live in primitive conditions is pretty racist; my initial scan was for physical caricature, which isn't present. But the Post article quotes the aggrieved parties as complaining about the famine-related sentiment rather than the pictoral representation, so I think it's safe to press onward regardless...). Maybe I'm being overly and/or insufficiently generous, but I doubt the cartoonist is even aware that there's currently a famine (or near-famine) occurring in Ethiopia.</p>
<p>The Post article points out that the guy is 22 years old — that's close enough to my age that I bet he heard the same Ethiopia-targeting &quot;yo mama so skinny&quot;-style jokes that I did in elementary school. In this case Ethiopia is just being lazily used as a stand-in for the tragically un-pluralizable Nicole Richie.</p>
<p>But he must have arrived on the tail-end of this lame playground schtick, or perhaps heard it from an older sibling. So it's not entirely surprising that various similarly-aged student groups would see the strip as a mean-spirited non sequitur rather than merely a lame riff on a decades-old joke. Still, calling for the author's head over this is strikes me as playing into the hands of the David Horowitzes of the world.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I think the strip has been somewhat comedically redeemed by the controversy, if only because the Post writeup includes the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Robert Mankoff, cartoon editor for the New Yorker, which specializes in drawings that mock human foibles, looked at Woolard's cartoon after a reporter e-mailed it to him.</div>
<div class="line">...</div>
<div class="line">&quot;The New Yorker magazine would not have published it,&quot; Mankoff said.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Surprising, I know. You'd think it would be a shoo-in, given that it's both a) so inscrutable as to imply non-existent depth and b) not at all funny. Unfortunately it contains no French puns, so the magazine had to politely decline the submission.</p>
<p>Of course, none of the preceding should be taken as a defense of the <em>Quirksmith</em> author. Like nearly all Cav Daily cartoonists, he deserves the worst that the universe can come up with. This isn't the first time he's fed indefensible red meat to ideologues, either; apparently the following cartoon actually made it onto <em>The O'Reilly Factor</em>:</p>
<p><img alt="another stupid quirksmith cartoon" class="center" src="/static/2007/09/12/quirksmith060824.png" style="width: 500px; height: 165px;" /></p>
<p>Ugh.</p>
<p>I shouldn't end on a down note, though. I can't compete with Jon, who tells me that nearly-perfect <a class="reference external" href="http://pbfcomics.com">Perry Bible Fellowship</a> ran in the paper at Syracuse while he was in school. But the Cavalier Daily did have one or two good comics while I was an undergrad. My favorite was <em>Shallow Grave</em>, a bitterly funny strip drawn by a guy named <a class="reference external" href="http://polyn.com">Sean Polyn</a>, who happened to work in the same lab where I spent some time.</p>
<p>Sean's too busy being a neuroscientist to draw strips these days, but he's still got a <a class="reference external" href="http://polyn.com/strips.html">bunch of em online</a>. Here are a few of my favorites:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://polyn.com/struct/hitler.html">Hitler clones</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://polyn.com/strips/leapinliz.jpg">True tales of the Lunar Patrol!</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://polyn.com/strips/strip-4.html">Buried alive</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://polyn.com/struct/choke.html">Choke-cola</a> (I don't know why I like [STRIKEOUT:you] this but I do)</li>
</ul>
