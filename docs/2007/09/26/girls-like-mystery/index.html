                <p>I realize that many <a class="reference external" href="http://www.tvsquad.com/2007/09/24/six-creeps-id-rather-date-than-vh1s-mystery/">already have</a>, but I think we need to talk about Mystery. I only became aware of the guy recently, as he unexpectedly began appearing on various TV shows that play in the background of my usual late night routine (which usually consists of fervently trying to load ROMs onto something or other).</p>
<p>I guess that Mystery's gotten himself a publicist and is making the rounds. I realize that in my own small way I'm playing into his hands by writing this. But I can't help it. He's just so awful.</p>
<p>He's also the host of a reality show on VH1 that's devoted to teaching guys how to pick up girls. Mystery is a pick-up artist, you see — the world's greatest, apparently, although it seems difficult to find solid metrics about this sort of thing. He's tall and not bad looking, although his wardrobe makes it instantly obvious that at some point in the past Pam Anderson and Tommy Lee had a garage sale. He paints his fingernails black. He used to be a magician.</p>
<p>I have to confess that I've never seen his VH1 show. I also haven't read Neil Strauss's book <em>The Game</em>, in which I'm told Mystery plays a prominent role (as you all know, I refuse to read any books that aren't about wizards). I'm speaking from a position of blessed ignorance.</p>
<p>But I have visited <a class="reference external" href="http://www.venusianarts.com/sl/va/VenusianArts.aspx">Mystery's website</a>, which he runs with a guy called Matador. &quot;Wait a minute,&quot; you may be saying, &quot;I'm beginning to think that these guys aren't using their real names!&quot; Right you are, my sharp-witted reader! It seems that people in Mystery's line of work like to use pseudonyms — like bloggers, except with venereal disease instead of comment spam. For example, the coauthors of Mystery's book include Lovedrop, Style, Sinn, Wilder, and Toecutter (Style is Neil Strauss). My favorite is <a class="reference external" href="http://www.thundercatseductionlair.com/2007/09/mystery-and-gre.html">Thundercat</a>, who I found while googling in support of this post (bonus: he describes a Daily Show &quot;sketch&quot; as &quot;chick humor&quot;). Mystery was well-prepared for pseudonymity, having already <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_%28venusian_artist%29#Biography">legally inserted</a> an unnecessary &quot;Von&quot; into his name in his early twenties.</p>
<p>Back to the website. It's pretty sad. Not because there are 473 of 500 backstage passes available for the next seminar, or even because it's running on a Microsoft webserver. No, it's the testimonial video. You really need to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcEo_HTKGFA">see it for yourself</a>, but for those unable to watch at work, allow me to summarize.</p>
<p>Three former students of Matador recount their experience at the &quot;backstage&quot; portion of a seminar. It's instantly clear how these men have been instructed to make their appearance more appealing to the opposite sex.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line"><img alt="some poor sucker" class="center" src="/static/2007/09/26/mystery_1.jpg" style="width: 422px; height: 317px;" /></div>
</div>
<p>&quot;You! The paunchy guy! Bleach some of your hair! Think 'guy who runs the sound board at a Fallout Boy show' — that's what we're going for.&quot;</p>
<p><img alt="image1" class="center" src="/static/2007/09/26/mystery_2.jpg" style="width: 422px; height: 317px;" /></p>
<p>&quot;You! Yes, the gentleman who looks unnervingly like the older brother of Tom's friends Jon and Mark. Your look will be 'the neck'. Girls love necks — they practically insist on them! You want to direct as much attention as possible to the area between your clavicles. Go!&quot;</p>
<p><img alt="image2" class="center" src="/static/2007/09/26/mystery_3.jpg" style="width: 422px; height: 317px;" /></p>
<p>&quot;As for you... well, uh. Hmm. How about you just try to appear in silhouette as much as possible? That might work, right?&quot;</p>
<p>Just listen to these poor dopes talk about the experience. It's all about how great Matador was at performing &quot;sets&quot; and &quot;going caveman&quot;. Yes, it sounds like Matador is awfully good at adhering to the principles of the system he invented to describe the things that he does. Similarly, I'm currently in the twenty-seventh year of a record-defying game of TomBall.</p>
<p>None of the gentlemen pictured above mention the girls that they've gotten as a result of paying $4000 to cretins. That, they presumably presume, will come later. It's a bad presumption, though (theirs, not mine — my presumption is fine). For one thing, these seminars seem likely to attract the least-promising students available. It's like those real estate seminars you see advertised late at night on channels that required the use of the second, clickier TV knob back when you where a kid. While it's true that some people make a lot of money at real estate speculation, it's also true that paying someone thousands of dollars to tell you that you should staple some signs to utility poles is not an effective way to gain admission to the plutocracy.</p>
<p>But the bigger problem is the lack of focus. For a bunch of guys desperate to improve their luck with the ladies, these three sure seem to have hard-ons for their greasy instructor. It's understandable: talking to strangers while wearing strange new clothes is hard. It would be much easier if you were less insecure — and surely someone who's enough of a jackass to call himself &quot;Matador&quot; must be comfortable in his own artificially-tanned skin. The goal gets shifted: before they know it they're simply trying to continue hanging out with a more dominant male, and paying to do so.</p>
<p>It's all right there on the website. Just check out Mystery's personal guarantee:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">&quot;If you are at all dissatisfied with my Training program, after you have fully attended all three days, I insist that you approach me on Sunday night, after the training is over.</div>
<div class="line">&quot;You can do so discreetly; I will not embarrass or expose you in front of other students — remember, you're family now.</div>
<div class="line">&quot;Explain to me the nature of your concern, and I will personally see to it that it will be addressed by me or my staff, as quickly as humanly possible.</div>
<div class="line">&quot;Should I still be unable to provide the value that you expect from me, I will gladly and promptly refund your attendance fees, including the (normally non-refundable) deposit.</div>
<div class="line">&quot;And guess what? We'll still stay friends. That's my commitment to you.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Hear that? Mystery — the man who's in the business of inventing ways to bypass women's agency and capacity for critical thought, reducing them to consumable objects to power his reality shows and ejaculations — respects and admires <em>you</em> as an individual. So much so, in fact, that the deep friendship forged by your commercial interaction trumps his desire to charge $4k to the Mastercard you applied for outside the campus dining hall. Even though he could buy a pretty sweet fuzzy hat with that money (and he could really use a new fuzzy hat). No, it's more important that the two of you stay friends. And seriously, as soon as his schedule frees up he'll swing by your folks' basement for that game of Halo you've been talking about. He hasn't played before, but he bets you're really good!</p>
<p>I know this, because it happened to me. During my freshman year of college I lived in a dorm suite that had a doorbell made from scrounged parts before the sun set on our first collegiate day. By the end of the semester it would also house an animatronic Tigger doll. I liked my suitemates a lot, and we all got pretty good at Starcraft. But there was no denying that the devout Christian guy was the second-coolest person among us.</p>
<p>But the first-coolest was Dave. Dave was friendly, short, and very successful with women. I hung out with Dave, and superficially tried to figure out how <em>I</em> could become the one to pull the fire alarm in the middle of the night to get my roommate out of the room, allowing me to lock the door behind myself and a coed. But soon I just mostly just trying to hang out with Dave. He was charming and self-assured, and having that all the time seemed even better than having drunken sexual encounters some of the time. But it didn't make me any more charming, or get me any more girls.</p>
<p>Ugh. I have to admit, though, that I'm kind of fascinated by this awful, awful scene. Much like when Kriston regaled the Jagermeister promotional team with the true, sordid origin of their employer's wares, I think it would be pretty fun to catch it <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seduction_community#Approaching_and_opening">in action</a> and have a chat with them about it. To McFadden's!</p>
