<div class="line">Wow. The past seven days have been pretty hectic — so much so that I'm a little shocked to see that it's been a week since I posted something here. Weird. Even more troubling, I haven't even been able to play with my <a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/44137303&#64;N00/286872273">new toy</a> (I'm referring to the microcontroller).</div>
<div class="line">Well, hopefully it'll calm down a bit. Election day is a good, decisive marking point. My subconscious thinks so, anyway: I've been having election dreams.</div>
<div class="line">It's pretty unusual for me. I don't dream very often — not in a way that's coherent enough to remember, at least. But these were vivid and occurred in quicker succession than I'm used to.</div>
<div class="line">The first one involved the deaths of both <a class="reference external" href="http://dccharles.blogspot.com">Charles</a>' mom and <a class="reference external" href="http://cruelsommer.blogspot.com">Sommer</a>. Although tragic, details remain fuzzy about the fate of the former. But I can say with confidence that Sommer died in a horrific rocket attack (delivered via helicopter) on a George Allen rally. What was she doing there? I'll leave it to Sommer to explain herself.</div>
<div class="line">The second dream was a bit weirder. I was in an airport departure lounge, getting ready to be shipped off to Iraq with a number of friends, Starship-Troopers-style. Only we weren't going to fight enormous insectoid aliens, or even Iraqis. Instead we were being sent as media grunts, drafted against our will to report fluff pieces with a pro-America spin. More specifically, we were all divvied up to produce television segments on the different member nations in the so-called <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinational_force_in_Iraq#List_of_nations_in_the_Coalition">Coalition of the Willing</a>. I got <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eritrea">Eritrea</a>, which is not actually a part of the aforementioned coalition. I was understandably worried about finding an angle for my reports.</div>
<div class="line">Both dreams were weirdly affecting. I woke up from the first one despairing, genuinely unsure of whether the narrative's victims were alive or not. I woke up from the second one furious (although this was admittedly more because of some frustrating in-dream boarding pass problems I'd had with security than because I was being forced to sugarcoat a monstrously immoral war — that part was dandy).</div>
<div class="line">Now, I'm no expert at dream interpretation. It's possible that my subconscious is actually more preocuppied with helicopters and TV news than with the election. But having <em>any</em> sort of political backdrop to my unwaking escapades is pretty weird, particularly given their rarity.</div>
<div class="line">So, for what little it's worth: I suspect we'll only get four seats in the senate. Because the universe is unjust, and it seems likely to me that at least one race will be swung by a last-minute helicopter attack.</div>
