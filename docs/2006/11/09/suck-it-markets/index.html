<div class="line">Atrios <a class="reference external" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/bRuz/~3/47154871/2006_11_05_atrios_archive.html">notes</a> that Tradesports completely failed to predict the outcome in the senate. In some ways, it's unfair to use control of the senate to criticize the idea of non-financial futures markets. In this case, we're talking about a very small range of possible outcomes and a situation that was genuinely hard to predict. All Tradesports said was that the Republicans were 70% likely to retain control. That probability has to collapse into reality at some point, and 30% is nothing to sneeze at. It just didn't work out this time.</div>
<div class="line">But I'm glad to crow about this failure, because I've been seeing more and more references to Tradesports on sites I read, and they're almost always unilluminating — or they're at least frustrating, since I have no idea who and how many participate in these markets. Apologies to my journalist friends — I realize that graphs from online futures markets are one of the greatest labor-saving devices to hit your profession since the invention of Lexis Nexis or Larry Sabato. But they're still sort of boring-slash-infuriating.</div>
<div class="line">As far as I can see, all that these markets get you is an honest effort on the part of their participants. Homerism and marketing within such systems become dramatically more expensive than such practices are elsewhere, which discourages dishonest behavior. That could certainly be useful when it comes to predicting sports outcomes or box office grosses or any number of other endeavors where prognosticators could have a motivation to deceive or insufficient motivation to carefully evaluate the problem.</div>
<div class="line">But when it comes to things like <a class="reference external" href="http://www.wired.com/news/politics/0,1283,59818,00.html">terrorism</a> or <a class="reference external" href="http://hurricanefutures.miami.edu/">hurricanes</a>, the futures market idea seems incoherent to me — unless you believe in its particular brand of magic (many open source enthusiasts are guilty of this, I should note, but they're no less wrong to do so). Experts in these rarified fields are presumably already doing their best to make objective predictions based upon all the data they can find: there are career-related mechanisms in place to encourage them to do so. Adding more voices and weighting them by cash on hand seems unlikely to be as useful as listening to and evaluating the justifications behind each voice's prediction.</div>
<div class="line">Basically, I don't see how you can divorce the qualifications of the contributor from the valuation placed upon his or her opinion. A desire to make money may be enough to qualify someone to predict how the Wizards are going to do, but I don't really see how it could help me figure out when a hurricane is going to make landfall.</div>
<div class="line">Admittedly, political outcomes seem more suited to the idea... but not in this case! So yeah: get bent, futures markets. Arguments make for more interesting reading than market graphs ever will.</div>
