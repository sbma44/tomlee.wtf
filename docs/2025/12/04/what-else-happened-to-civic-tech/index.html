                <p>Josh Tauberer has written <a class="reference external" href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-actually-happened-civic-tech-joshua-tauberer-ibnbe/?trackingId=FfDEvpzVMapzu0%2FrmSGBmg%3D%3D">a great and generous post reflecting on the civic tech era</a> and why its successes deserve to be celebrated, even if it has been some time since its heyday. I agree with him. I'm proud of my time at the Sunlight Foundation and the part that Sunlight played in shaping the larger movement's legacy. And, like with the open data and open source movements that preceded it, I am frustrated when others suggest a movement has failed simply because it has lost its grip on the zeigeist.</p>
<p>Like other movements, civic tech failed to acknowledge the depth of the legacy that came before, and failed to achieve the triumphs that its most optimistic boosters promised. But this is normal, maybe even inevitable. The ideas, people, and expectations that the effort created have persisted and spread, creating changes that are lasting and positive.</p>
<p>Still, saying I'm not disappointed is not the same as explaining what happened. I got to be in the middle of a singular moment and try out some exciting ideas. It was an enormous privilege. In the process I learned a lot about a lot of things. This definitely included lessons about how wrong some of my ideas were. I think it's worth reflecting on these a bit. Not to catalogue my ignorance, but because the vagaries of nonprofit self-promotion and funding can make it difficult to share these sad or embarrassing lessons in the moment when they're won. I doubt I understood them then, anyway!</p>
<div class="section" id="sunlight-was-early-and-weird">
<h2>Sunlight was early and weird</h2>
<p>I should acknowledge this up front. Although many others had done seminal work on open government data--Carl Malamud and Josh spring to mind as immediate antecedents, but of course there are many, many others--Sunlight was an early attractor of the kinds of big dollars that can create an institutional presence. This was thanks to our co-founders: Mike Klein, for his deep generosity and vision, and Ellen Miller for her charismatic genius at fundraising. That early bankroll annoyed a lot of people, whose priorities could be counted on to differ subtly from ours. That antagonism was perfectly understandable, and not helped by my own competitive streak.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="money-works-differently-than-we-thought">
<h2>Money works differently than we thought</h2>
<p>Our peer orgs having different priorities was in part a reflection of Sunlight's idiosyncratic pedigree: Ellen did important early money-in-politics work at the Center for Responsive Politics, crystallizing a post-Watergate understanding of political mendacity and influence. From their sometimes subtle methodological decisions, CRP shaped how generations of journalists taught the public to understand politics. Sunlight's reporting division embraced this perspective and did good work within it. And Sunlight writ large licensed and redistributed CRP's data and perspective.</p>
<p>But I struggled with the sense that this perspective was incomplete. It was discordant, for me at least, to learn that an aggregation of corporate dollars--what CRP would label as Pfizer's giving to a senator, say--did not necessarily reflect an act of singular corporate will (corporations can't make such donations in the US), but rather the sum total of individual people employed by that company who had bothered to record their employer accurately in the course of giving money. That's still a source of influence, of course. But audiences were often left to imagine a quid pro quo that couldn't be really be substantiated. There is a difference between a bribe and a constituency, but the distinction was rarely discussed. And problems compounded as comparative analysis was layered on top: your conclusions begin to feel threadbare when you realize how often &quot;occupation&quot; is missing from an FEC record, or begin to ponder what &quot;retired&quot;--the most common occupation--should be taken to signify.</p>
<p>At the same time, parallel processes existed, like corporate PACs, which seem straightforwardly implausible if you read the FEC rules under which they supposedly operate and induce the company's officers to fund them. Yet we had limited insight into those processes, or how lobbying--an entirely separate universe--worked.</p>
<p>We had been set up to find more Duke Cunninghams. Meanwhile, political scientists, led by John Sides, had used a combination of affable charm and donated intellectual firepower to successfully infiltrate the curiosity-gap media, transforming decades of papers into a furious couple years' worth of Wonkblog articles. They--and the friends of mine who were publishing them--confidently assured me that money in politics was meaningless. I was led to mutter inanities like &quot;consumption good&quot; and &quot;reifies relationships&quot; in a way that I should have known was embarrassing.</p>
<p>We didn't even understand how the dollars got used, or why. Are TV ads effective? Is door-knocking? Should we be looking at campaign mailers? Campaign expense reports? Political science has made progress on many of these questions, but is still intermittently roiled by them.</p>
<p>I never doubted that money mattered, but I also couldn't explain precisely <em>how</em> it mattered. And as my working explanation was refined, it became less and less plausible that it would ever be embraced by my colleagues, much less that it could be conveyed to the public in a satisfactory way.</p>
<p>This dissonance persisted through my entire time at Sunlight. I made hires to address it--some brilliant political scientists (recommended by Prof. Sides!) who even today teach me fascinating things from a distance and who, in the moment, led my team through a years-long cram session of opinionated but no less informative polisci literature. With their help, our team began to develop a more sophisticated and expansive understanding of political influence: one that included lobbying, rulemaking, and media.</p>
<p>The projects that flowed from this explored new territory: natural language processing of the Congressional Record; similarity analysis of regulations.gov dockets (this one seems to have helped me attract my wife). The list of Sunlight projects I am proud of is much, much longer than this, but most of them should be understood solely as reflections of the brilliance of my colleagues--my role was finding money and institutional support for them. The form the projects in these newer areas took was also always a reflection of my colleagues' brilliance, but I do take pride in having pointed them toward some greenfields. Political scientists started using our work to power their papers, instead of just the other way around. It felt good.</p>
<p>I think we got dramatically smarter, and I still believe you must understand a system before your efforts to improve it have much of a shot at succeeding. But the nuance we gleaned rarely made interventions more obvious. We continued to describe, educate, entertain, all while also trying not to wear out our welcome with readers, funders, and reporters who were looking for &quot;punchy&quot; and had to be talked into settling for &quot;smart&quot;. I remain grateful for Ellen and Mike's tremendous patience with this pursuit.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="transparency-works-differently-than-we-thought-too">
<h2>Transparency works differently than we thought, too</h2>
<p>Money in politics was just one side of the house, though. It was what Mike cared about. But our institutional funders were enthused for a fresher and less confrontational line of work: open government. Digital technology lends itself to openness--information wants to be free!--so this was an almost inevitable side-effect as we applied the new tools of the Web 2.0 era to old problems of disclosure. Sunlight hooked that piece of Tim O'Reilly marketing genius to our founders' interests in a clever way: openness would be in service of transparency. And transparency, according to our original formulation, would make government accountable and trusted. This is how you convince your boss, who wants to throw crooked pols in jail, that inveighing against the PDF file format is part of the same mission.</p>
<p>We kept the &quot;accountable&quot; part in the versions of the slogan that followed, but at some point anything incorporating &quot;trust&quot; had to be dropped. It became impossible to deny that transparency does not breed trust. It breeds questions. A skeptical audience will not be satisfied by the threads of information you hand them; they will grip them firmly and yank, and demand more when they don't find what they expected under the skein they've just ruined. They have been trained by our media environment to know that if they dig deep enough, they will unearth something rotten.</p>
<p>The public's insatiability doesn't make it okay to keep them in the dark. But, just as the YIMBY movement has had to grimly acknowledge that additional civic deliberation can become counterproductive, so too did I eventually admit to myself that transparency might need some kind of limiting principle.</p>
<p>To the extent that I conveyed this idea publicly, it was probably a mistake. I didn't take seriously enough the responsibilities that come with representing an organization: you are not being paid for nuance and candor, you are being paid to omit it! I didn't know how to do it well enough. I don't think I ever managed to talk my brilliant colleagues in our policy shop out of calling for cameras in the Supreme Court, though. So I doubt my misgivings did too much institutional damage.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="digital-democracy-works-differently-than-we-hoped">
<h2>Digital democracy works differently than we hoped</h2>
<p>The tools we were using could make information available to more people, and by doing so they could make participation feasible for people for whom it was currently impractical. We thought this was true, and I think we were right. Pursuing it as an end was axiomatically desirable for democracy and also practically aligned with our cohort's 20-to-30something lefty politics, in approximately the same ways that Rock the Vote was.</p>
<p>But how would this work in practice? Our model was cerebral. Citizens on the margin of participation would be newly empowered to read the online version of a bill, or infographics about a legislator's fundraising base, or a pleasantly formatted list of their earmark requests, and then make more educated decisions about how to express their wishes to their representatives and, eventually, cast their vote. We put endless reference material online. We wrung our hands over whether it needed an SMS interface to bridge the Digital Divide.</p>
<p>I still wish that internet-enabled political activation worked that way. Today, we know that the way to activate the marginally engaged voter is to make them mad and collect their information and/or money. Eventually, this powers ads and GOTV somewhere where it will matter for electing someone who, hopefully, wishes to advance the person's interests (though who can say whether the person would agree). It's done at massive and relentless scale.</p>
<p>I wish it were possible to make a web page so good that it inspired every harried single mom, demented retiree, resentful high school dropout, and disaffected teenager to enter a digital Athenian agora and take up their duty to participate in measured and productive debate with their fellow citizens. Alas!</p>
<p>In my defense, at the time lots of people thought the internet was going to work out in a different and better way. And we weren't <em>that</em> naive: we knew our tools didn't have universal appeal and designed them, in large part, for journalists, who we assumed would continue to exist. (Okay, maybe a little naive.)</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="we-had-to-learn-what-had-come-before">
<h2>We had to learn what had come before</h2>
<p>I mean, maybe we didn't have to. Eventually we did, though. &quot;Good government&quot; had a long history, and if we were young and brash we were at least also easily embarrassed. Long-suffering civil servants teetering on the brink of retirement were no doubt miffed when we spruced up the CSVs they'd struggled to bring online in past decades, cheerfully described their hard work as trash, and patted ourselves on the back for sticking it in a REST API. But they were also selfless enough to be glad the work was being used, and we tried to venerate their efforts appropriately whenever we came to understand them. Ultimately, many of our team members decided to follow in those civil servants' footsteps, which seems like about the best apology one could offer.</p>
<p>We learned why COBOL shouldn't be a punchline, excavated the interagency turf wars and obscure court rulings that shaped the gnarled data systems we sought. We started out dumb and cocky, but we learned, and I'm proud of us for it.</p>
<p>All this has come back to mind as I've watched the DOGE rampage. The same callow confidence that the problems are simple, your predecessors were pathetic, and your youthful brilliance is all that is (so desperately) needed. But vastly more recklessness, more callousness, more destruction. You can't expect young arrivistes not to be annoying and naive, but you can insist that they embrace humility, eventually, and that they accept the necessity of learning. Mostly, I think we did. But until we did, we often probably looked a bit silly.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="cui-bono">
<h2>Cui Bono</h2>
<p>Democratization was an ideal baked into all the work we did at Sunlight. A vision of massively expanded participation. But what would this mean? I'm embarrassed to admit to being surprised when it became clear that the most enthusiastic users of our Open States team's magisterial database of state legislative information were state-level lobbyists. Of course they would be!</p>
<p>I realized that I needed a more economically-minded theory of what we were doing. Engaging with government had costs, and we had shifted them. Perhaps that would admit more people at the margin--some NGOs, some retirees. A good outcome, something we had always said we wanted. But it would not exclude or make irrelevant the old guard. It might even save them money. And it would probably not lift up the voice of someone who was outside the system because of their lack of education, or time, or interest.</p>
<p>Beyond that, I began to lose some faith in the virtues of the plebiscite. Processing thousands of regulatory comments will do that! These came from people with a democratic right to be heard, sure. Many were excellent and productive. But when they arrived in mass--and attracted headlines--they were reliably from people who were uninformed and obviously being manipulated by self-interested organizations. And not even as an act of political organizing! Regulatory dockets are not ballots, and by law it is the substance, not the quantity, of the comments that counts. These advocacy organizations were funneling users into spamming dockets with carbon-copied comments as a cynical exercise in building their fundraising lists, whipping the public into a frenzy and giving them something pointless to do, keeping them ignorant of the fact that the meaningful part of their response to this call to action concluded the moment they coughed up their email address. That we found some of these organizations and causes personally sympathetic did not make this dynamic feel any less gross.</p>
<p>It's easy to recoil from this kind of thing and find ones' self in an unpleasantly patronizing or at least technocratic camp. I could feel myself doing it, and did my best to reject the tendency. &quot;Democracy is the worst system we've tried except all the others&quot;--that sort of thing. But a rejection of paternalism is a principle, not a strategy. You need something more specific when you spend your workdays shifting the old equilibrium in ways that you hope will be productive. I can't tell you what a relief it was to join a startup and find that all of this reflection could be replaced with a glance at a graph of monthly active users.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="politics-became-entertainment">
<h2>politics became entertainment</h2>
<p>Our work was designed to be engaging and attention-grabbing, and thanks to our comms team we were often pretty good at fulfilling that aim. But this unfolded during the rise of a new kind of political entertainment and cynical performative partisanship, typified by the Daily Show and its offspring and then by the narcissism of Twitter. Eitan Hersh aptly named it &quot;<a class="reference external" href="https://www.eitanhersh.com/uploads/7/9/7/5/7975685/hersh_theory_of_hobbyism_v2.0.pdf">political hobbyism</a>&quot;. This made some of the most fun things we did at Sunlight--notably including Breyten Ernsting's brilliant Politwoops project, which we had adopted at his request--steadily more worrisome. For me it became a question not just of impact, but identity.</p>
<p>I was born just outside of DC. My grandparents were foreign service officers. I grew up watching <em>The McLaughlin Grou</em>p and <em>Inside Washington</em> (&quot;daddy's boring shows&quot; may have been my most successful coinage prior to <em>Docket Wrench</em>). Policy, politics--this is the stuff my whole family would discuss at every gathering. On holidays, it was as reliably in the air as the smell of roast lamb and cream sherry.</p>
<p>I came back to DC after college and found myself drawn toward new friends who worked in political journalism, who obsessed about these topics endlessly and at a level of insight and insider knowledge I'd only dreamed of. I dated a brilliant political science student. I hired a different one.</p>
<p>It was with slowly dawning dismay that I realized my interest in politics might not be a signifier of sophistication. I wasn't special, just early (the same goes for my teenage addiction to BBSes). After countless redistillations and refinements in social media's fractionating column, it became undeniable that vanity, tribalism, and self-flattery were significant parts of why people found politics--and our work about it--interesting. Again: this is not a repudiation. Many people pursue politics as an avocation for immensely important reasons.</p>
<p>But I grew unsure that I was ever going to be one of them. And I doubted the wisdom of ushering more people like myself into the hobby, even if I was not ready to give it up. People deserve to be well-represented by our political system. But I slowly concluded that this representation must focus on their needs and rights before considering their solicited opinions--and that the internet's increasingly flattened and cacophonous embodiment of the latter was at serious risk of imperiling the former.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="sunlight-was-never-really-civic-tech">
<h2>Sunlight was never really civic tech</h2>
<p>Practitioners of more traditionally competitive forms of political work had resolved these kinds of qualms long ago. But building for a specifically partisan vision would not have interested me, and even if we'd somehow been able to legally do it, we would not have been able to assemble and motivate the uniquely talented people that Sunlight did. We knew many peers who were pursuing that kind of work: friends working for campaigns and consultancies, using the same technologies and sometimes even our code. It was a constructive division of labor. But our work was more abstract, driven by principles and a dose of idealism rather than the charismatic personalities and causes that inspired our campaign-worker friends. And while I don't mean to repudiate any of those principles, I have to admit that they worked differently than I thought they might.</p>
<p>If you abandon politics to the partisans, what's left is governance. That's what civic tech would become. I don't think Sunlight was ever completely cut out for it: there was a fun, gossipy cynicism lurking beneath our bright-eyed techno optimism, and an institutional refusal to ever stop obsessing about money, influence, and corruption.</p>
<p>It also felt <em>dreary</em>. Mind you, we prided ourselves on wading into eye-glazing bureaucratic minutiae. Our work on inscrutable spending databases is the reason why I detected an CFDA-related scam from someone pretending to be my mother-in-law on instagram just last month!</p>
<p>But I'd been a government contractor. I knew that the people talking about procurement reform were right, but also that it would inevitably involve criticizing set-asides for sympathetic groups; directly antagonizing wealthy corporations; and, most of all, an inevitable dissonance between our organizational commitment to anticorruption and the reality that past decades of similarly inspired good-government advocacy were probably a big part of the reason the situation had gotten so fucked up.</p>
<p>I was glad to see other people, like Waldo Jaquith, pick up the procurement reform torch. And I was glad to see Code for America's incredible success at adopting the mantle of civic tech, because they were not only very good at it, but willing to embrace the unglamorous but important details of service delivery. I'll admit it: I was almost as jealous about that as I was about their hoodies--not least of all because I knew that they had placed themselves where funder interest was straying.</p>

<h2>From civic tech to eternity</h2>
<p>Eventually, though, foundation officers' interest moved past even CfA. More could be said about that, but I will settle for expressing my gratitude for the generous support we received.</p>
<p>Enthusiasm for exposing political influence cooled. After <em>Citizens United</em>, the money in politics folks slowly admitted to themselves that they were no match for Mitch McConnell. The political scientists remained unable to find a statistical test that showed the things journalists knew to be true, but the matter was mooted once the journalists disappeared.</p>
<p>Jen Pahlka went on to government--and more recently, to life as a consequential public intellectual--and she was not the only one. 18f and USDS were full of Sunlight alums who had learned the same lessons I had and were ready to follow the movement's evolution into what may have always been its inevitable culmination: actually improving government.</p>
<p>They did. They are. And it should not be particularly surprising that you stopped hearing about their work. Doing things in government, while holding the incredible array of responsibilities that must come with the public's trust, is not glamorous. It's just hard and important.</p>
<p>I did not go with them. I left Sunlight after a five--six?--year run, and felt pretty good about it. I don't know enough about the period that followed to opine, but I was not shocked that Ellen proved irreplaceable, even as I was saddened by the consequences the organization's end had for many people I cared for and deeply respected.</p>
<p>We did our work in a rapidly changing world and, in retrospect, were a part of that process of transition, not a consequence of it. It can be hard to feel that kind of change in the moment. With so much to regret about the equilibrium the internet and society seem to have found, I can only hope the process is less complete than it seems.</p>
<p>But even though Sunlight's time has ended, I remain proud of how we rode the wave--at our best, with joy and curiosity and an eagerness to share. And I remain proud of the people and ideas it carried over the horizon and beyond easy sight.</p>
<p>Maybe this was a post more about me than about civic tech. Rereading Josh's post, I find I've restated much of it, just at much more tedious length! But I wanted to write it, because this time was important to me. I have tried very hard not to name any of the incredibly talented people that worked for and with me, because I am mortified by the idea of leaving anyone out. I hope they know how grateful I feel to have had the chance to count them as colleagues.</p>
