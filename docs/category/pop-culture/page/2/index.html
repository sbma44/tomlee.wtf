                    <p>Rob Pegoraro, the Post's technology columnist, <a class="reference external" href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/fasterforward/2009/04/who_are_you_calling_a_software.html">is looking for alternative names for software theft</a> that aren't associated with, ahem, maritime terrorism:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">The NYT's always-interesting Freakonomics blog <a class="reference external" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/04/13/is-it-time-to-rename-digital-piracy/">raised that question</a> yesterday. Stephen J. Dubner wrote that &quot;as real-life pirate attacks have gained in intensity, violence, and geopolitical meaning, talking about digital thieves as pirates has come to seem clever to a fault, and inaccurate too.&quot;</div>
<div class="line">The Business Software Alliance, a trade group devoted to stopping people from using commercial software without paying for it first, does not agree. Also yesterday, the CNet tech-news site reported that a BSA publicist sent an e-mail explicitly comparing thugs hijacking supertankers to software thieves: &quot;Piracy takes many forms, some more violent than others.&quot;</div>
<div class="line">(Writer Gordon Haff called that e-mail &quot;one of the most tone-deaf and cynically opportunistic PR pitches I've seen for quite some time.&quot;)</div>
<div class="line">[...]</div>
<div class="line">Blogger John Gruber suggests the term &quot;bootlegging,&quot; but I'm not sure about that noun either. To me (a one-time concert reviewer for the Post), it evokes homemade recordings from concerts, an activity that demands individual initiative and, when done right, creativity. Installing a copy of a program on two computers doesn't require much of those qualities.</div>
<div class="line">&quot;Software theft&quot; itself suffers the problem that theft, by definition, involves the victims losing the stolen property [...] That doesn't happen with digital media, where somebody installing a not-paid-for copy of Office doesn't stop your copy, mine or Steve Ballmer's from working. Rather, the key concept here is that somebody has short-circuited a normal business transaction through deceit or trickery. And for that, the most apt definition appears to be &quot;fraud&quot;</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Fraud is not a good term for this, as the software consumer is not misrepresenting his or herself, and in fact generally has no interaction at all with the software vendor. &quot;Fraud&quot; implies that the victimized party has been manipulated into surrendering something of value under false pretenses. That doesn't really apply to these cases.</p>
<p>Gruber's suggestion of &quot;bootleggers&quot; is better than &quot;fraud&quot;, but it's unfortunately normative in that most people now consider Prohibition (which is what most people think of when they hear &quot;bootlegging&quot;) to have been an unreasonable imposition by the government — as a result, in this case the terminology would imply that software appropriation is legitimate.</p>
<p>A better description would be &quot;freeloaders&quot;, as users of unlicensed proprietary software are extracting value from a system without supporting it themselves. It also has a pun in it, since they're &quot;loading&quot; the software on their machines! Obviously this should count as a major strike against it.</p>
<p>Even though I couldn't resist leaving in an irrelevant quote beating up on them, in the end I have to side with the BSA. Not because &quot;piracy&quot; is a great term for software theft — it's manipulative and inaccurate — but because <em>that's what we have been and will continue to call it</em>.</p>
<p>I don't mean to just rail against the evolution of language in a reflexive, let's-bitch-about-political-correctness sort of way. But the fact that some people are suddenly feeling guilty for previously having a whimsical attitude toward all things piratical strikes me as pretty silly. Surprise: there are a lot of idioms with horrific literal meanings that we regularly deploy lightheartedly — &quot;highway robbery&quot;, &quot;scared to death&quot;, &quot;thrown under the bus&quot; — these would all be unpleasant things to experience! Tragedy + time = comedy and all that. Enjoying the amusing caricature of piracy that we've developed over the last several decades is not the same thing as dismissing the horrors of real-life piracy.</p>
<p>Now: who wants to play some Halo 3 tonight? I promise to feel at least little bad when I use the sniper rifle.</p>

                    <p>Becks is right: this <a class="reference external" href="http://www.unfogged.com/archives/week_2009_04_05.html#009718">FML phenomenon is intolerable</a>. I don't really agree with her complaint about its negativity being the problem, though. The problem is that it isn't negative <em>enough</em>. The people participating in this meme are doing it wrong.</p>
<p>The phrase &quot;fuck my life&quot; is a setup for comedy about hopelessness, but it's being adopted by people who don't understand either of those things. Most of the entries on <a class="reference external" href="http://www.fmylife.com">FML</a> are about minor inconveniences or embarrassments. #whoops! would be a more apt hashtag.</p>
<p>There are occasional outliers that begin to get at the point of the exercise (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.fmylife.com/work/850361">this</a> is on the right track, though the execution is clunky). But it's clear that most of the entries are from fresh-faced twenty year-olds who rarely, if ever, find themselves using the phrase &quot;alone in an uncaring universe&quot;. For these jokes to work their implications need to stretch further into the future than next week. Otherwise the natural response is, &quot;That's too bad, but I'm sure things will pick up soon.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I was remiss in not linking to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.en-dash.com/blog">Jake</a>'s <a class="reference external" href="http://dumbfml.tumblr.com/">effort to highlight the worst FMLs</a>. And it reminds me to mention my other objection to this whole business: how transparently fake most of the entries are. Really, some slight effort toward plausibility is not too much to ask.</p>

<p>This was pretty disappointing to see, both as a friend and as someone who enjoys reading quality journalism about tech policy. However!

                    <p>I haven't seen <em>Watchmen</em> yet — Emily and I were traveling last night, bound for a quick vacation in Texas. Just about the time everyone else was suffering through &quot;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJRthpxDM10">Citizen Solder</a>&quot; I was tucking into an enormous plate of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.chuys.com/location.html">delicious blue corn tortillas</a>. So I say this based on the comic, not the film.</p>
<p>But of course <a class="reference external" href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/tapped_archive?month=03&amp;year=2009&amp;base_name=in_defense_of_the_penis">Phoebe's right</a> that there's a double standard when it comes to female and male nudity in films, and our discomfort at either is a bit silly. <em>Watchmen</em> seems like an odd time to make that case, though, because here the nudity is used precisely <strong>because</strong> we're uncomfortable with it. Dr. Manhattan wanders around naked, and that seems odd to us. But it doesn't seem odd to him because he's a superbeing that's almost completely alienated from humanity. To him a body is a construct, and it's impossible to understand the social conventions surrounding it or anything else. If the audience was similarly blasé about Dr. M striding about in his deathday suit there wouldn't be any point to showing him doing so.</p>

<p>My throwaway holiday entertainment will be <em>The Spirit</em>, but there is no movie that I'm more excited about than Darren Aronofsky's take on those who live their lives in and around the squared circle. The combination of idiotic childhood nostalgia and its underpinning layers of genuine, lately-discovered pathos is incredibly heady. Go ahead, look me in the eye and try to tell me that you wouldn't want to read a novel about Optimus Prime's painful divorce.</p>

                    <p>I rewatched <em>Aliens</em> over the weekend, and man: that's a pretty good movie!</p>
<p>I do have one other thought to share, though. And it's this: you hear a lot about how influential the production design in <em>Blade Runner</em> was, and that certainly seems true. But within the context of the <em>Alien</em> franchise, most of the attention is paid to H. R. Giger's creature designs. That seems to me to significantly underestimate the influence that the rest of the film's designs have had. In particular its portrayal of the marines and their equipment has been embraced/stolen by virtually every science fiction videogame franchise since. Some of this is just pragmatic — it's easy to make big, boxy vehicles; having an LED ammo counter on a weapon avoids the need for an extra HUD element — but to a large extent these ideas have been taken up because they're just <em>really good designs</em>. At this point they've been reused so often that they more or less form the baseline for any depiction of futuristic infantry.</p>
<p>Now of course both <em>BR</em> and the first <em>Alien</em> movie were directed by Ridley Scott, so it makes no sense to propose an under/overrated auteur dynamic. <em>Aliens</em> was helmed by James Cameron, and as a sequel it's necessarily more of an evolution of the preceding movie's aesthetic (which itself was less original than <em>BR</em>) than an original universe. But I'd argue that while <em>BR</em> had an immediate impact on the people making our popular culture, <em>Aliens</em> was quietly internalized by a generation of future game designers who have only recently begun making their presence known as both they, and their chosen medium, have come of age.</p>

That's not saying much, of course, since Law &amp; Order is a terrible, terrible franchise. Still, check out the plot summary as I related it to <a class="reference external" href="http://movering.com">Emily</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">There was a girl found shot but then she wasn't but it turned out to be her twin, except then also she had tiger bites on her, so of course they figured it was the tiger of this rap star (played by the guy from Outkast), but DNA proved it wasn't, so then Big Boi says the girl was part of an exotic animal smuggling ring and takes Stabler to them posing as a customs official who wants to become corrupt, and he steals some hair and it was THAT TIGER, but then Big Boi gets eaten by hyenas (which we know because a CSI said &quot;check out that hyena vomit&quot; and his chain was in it) so then Stabler goes back to the smugglers and tries to become better friends and sees a lady with a weird vest and the bad guys say &quot;everyone is always picturing her naked, they don't stop to think about whether she's smuggling turtle eggs&quot;, which proves how ingenious (aka evil) they are.</div>
<div class="line">SO the bad guys keep feeling out Stabler as a fake customs agent and they want him to help smuggle a VERY RARE GIBBON, and he does but they get suspicious and shoot him, but he's okay and they set up a sting at the airport where the gibbon is being brought into the country via a basketball, and they catch the bad guys in the act of selling it to an asian guy and the bad guys say &quot;gentleman, there are now only SIXTEEN of these gibbons left in the wild, hahaha.&quot;</div>
<div class="line">But then the cops arrive and everyone runs over rooftops and almost falls down, except it turns out one of the two bad guys was an undercover cop all along and the other smuggler is JUST THE TIP OF THE ANIMAL SMUGGLING ICEBERG!</div>
<div class="line">whew</div>
<div class="line">so that's how it ended</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, the MPAA may hunt you down (like so many gibbons) if you <a class="reference external" href="http://isohunt.com/torrent_details/53395617/svu?tab=summary">illegally download the episode</a>. But are you really prepared to depend on NBC's rerun-scheduling caprice when it comes to something so obviously awesome?</p>

                    <p>The new Bond movie: I liked it! The only film in the series that it seems worthwhile to compare it to is <em>Casino Royale</em>, and on that score it's a mixed bag. On the one hand, <em>Quantum of Solace</em>'s best parts are not as good as those of <em>Casino Royale</em>, if only because they don't involve awesome footchases built around parkour. On the other hand, <em>QoS</em>'s worst parts manage to avoid the inclusion of high-stakes poker tournaments run by the villain, by which point in the movie it has been established that the local police force is in Bond's pocket so why don't they just arrest this guy anyway?</p>
<p>Seriously: a poker tournament?! I can only assume that the people responsible for that decision will one day look back upon it and be as deeply ashamed as if they had written a getaway chase set on razor scooters, or a part for a villainous master-blogger, or an Aston Martin with an advanced camouflage system based on hypercolor t-shirt technology. Topicality is not the Bond series' strong suit. Also, as evil character tics go, having an inhaler is pretty lame — particularly if it isn't used to kill anybody.</p>
<p>The new movie avoided those sorts of problems, instead opting for the more commonly accepted practice of just having lots of enormous plot holes. Why are the villains eschewing petrotyranny in favor of a plot to extract a somewhat higher profit margin on municipal water in Bolivia (the dastards!)? Why was that exploding hotel built out of hydrogen, again?</p>
<p>But all this is well within acceptable action movie tolerances, and Daniel Craig is pretty awesome. Also: I liked the title, dammit! I must reluctantly conclude that those who disagree are just mean.</p>

<p>Gears of War 2 has been acquired, partly on the strength of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/11/03/081103fa_fact_bissell?currentPage=all">this New Yorker profile of its lead designer</a>, sent to me by my coworker Brian (be sure to also check out <a class="reference external" href="http://www.magicalwasteland.com/2008/10/in_any_guise_a_poor_ambassador.htm">this comments-section exchange</a> between the author and a critic, which <a class="reference external" href="http://doombot.com/">Jason</a> pointed out to me). It's shaping up to be the biggest Xbox release of the holiday season. If you'd like to come find me on XBL, my gamertag is Club Loser. Let me assure you: I'm quite bad.</p>
<p>I realize it's curmudgeonly of me, but I can't help but be dismayed by this generation's videogame franchises. Back in my day (<em>*stretches, pats belly*</em>) our shooters stuck to paper-thin premises that were patently ludicrous and profoundly derivative, but which provided plenty of room for awesome non-sequiturs. There's, uh, <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_(video_game)">a portal to hell on Mars</a>? And things are coming through it? Sure, let's go with that — <em>Aliens</em> was pretty awesome, right? Or hey, maybe there's an <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quake_3">intergalactic</a> <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unreal_tournament">tournament</a> where kidnapped fighters from all over the galaxy are brought and forced to fight for some reason? It was cool when it happened to Bruce Lee, and he didn't even have a rocket launcher.</p>
<p>These days, things are a bit more homogenous and overengineered. The two biggest shooter franchises for Xbox are <em>Halo</em> and <em>Gears of War</em>. In one of them, superhumans on a distant planet are locked in a pitched battle against vaguely reptilian alien hordes driven by a crazed prophetic religion. In the other, superhumans on a distant planet are locked in a pitched battle against vaguely insectoid alien hordes who seem to feel it's not polite to discuss religion in a social or battlefield setting.</p>
<p>All of this is fine. The resulting <a class="reference external" href="http://news.teamxbox.com/xbox/15374/Gears-of-War-Novel-Update-Movie-Script-Confirmed/">movies and novelizations</a> are irritating in principle, but also fine so long as you avoid watching or reading them — people like making money, after all. What's very, very irritating, though, is the compulsory delusion among the fanboy set which maintains that the settings and plots for these games are anything other than incredibly awful, derivative, sub-fanfic-level dreck, utterly unworthy of respect or serious consideration. Instead I end up reading gaming press pieces which assume that I know or care what the Pillar of Autumn is, or which include quotes from the games' creators that say things like &quot;we think there's a lot more to explore in the Halo universe&quot;. Sure! Of course! Who wouldn't want to see what wonders await us in a fictional world that includes ideas as original as lasers and machineguns and jeeps (oh, the jeeps!). Also there's a bunch of stuff stolen from <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ringworld">Larry Niven</a>, but with fewer words.</p>
<p>I suppose I should just avoid those articles. But I need to know about the comparative deadliness of the next rocket launcher iteration! Or which add-on maps I'm going to be forced to buy! Or the next initiative that will try (and fail) to make teenagers on Xbox Live a bit less racist and homophobic.</p>
<p>None of this actually diminishes my excitement at the prospect of brutalizing strangers' avatars from the comfort of my home. There's skill involved, the gameplay is well-tuned, and it's thrilling to win. I just wish there were fewer pretentious narrative trappings surrounding the experience — or, if we really can't pare things down to a minimal core of deadliness, that the narrative filigrees could be made with a sense of good humor rather than just the idiot earnestness of the hack-who-doesn't-know-it.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Also: to put all this into perspective, I spent yesterday playing laser tag.</p>

<p>That's right: my overpowering masculinity extends far; yea, even unto the document object model.</p>
<p>Actually, though, I think I probably got this result in a nontypical way, as my browser history currently contains no links to ESPN. The most incriminating domains on my list include <a class="reference external" href="http://jeroenwijering.com">jeroenwijering.com</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://digikey.com">digikey.com</a> and, um, <a class="reference external" href="http://washingtontimes.com">washingtontimes.com</a> (I don't read it for the articles! I swear!).</p>
<p>That, or maybe the script noticed that yesterday I read <a class="reference external" href="http://radaronline.com/exclusives/2008/08/tucker-max-responds.php">an article about Tucker Max</a>. Based on that datum alone the script should not only be able to tell that I'm male but also that I'm an asshole.</p>

                    <p>I realize that our national conversation about Batman is already more or less over, but the weighty responsibilities of internet citizenship can't be shirked so easily. So: Emily and I went to see the new Batman movie on Friday, with <a class="reference external" href="http://doombot.com">Jason</a>, Gen, Sarah and two nice folks who disappeared so quickly that I'm not sure they were ever there at all. Mr. and Ms. Soze, we'll call them (now and then not again).</p>
<p>Emily hated it, and at the time this prompted me to stick up for the movie in an attempt to defend the institution of comic book adaptations. They've only grossed, what, a billion dollars this summer? Clearly this struggling art form needs our support.</p>
<p>But now, thinking about it some more, I have some complaints.</p>
<p>Here's the thing about the Batman movie: I want to signal my approval. Christopher Nolan is clearly thinking about Batman in the right way; the actors associated with the franchise are all doing an excellent job of adapting an awkwardly large and sometimes-cartoonish mythology into a filmed perspective that is as realistic as is realistically possible. The basic thesis of the movie was a good one, too, and an appropriate arc for the second movie of a Batman reboot. The movie looks right, it sounds right, it moves right.</p>
<p>My only real problem with the film was everything that happens in it. Spoilers:</p>
<p>Why are we going to Hong Kong? Why are we giving all the &quot;terrible binary choice&quot; schemes to the Joker instead of the duality- and choice-obsessed Two-Face? Why are we suddenly inserting hamfisted topical controversies into our final act, and then using it as an excuse to pollute our climactic action scene with unimpressive and confusing CGI? Why is the culmination of the Joker's devotion to chaos a bunch of people on a barge <em>putting their votes in a hat?</em> Remember when people were running screaming from poison blimps as Jack Nicholson's admittedly-ludicrous Joker gleefully presided over the deadly parade festivities? Wasn't that much, much better?</p>
<p>Also, why is the mayor wearing so much eye makeup?</p>
<p>But as I said, I want to signal my approval: these are basically the right people to put in charge of Batman. And I <a class="reference external" href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/ezraklein_archive?month=07&amp;year=2008&amp;base_name=the_future_of_superhero_movies#107833">completely agree with Ezra</a> when he says that the superhero movie genre has much more life left in it than many people realize. The archetypal nature of these characters makes them uniquely suited to big movies that are somewhat less stupid than can be reasonably expected. It's nice to be able to entrust beloved franchises to professionals who recognize that opportunity and want to do right by it, instead of giving it to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.imdb.com/find?q=joel+schumacher&amp;sourceid=mozilla-search">incompetents</a> or shame-faced wannabe-artistes who're looking for a payday to tide them over until they can shoot another doomed small film about terminal illness or divorce.</p>
<p>Now I just want them to hire Bruce Timm and Paul Dini to write the script. Although they can keep whoever came up with the thing with the dude with the cellphone. That was pretty awesome.</p>

I have to defer to Spencer's greater familiarity with the franchise, but this seems all wrong to me. The Hulk is afraid of himself and his lack of self-control. He's defined by rage, isolation and the hopelessness of ever achieving normality. He's a teenage boy, in other words, Peter Parker but with a worse temper and gloomier attitude. Hulk is for anyone who's felt like the anger welling up inside of them could destroy the world, and been unsure if they liked the idea.
I mean, yes, radiation, etc. But that was just the unknowable technology of the day.</li>

<li><strong>McDonald's &quot;Southern Style&quot; Chicken Sandwich</strong> As the commercial points out, this is less a fried chicken and pickle sandwich than an ascendant generation's rallying cry. These people have different habits — and tastes! And they're <em>not</em> going to submit to the tyranny of traditional breakfast, old man. Also, the chicken is juicy and perfectly seasoned, two points which I'm mentioning in an entirely ordinary, conversational way.
I wanted to reach out to the screen and plaintively tell these hip young sandwich consumers that I, too, have eaten chicken for breakfast. I understand! Oh god, take me with you! But their faces would have been no less implacable had they been in the room instead of on the screen. My time is over. I must go into the West, and diminish.</li>
<li><strong>Liberty/Freedom/Independence Disposable Catheters:</strong> DID YOU KNOW that a recent Medicare decision means that you no longer have to suffer with reusable catheters? I sure was sick of the tedious boiling and sterile procedure associated with my reusable catheters. But it was hard for a comparatively sexy, somewhat vivacious catheter user like myself to find time to call. Finally, my mother (STILL ALIVE) convinced me. Boy, am I glad I did! The folks at Liberty/Freedom/Independence were so friendly (YOU WILL BE LESS ALONE), and now I have much more time for my active lifestyle, pictured here (GINGERLY BENDING DOWN TO PET CAT). I use Liberty/Freedom/Independence every time I &quot;cath&quot;! (EW)</li>

I have to admit that I'm not familiar with much of Orson Welles' body of work beyond <em>Citizen Kane</em> and his famous <em>War of the Worlds</em> broadcast. So I had assumed that there was no more complete and cruel affirmation of Welles' final, nihilistic hopelessness than his next-to-last acting credit: <a class="reference external" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092106/">the voice of Unicron in the Transformers movie</a>. But it appears that history has come up with innovative new sleights since then.</p>
<p>Within <em>F for Fake</em> there's a monologue about Chartes Cathedral in which Welles expresses the idea that our individual impermanence doesn't imply futility — that there's dignity to be had in the moment and within our collective history. It's quite beautiful.</p>
<p>Anyway, be sure to check out the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/comment_servlet?all_comments&amp;v=pUrKCUTUSPo">associated Youtube comments</a>, which together form a convincing rebuttal. I especially like the one comparing Welles' work (unfavorably) to that of Quentin Tarantino.</p>

<p>Exciting! I have to admit that the Avengers aren't really a franchise I enjoy. Norse gods? Archers? It's kind of weak, and their rogue's gallery is even worse. The arbitrary combination of dissimilar characters ends up robbing each of their archetypal punch.</p>
<p>But I suppose the Ultimates titles have breathed some life into the comic world, and lord knows that the further our society moves toward exclusively serving the tastes of teenage boys the wiser and more culturally relevant I seem. So my official position is one of support.</p>
<p>Relatedly: I forgot to mention it when it debuted, but check it out — I'm momentarily famous:</p>
<p>I <em>knew</em> there was a reason I saved that Halloween costume (besides, of course, the frankly embarrassing amounts of time and money that went into it). I just wish someone had told me that my hood was billowing inappropriately. Anyway, many thanks to <a class="reference external" href="http://pygmalioninablanket.blogspot.com">the Nabob</a> for inviting me to be a part of the filming.</p>

                    <p>We're now ten weeks in, and I have to say that I don't think things look very good for the writer's strike. The late night shows are back on the air and beardier than ever. The country is contemplating a canceled Oscar season, and is not happy about it. We had an understanding: citizens will be subjected to Billy Crystal, Whoopi Goldberg and jokes written by Bruce Vilanch for one (1) six hour period per annum. It's like tossing a virgin into the volcano — a nasty business to be sure, but better than the alternative. With the telecast canceled, who knows where that banality will erupt? We're living in fear, and all because of those greedy writers and their obsession with receiving &quot;fair&quot; &quot;compensation&quot; for their &quot;work&quot;.</p>
<p>Perhaps even more damning to the writers' cause, <em>American Gladiators</em> has successfully relaunched without them — and given a beleaguered nation hope. It's impossible to watch an episode without wondering whether any profession successfully excluded from the series' production really has anything to do with American Greatness at all. They really do get along fine without writers: it turns out that you can just hire a few new &quot;associate producers&quot; from a given pile of spec scripts, tell them to do their best, and then fill in the gaps in Mr. Hogan's dialogue with the word &quot;brother&quot;. Layla Ali's lilting monotone is impossible to pay attention to anyway, and viewers can be counted on to be distracted by the contestants' varying but always-present personality disorders. It's a winning formula.</p>
<p>The strain is beginning to show in some other areas, though. Last night I saw an ad for Jessica Alba's <a class="reference external" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0406759/">The Eye</a>. When considered in the context of Eliza Dushku's <a class="reference external" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0364817/">Tru Calling</a> and Jennifer Love Hewitt's <a class="reference external" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0460644/">Ghost Whisperer</a>, it seems that, as <a class="reference external" href="http://dccharles.blogspot.com">Charles</a> put it, &quot;All of the girls we thought were gorgeous when we were 15 are now psychic.&quot; I'm not complaining, mind you; I'm simply noting that there's a wide variety of wrongful-death-avenging superpowers that a writerless Hollywood is currently neglecting.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>Last night I stumbled across HBO's half-hour promo for season 5 of The Wire. Previous seasons have addressed the police, local politics, unions and schools. This season is supposed to take a characteristically blunt look at the media. The preview was, uh, surprising — for a couple of reasons:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Joe Klein is featured as the voice of downtrodden journalism! For some reason he was selected to express the concerns of the in-the-trenches, unheralded-hero reporter. My journalist friends assure me that this was an <em>especially</em> inspired choice for representing those who are asked to &quot;do more with less&quot; (after all, he <a class="reference external" href="http://www.salon.com/opinion/greenwald/2007/11/26/klein/index.html">apparently</a> makes do without fact checkers).</li>
<li>David Simon does not care for the internet. Yeah, superficial attention was paid to the increasingly hard-headed, businesslike approach of the news industry. But that complaint's well-worn and was consequently skimmed over. Mostly, the writers and talking heads from the Baltimore Sun seemed eager to complain about newspapers' willingness to give their content away on the web. That they consider this a strategic mistake rather than an inevitable capitulation demonstrates an understanding of the world that's uncharacteristically shallow for something associated with this franchise.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, it'd be dumb to write off the coming season on the basis of a promotional special. David Simon's political philosophy seems to run more along the lines of &quot;everything's fucked, all the time&quot; than toward simple scapegoating. So perhaps the carping crammed into that thirty minutes was simplistic by necessity.</p>
<p>But the promo was still discouraging. I worry that Simon's writerly pretensions might make him unduly lionize the big city newsroom, an environment that seems like a lot of fun for entitled smartasses who self-describe as &quot;scrappy&quot;, but which increasingly seems like a 20th century quirk that's no longer economically sustainable. I admit I'm as likely to bitchily lament the loss of a free ride as anyone — but then I'm not a journalist, and I haven't got a TV show to run. Those who do saw fit to include in this promotional program the Sun's television critic, who cites the paper's employment of only <em>one</em> such TV critic as evidence of newsprint's decline. To this, one can only say <em>FUCK YOU</em>: the internet has made it very, very clear that having opinions about TV is not something for which people need to be compensated. The amount of self-awareness on display in the promo show was less than inspiring.</p>
<p>So I confess I'm a little worried. Simon's provided cutting, complex critiques of police, politicians and schools. And admittedly, he's done this despite his co-creator Ed Burns having a personal stake in two of those three systems. But I wonder if Simon will be able to confront these simple facts: that business models based on the difficulty of distributing information are no longer viable; and that the media's vulnerability to competition from amateur blogospheric efforts is, rather than an unfortunate cosmic injustice, almost entirely the result of the industry's failure to implement a proper meritocracy. The fifth season promo's inkstained hagiography was not encouraging on this score.</p>
<p>The Wire's different and great because it seems more honest than anything else on television. But this season's the first in which its creator is going to be writing about himself and his friends. I imagine they'll probably pull it off, but the early signs are not good.</p>

<p>Of greater potential interest: <strong>Futurama (Bender's Big Score)</strong> — disappointing! I've read the continuity-obsessed script described as an attempt to reward loyal fans, but it comes off more as an attempt by the (presumably) new writers to prove that they've watched the original series carefully. It's great that they enjoyed those episodes. I did, too! But the invocation of their jokes often amounts to repetition. The whole experience reminded me of finding myself at a party, stuck listening to someone recite genuinely funny material that I could already recollect perfectly well without the benefit of a new, much worse performance.</p>
<p>On a more positive note, I should mention that there's a sass-talking robot.</p>

<p>&quot;Maybe we make it single-camera and don't have a laugh track and play some OK Go in the background, because we want people to think <em>we</em> think that we're hip and unconventional. But really we're as completely ordinary as we can possibly be at this moment in time.&quot;</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>I realize that many <a class="reference external" href="http://www.tvsquad.com/2007/09/24/six-creeps-id-rather-date-than-vh1s-mystery/">already have</a>, but I think we need to talk about Mystery. I only became aware of the guy recently, as he unexpectedly began appearing on various TV shows that play in the background of my usual late night routine (which usually consists of fervently trying to load ROMs onto something or other).</p>
<p>I guess that Mystery's gotten himself a publicist and is making the rounds. I realize that in my own small way I'm playing into his hands by writing this. But I can't help it. He's just so awful.</p>
<p>He's also the host of a reality show on VH1 that's devoted to teaching guys how to pick up girls. Mystery is a pick-up artist, you see — the world's greatest, apparently, although it seems difficult to find solid metrics about this sort of thing. He's tall and not bad looking, although his wardrobe makes it instantly obvious that at some point in the past Pam Anderson and Tommy Lee had a garage sale. He paints his fingernails black. He used to be a magician.</p>
<p>I have to confess that I've never seen his VH1 show. I also haven't read Neil Strauss's book <em>The Game</em>, in which I'm told Mystery plays a prominent role (as you all know, I refuse to read any books that aren't about wizards). I'm speaking from a position of blessed ignorance.</p>
<p>But I have visited <a class="reference external" href="http://www.venusianarts.com/sl/va/VenusianArts.aspx">Mystery's website</a>, which he runs with a guy called Matador. &quot;Wait a minute,&quot; you may be saying, &quot;I'm beginning to think that these guys aren't using their real names!&quot; Right you are, my sharp-witted reader! It seems that people in Mystery's line of work like to use pseudonyms — like bloggers, except with venereal disease instead of comment spam. For example, the coauthors of Mystery's book include Lovedrop, Style, Sinn, Wilder, and Toecutter (Style is Neil Strauss). My favorite is <a class="reference external" href="http://www.thundercatseductionlair.com/2007/09/mystery-and-gre.html">Thundercat</a>, who I found while googling in support of this post (bonus: he describes a Daily Show &quot;sketch&quot; as &quot;chick humor&quot;). Mystery was well-prepared for pseudonymity, having already <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_%28venusian_artist%29#Biography">legally inserted</a> an unnecessary &quot;Von&quot; into his name in his early twenties.</p>
<p>Back to the website. It's pretty sad. Not because there are 473 of 500 backstage passes available for the next seminar, or even because it's running on a Microsoft webserver. No, it's the testimonial video. You really need to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcEo_HTKGFA">see it for yourself</a>, but for those unable to watch at work, allow me to summarize.</p>
<p>Three former students of Matador recount their experience at the &quot;backstage&quot; portion of a seminar. It's instantly clear how these men have been instructed to make their appearance more appealing to the opposite sex.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line"><img alt="some poor sucker" class="center" src="/static/2007/09/26/mystery_1.jpg" style="width: 422px; height: 317px;" /></div>
</div>
<p>&quot;You! The paunchy guy! Bleach some of your hair! Think 'guy who runs the sound board at a Fallout Boy show' — that's what we're going for.&quot;</p>
<p><img alt="image1" class="center" src="/static/2007/09/26/mystery_2.jpg" style="width: 422px; height: 317px;" /></p>
<p>&quot;You! Yes, the gentleman who looks unnervingly like the older brother of Tom's friends Jon and Mark. Your look will be 'the neck'. Girls love necks — they practically insist on them! You want to direct as much attention as possible to the area between your clavicles. Go!&quot;</p>
<p><img alt="image2" class="center" src="/static/2007/09/26/mystery_3.jpg" style="width: 422px; height: 317px;" /></p>
<p>&quot;As for you... well, uh. Hmm. How about you just try to appear in silhouette as much as possible? That might work, right?&quot;</p>
<p>Just listen to these poor dopes talk about the experience. It's all about how great Matador was at performing &quot;sets&quot; and &quot;going caveman&quot;. Yes, it sounds like Matador is awfully good at adhering to the principles of the system he invented to describe the things that he does. Similarly, I'm currently in the twenty-seventh year of a record-defying game of TomBall.</p>
<p>None of the gentlemen pictured above mention the girls that they've gotten as a result of paying $4000 to cretins. That, they presumably presume, will come later. It's a bad presumption, though (theirs, not mine — my presumption is fine). For one thing, these seminars seem likely to attract the least-promising students available. It's like those real estate seminars you see advertised late at night on channels that required the use of the second, clickier TV knob back when you where a kid. While it's true that some people make a lot of money at real estate speculation, it's also true that paying someone thousands of dollars to tell you that you should staple some signs to utility poles is not an effective way to gain admission to the plutocracy.</p>
<p>But the bigger problem is the lack of focus. For a bunch of guys desperate to improve their luck with the ladies, these three sure seem to have hard-ons for their greasy instructor. It's understandable: talking to strangers while wearing strange new clothes is hard. It would be much easier if you were less insecure — and surely someone who's enough of a jackass to call himself &quot;Matador&quot; must be comfortable in his own artificially-tanned skin. The goal gets shifted: before they know it they're simply trying to continue hanging out with a more dominant male, and paying to do so.</p>
<p>It's all right there on the website. Just check out Mystery's personal guarantee:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">&quot;If you are at all dissatisfied with my Training program, after you have fully attended all three days, I insist that you approach me on Sunday night, after the training is over.</div>
<div class="line">&quot;You can do so discreetly; I will not embarrass or expose you in front of other students — remember, you're family now.</div>
<div class="line">&quot;Explain to me the nature of your concern, and I will personally see to it that it will be addressed by me or my staff, as quickly as humanly possible.</div>
<div class="line">&quot;Should I still be unable to provide the value that you expect from me, I will gladly and promptly refund your attendance fees, including the (normally non-refundable) deposit.</div>
<div class="line">&quot;And guess what? We'll still stay friends. That's my commitment to you.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Hear that? Mystery — the man who's in the business of inventing ways to bypass women's agency and capacity for critical thought, reducing them to consumable objects to power his reality shows and ejaculations — respects and admires <em>you</em> as an individual. So much so, in fact, that the deep friendship forged by your commercial interaction trumps his desire to charge $4k to the Mastercard you applied for outside the campus dining hall. Even though he could buy a pretty sweet fuzzy hat with that money (and he could really use a new fuzzy hat). No, it's more important that the two of you stay friends. And seriously, as soon as his schedule frees up he'll swing by your folks' basement for that game of Halo you've been talking about. He hasn't played before, but he bets you're really good!</p>
<p>I know this, because it happened to me. During my freshman year of college I lived in a dorm suite that had a doorbell made from scrounged parts before the sun set on our first collegiate day. By the end of the semester it would also house an animatronic Tigger doll. I liked my suitemates a lot, and we all got pretty good at Starcraft. But there was no denying that the devout Christian guy was the second-coolest person among us.</p>
<p>But the first-coolest was Dave. Dave was friendly, short, and very successful with women. I hung out with Dave, and superficially tried to figure out how <em>I</em> could become the one to pull the fire alarm in the middle of the night to get my roommate out of the room, allowing me to lock the door behind myself and a coed. But soon I just mostly just trying to hang out with Dave. He was charming and self-assured, and having that all the time seemed even better than having drunken sexual encounters some of the time. But it didn't make me any more charming, or get me any more girls.</p>
<p>Ugh. I have to admit, though, that I'm kind of fascinated by this awful, awful scene. Much like when Kriston regaled the Jagermeister promotional team with the true, sordid origin of their employer's wares, I think it would be pretty fun to catch it <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seduction_community#Approaching_and_opening">in action</a> and have a chat with them about it. To McFadden's!</p>

                    <p>From the bizarre opening <a class="reference external" href="http://www.showbox.co.kr/">production company logo</a> to the moment in the climactic battle when the dragon goes through puberty, that was just about everything that one could ask for from a Korean dragon-versus-dragon movie. Along with awesome CGI and memorable catchphrases (&quot;What are you talking about?&quot;; &quot;That doesn't make any sense&quot;), it boasted the most convoluted plot in a movie of Asian provenance that I've witnessed since my third viewing of <em>Ninja Scroll</em> revealed that the elite team of ninja monsters who poisoned the village's well did so in order to manipulate gold prices in a bid to destabilize the Tokugawa Shogunate. The fiends!</p>
<p>The actual dragon-on-dragon violence occurred in a modern-day Los Angeles where Americans spend most of their time brandishing guns and familiarizing themselves with obscure aspects of Korean culture. Sommer was at the football game, so I haven't yet been able to ask whether this constitutes a creative liberty. Either way, it won't diminish the reptilian awesomeness contained in D-War. I don't know if South Korean movies make it to the north end of the DMZ, but if they do I bet Kim Jong-Il is kicking himself for trading away his nuclear ambitions. Fuel oil isn't going to do squat against an angry Imoogi desperate for Yuh Yi Joo.</p>

                    <p>From Wired Magazine's June 2007 <em>Playlist</em> feature, because the bathroom at work will not be restocked with reading material until Nicco returns to DC in 2008 or the End of Days:</p>
<blockquote>
<em>Deadwood</em> fans in our office are still smarting over last year's cancellation of their favorite show. But they won't be able to resist writer David Milch's follow-up series, <em>John From Cincinnati</em>, which debuts June 10 on HBO. It's got mystic philosophizing, SoCal surfing, drug addiction, and a mysterious person (or is he an alien?) named John, who is most definitely <em>not</em> from Cincinnati. Plus, Rebecca De Mornay plays a smokin' grandma! What's not to like? Whereas <em>Deadwood</em> was lavish and profane (think Cormac McCarthy with Tourette's Syndrome), <em>JFC</em> is spare and spiritual (think William James with surfboards). But it's pure Milch, so expect another overnight cult hit with memorable taglines (&quot;Meet the fuckin' Jetsons!&quot;) and fanboy pilgrimages to Imperial Beach, California, where the series is set.</blockquote>
<p>Scrubbed from the first draft: a bunch of exclamation points and a bit about how our future society will be based upon <em>John From Cincinnati</em> and occasionally have to send George Carlin back through time to help David Milch score heroin/bibles.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p><a class="reference external" href="/2007/09/10/asdfr111/#comment-12993">Some</a> <a class="reference external" href="http://pygmalioninablanket.blogspot.com/2007/09/131.html">questions</a> have been raised about my and <a class="reference external" href="http://blogstretch.blogspot.com/2007/09/zomg.html">Amanda's</a> recent <em>Iron Man</em> advocacy. Allow me to offer a slightly more nuanced case <a class="reference external" href="/2007/09/10/asdfr111/">than I did last night</a>:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>First, as the Nabob points out, there's the Robert Downey Jr. factor. Consider the recent awesomeness of comic book movies. Now consider that the title of Greatest Living Superhero Actor is currently held by either Wesley Snipes or Christopher Reeve, depending on your personal taste and how carefully you read the criteria for winning the aforementioned title.
Robert Downey Jr. has the sort of genuine charisma that can only be learned by having to repeatedly explain to strangers why they just found you sleeping in their house. It comes through in his performances. In the preview his delivery of the script's lame jokes actually makes them seem sort of funny! Ask yourself: what if Sir Laurence Olivier had been cast in a role involving repulsor beams? What would cinema look like today? My guess: explodier.</li>
<li>Although I didn't think it was as great as <a class="reference external" href="http://www.movering.com">certain other people</a> did, <em>Transformers</em> did usher in a major new cinematic innovation: the &quot;how does the protagonist fare against U.S. military hardware?&quot; scene. It should soon take its place next to &quot;mistaken identity&quot;, &quot;<em>Rocky</em>-style training montage&quot;, &quot;going on two dates at once&quot;, and the two or three other dramatic conventions that screenwriters have at their disposal. In the preview, Iron Man, like, totally dusts some fighter jets, and you can tell the pilots are all &quot;Maaan&quot; but also have to admit that it was pretty sweet. I agree with those pilots, but my enthusiasm is unchecked by professional considerations.</li>
<li>Finally, the preview implies that the movie retells the Iron Man origin story more or less faithfully. Even though Iron Man is a second-string superhero, most nerds are well-acquainted with and attached to his origin story. This is because all subsequent Iron Man stories have kind of sucked, prompting the creators to revisit the origin story on a regular basis.
I don't think that deviation from the canon would have much of an effect on my enjoyment of the movie. But hearing nerds whine about it for the next eight months <em>would</em> have an effect on my enjoyment of the internet. So thanks in advance for sticking to the source text, Mr. Favreau.</li>
</ol>

Don't forget the accompanying Washington tradition: the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.donandmikewebsite.com/main.shtml">Don and Mike</a> Elvis Death Day Show.</p>
<p>I know it's shameful to be a shock jock apologist. But these are DC's homegrown shock jocks — I grew up listening to them, way back when they manned the morning show on a pre-Christian WAVA. I'll probably always have a soft spot for them, regardless of how vile and unfunny they can occasionally be. Besides, whatever your opinion of their daily show, there's really no better place to hear just what a weird dude Elvis Aaron Presley was on an annual basis. 3pm at the link above.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> The podcast of the show is now <a class="reference external" href="itms://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=114454618">available on iTunes</a>. It'll scroll into oblivion soon, so if you're interested in hearing about Elvis's weird sexual habits and astounding pharmaceutical intake, act now!</p>

                    <p>Kriston and Kate dragged Emily and I, kicking and screaming, out to get some culture last night, having purchased tickets to <em>Too Much Light Makes The Baby Go Blind</em> on our behalf. &quot;It's okay,&quot; Emily assured me, &quot;We can always leave and go see <em>Die Hard</em> — it's only a couple of blocks away.&quot;</p>
<p>But the play was great; if there are any performances with unsold tickets left, you should go. I thought the entirely serious pieces didn't work all that well, partly because there were so few of them and partly because they were a bit banal (yes, the Iraq War is bad; yes, Jesus probably wouldn't persecute gay people). But the rest of the plays were consistently hilarious, and never even a little boring.</p>

Wild</em> (known as <em>Born Survivor</em> in the UK):</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">To live up to his public image of a rugged, ex-SAS adventurer, it must have seemed essential for Bear Grylls to appear at ease sleeping rough and catching his own food in his television survival series.</div>
<div class="line">But it has emerged that Grylls, 33, was enjoying a far more conventional form of comfort, retreating some nights from filming in mountains and on desert islands to nearby lodges and hotels.</div>
<div class="line">Now Channel 4 has launched an investigation into whether Grylls, who has conquered Everest and the Arctic, deceived the public in his series Born Survivor.</div>
<div class="line">...</div>
<div class="line">[A]n adviser to <em>Born Survivor</em> has disclosed that at one location where the adventurer claimed to be a â€œreal life Robin-son Crusoeâ€? trapped on â€œa desert islandâ€?, he was actually on an outlying part of the Hawaiian archipelago and spent nights at a motel.</div>
<div class="line">On another occasion in Californiaâ€™s Sierra Nevada mountains where he was filmed biting off the head of a snake for breakfast and struggling for survival â€œwith just a water bottle, a cup and a flint for making fireâ€?, he actually slept some nights with the crew in a lodge fitted with television and internet access. The Pines Resort at Bass Lake is advertised as â€œa cosy getaway for familiesâ€? with blueberry pancakes for breakfast.</div>
<div class="line">In one episode Grylls, son of the late Tory MP Sir Michael Grylls, was shown apparently building a Polynesian-style raft using only materials around him, including bamboo, hibiscus twine and palm leaves for a sail.</div>
<div class="line">But according to Mark Weinert, an Oregon-based survival consultant brought in for the job, it was he who led the team that built the raft. It was then dismantled so that Grylls could be shown building it on camera.</div>
<div class="line">In another episode viewers watched as Grylls tried to coax an apparently wild mustang into a lasso in the Sierra Nevada. â€œIâ€™m in luck,â€? he told viewers, apparently coming across four wild horses grazing in a meadow. â€œA chance to use an old native American mode of transport comes my way. This is one of the few places in the whole of the US where horses still roam wild.â€?</div>
<div class="line">In fact, Weinert said, the horses were not wild but were brought in by trailer from a nearby trekking station for the â€œchoreographedâ€? feature.</div>

                    <p><em>John From Cincinnati</em>: still terrible, but now somewhat easier to spell. It's remarkable how little interaction the characters engage in. The show is mostly composed of aimless soliloquies. Admittedly, there will sometimes be some yelling about how one person is a disappointing son/mother/father/husband/wife, and the other is a disappointing opposite-of-that. But these fights quickly devolve into the characters speaking past one another, and then it's back to spouting disconnected profundities as if I was paying $10 a month to watch ponderous student films with strangely high production values.</p>
<p>Still, tonight was an improvement over week one, primarily because last week I missed the intro and so was pleasantly surprised to hear my favorite post-Clash Joe Strummer song being used for the opening music. Good job, HBO. Way to play songs I like when I'm not riding my bike back from U Street. Keep making those kinds of creative tweaks and you just might have another hit on your hands.</p>
<p>Despite this forward progress, <em>John From Cincinnati</em> remains a bad TV show. But I'm quickly developing a sense of apathetic tolerance toward it, like scar tissue forming around a foreign object (in my Sunday TV schedule). The human body, and in particular its desire not to get up from the couch, is an amazing thing.</p>
<p><em>Flight of the Conchords</em>: highly promising! Back in college I loved Tenacious D, but have been increasingly embarrassed about it ever since their album came out — it turned out that what I thought was a pretty funny joke wasn't actually the joke being told by the people doing the telling. These days I'm older, more sedate and, let's face it, quite a bit wussier. I'm glad to see that parodic folk-pop has finally caught up with my slowed-down outlook. Flight of the Conchords : Tenacious D :: VH1 : MTV. Except that makes it sound like I don't like the show and/or that I enjoy like VH1. I assure you that neither is the case.</p>

                    <p>Although it boasted the state of the art in product placement, collagen injection and tiresome Stan Lee cameos, I'm still going to have to give the new Fantastic Four movie a thumbs down. Emily says that it's silly to carp about the movie failing in ways that any reasonable person would expect it to fail. So while I was taken aback to find the writing well below even the &quot;doomed TNT original sitcom&quot; level of quality and closer to &quot;decent fanfic&quot;, maybe it's not fair to complain about the ways this expected-to-be-bad movie resembled... a bad movie. I paid for a bad movie, and that's what I got.</p>
<p>But disrespect for the Marvel canon? That just won't stand. The guy playing Dr. Doom seems like he would be better cast as a brooding new doctor on Grey's Anatomy than as the fearsome and merciless ruler of Latveria. And where the hell was Galactus? Yeah, that was a voracious-looking space cloud. But it boggles my mind that a creative process that settled on &quot;my bad&quot; and (immediately before the deployment of a cyclone-based attack) &quot;let's all go for a spin!&quot; as mots justes somehow decided to forego an awesome CG version of the comic book Galactus, presumably over worries that it might come off as cheesy.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> A proof that a giant dude with enormous metal sideburns <em>can</em> be made to look totally rad, I offer up this screencap from the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.marvelultimatealliance.com/">Marvel Ultimate Alliance</a> videogame, which I found on <a class="reference external" href="http://kungfurodeo.com/2006/09/27/marvel-ultimate-alliance-screen-captures/">this</a> webpage. Given that this is just from a videogame cutscene and that the FF movie seemed to have a pretty big SFX budget, I'm confident that the creators could have come up with something cool.</p>

                    <p>Like everyone else I just finished watching the Sopranos finale. Judging by the reaction among the folks I was watching with, opinions vary on exactly what the ending meant. I feel pretty strongly that Tony got popped. The cut to black occurred in the instant when Tony died.</p>
<p>Otherwise, what's the explanation for the final scene? A slice of Tony's life before life goes on? Nah. That makes no sense. The camera following Meadow was there to put us in the moment and make us start thinking about each shot as an immediate document of what was occurring at that instant. Otherwise it would've been wasted time in an obviously important sequence. And why would the camera have followed the guy in the gray jacket? Just to distract us during the culmination of the series?</p>
<p>No, Tony's gotta be dead. In <a class="reference external" href="http://grammarpolice.net/archives/001334.php">Kriston's comments</a> I mentioned that I thought Tony getting killed by a random, unknown killer was a possibility, and that it wouldn't be satisfying. But I was wrong — it was a good ending. It served nicely to underscore what I consider to be one of the series' central ideas: that violence is available to every living creature at every moment, despite all our fancy institutions, customs and frontal lobes. Those things just make its application a little more complicated.</p>
<p>The episode felt rushed as I watched it, but in retrospect cramming so much in makes sense. We had to be lulled into thinking everything was fine, proceeding as normal — that Tony might get prosecuted, or not, but generally continue to go about the business of a depressed Jersey mobster as defined by the past six seasons. I was even lulled into expecting a happy ending! But they pulled the rug out instead. I had expected something different, but I'm not sure what — or whether it could've been any better.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> There's a pretty good discussion of the ending over in <a class="reference external" href="http://matthewyglesias.theatlantic.com/archives/2007/06/more_sopranos_blogging.php">Matt's comments</a>. There are a bunch of folks interpreting the ending as intentionally ambiguous — a statement about Tony being condemned to live in perpetual suspense — but I don't really buy them. The camera laid things out in a pretty straightforward manner, I think. And my memory may be shaky, but I recall Tony being pretty relaxed in the final scene.</p>
<p><strong>ALLIES:</strong> Ezra's commenters <a class="reference external" href="http://ezraklein.typepad.com/blog/2007/06/sopranos_finale.html">seem to mostly agree with the Tony-got-whacked hypothesis</a>, and have some interesting theories about the episode title. More proof that the progressive blogosphere needs the fresh, objective eyes of a new generation and not the jaded establishment cabal represented by Yglesias and his ilk.</p>
<p><strong>WHILE I'M AT IT:</strong> John From Cincinnati was really abysmal. I was predisposed to dislike it sheerly on the basis of how hard it is to spell — the content of the show didn't do much to invalidate that prejudice. It came off as an SNL parody of a typical HBO drama: a troubled family in a quirky subculture; mannered, unrealistic characters who speak exclusively in non sequiturs, expository dialogue or profound-sounding riddles; a dash of magical realism; and, of course, the requisite heroin addict. I do like watching people surf, but Charles already owns <em>Blue Crush</em> on DVD. I'll probably still watch the next few episodes though, if only because changing channels is hard (and mostly fruitless on Sunday nights).</p>

<p>So, Boston's <a class="reference external" href="http://www.local10.com/news/10888268/detail.html">gone crazy</a> because Outsiders harnessed the fire from the sky to make graven images. Here's the part that really gets me:</p>
<blockquote>
The first device was found under Interstate 93, and the state police bomb squad was called and detonated the package in Sullivan Square just before 10 a.m. Officials said it contained an electronic circuit board with some components that were &quot;consistent with an improvised explosive device,&quot; but they said it had no explosives.</blockquote>
<p>Consistent with an IED. Right. So, assuming that these Cartoon Network signs weren't any more complex than they had to be, what components made them IED-equivalents?</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>power source (battery)</li>
<li>light source (LEDs)</li>
<li>wires</li>
<li>timer/controller (cheap IC or microcontroller)</li>
<li>maybe a light sensor (photodiode or photoresistor)</li>
<li>not explosives</li>
</ul>
<p>I have two qualifying devices on my person right now. Drop the photodiode requirement and I've got another three in my backpack. I count twelve in my line of sight.</p>
<p><img alt="photo of a painting of the Aqua Teen Hunger Force by Flickr user medildo" class="right" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/185/376138267_e263a1f245_o.jpg" />I get that it's sort of fun to follow federal protocols and act all serious. But c'mon — the number of mysterious electronic devices that come into our day to day lives is not going to suddenly begin declining. These signs were in several other towns for weeks without the cops freaking out and shutting down the city. Bostonians are just going to need to learn to deal with this kind of stuff. And I <em>really</em> don't like that CNN has inexplicably dragged my beloved <a class="reference external" href="http://www.makezine.com/blog/archive/2007/01/aqua_teen_hunge_1.html">MAKE Magazine</a> into this mess.</p>
<p>I don't mean to voice support for the ad campaign, of course, despite my affection for Aqua Teen Hunger Force. Guerilla marketers like <a class="reference external" href="http://www.interferenceinc.com/">Interference Inc.</a> (who appear to be behind this scheme) are <a class="reference external" href="http://www.dcist.com/archives/2006/03/27/verizon_this_do.php">scumbags</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://youthoughtwewouldntnotice.com/blog3/">thieves</a>, helping themselves to our public spaces and ripping off other people's art. But I'm even less fond of the humorless morons who shut down Boston and seem likely to drag <a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/medildo/tags/cartoonnetwork">Williams Street</a> into court.</p>
<p>Other than that, the whole thing's pretty funny. And I'm looking forward to hearing more about this from two outlets in particular: <a class="reference external" href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/">Bruce Schneier</a>, and <a class="reference external" href="http://boards.adultswim.com/adultswim/board/message?board.id=3&amp;message.id=448037&amp;jump=true">Adult Swim's black &amp; white bumps</a>.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> It's worse than I thought! From <a class="reference external" href="http://edition.cnn.com/2007/US/01/31/boston.bombscare/index.html">CNN</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
&quot;It had a very sinister appearance,&quot; Coakley told reporters. &quot;It had a battery behind it, and wires.&quot;</blockquote>
<p>Holy shit! I think I've got some sort of chronometric doomsday device looming over me <a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/376157604/">right now</a>!</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE 2:</strong> Check out alpha-geek <a class="reference external" href="http://www.bunniestudios.com/wordpress/?p=151">Bunnie Huang's response</a> to the incident.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE 3:</strong> MAKE has <a class="reference external" href="http://www.makezine.com/blog/archive/2007/02/boston_moonimit.html?CMP=OTC-0D6B48984890">close-up shots of one of the signs</a>. There's a few AA batteries, a voltage regulator, a small microcontroller, an inductor, what I think is an LED driver, a photoresistor, and a bunch of diodes, capacitors, resistors and LEDs. You could comfortably hold all of these components in your cupped palm. None of them costs much more than a dollar, and most are only a few cents. And, based on my admittedly amateur knowledge of electronics, none could destroy a major American city.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE 4:</strong> <a class="reference external" href="http://www.allthegooddomainsweretaken.com">Justin</a> sent along <a class="reference external" href="http://lgbusinesssolutions.typepad.com/solutions_to_grow_your_bu/2007/02/bombed_in_bosto.html">this</a> analysis of the campaign from a marketing perspective. The bizsolutions blogger thinks that making the campaign higher profile (by involving alternative media, among other things), these problems could have been avoided. I agree that putting a phone number on the signs for law enforcement (not the public) to call could have saved everyone a lot of trouble, but otherwise I disagree with this analysis. The whole point of the campaign is to evoke the subversive work of people like <a class="reference external" href="http://www.obeygiant.com/">Shepard Fairey</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://graffitiresearchlab.com/?page_id=19#video">Graffiti Research Labs</a>. Thinking of this as just another illuminated billboard totally misunderstands the Adult Swim brand and how it has been presented up to this point. AS viewers like the idea that they're in on a secret. The ideal outcome for this campaign was to get people talking and a bunch of threads started on message boards. Issuing directions, treating the campaign like a scavenger hunt and interviewing sign-finders on the HOT! 99.n Morning Show runs completely contrary to that idea. Cartoon Network's huge success is in part due to a huge amount of respect for its audience. It doesn't strike me as the sort of relationship that's compatible with traditional marketing techniques.</p>

<p>We get some really excellent toys in the office.

<p>This one's probably my favorite so far. Unfortunately the cranking mechanism isn't timed quite right, and the donuts usually end up sliding off Homer's mouth instead of down his gullet and into the collection tray. It's still pretty great, though.</p>

<p>I mostly just like this because it makes me feel better about the many times when a typo of mine has made it onto DCist. Also, it provided a handy excuse to put Photoshop CS3 through the paces (Review: it works! But it doesn't use the right style of brush cursor when you're zoomed in.).</p>

<div class="line">I was wondering when this was going to happen: <a class="reference external" href="http://edition.cnn.com/2006/SHOWBIZ/12/18/perez.hilton.ap/index.html">Perez Hilton is getting sued by the photographers whose photos he's been using</a>. I'm a as sympathetic an audience as Mr. Hilton could possibly hope for: I'm generally pretty hostile toward copyright litigation and I consider demeaning celebrities to be the lord's work. But even so, this seems extremely clear-cut to me: Perez is fucked; and if he genuinely thinks what he's been doing counts as fair use, then he's an idiot, too.</div>
<div class="line">I'm no lawyer, but Perez's inclusion of a photo in one of his posts doesn't strike me as a transformative act, and it seems entirely plausible to me that he's undercutting X17's ability to sell their work. I'm not allowed to steal content from The Onion, append my own witticisms and claim protection as satire. The fact that Perez is doing something funny with these photos does not automatically mean it falls under the fair use doctrine — besides, fair use is weak ground to stand on these days even when it's actually applicable.</div>
<div class="line">So yeah: he's fucked.</div>

<div class="line">Cyrus has <a class="reference external" href="http://cyrusfarivar.com/blog/?p=1164">a post linking to several articles profiling Borat's unwitting interview subjects</a>. I remember a bunch of these profiles coming out when Ali G got his big DVD-release PR push. Fake production companies, friendly assistants — just insist on meeting the on-air talent before the camera rolls and I think you can escape Mr. Baron-Cohen's traps.</div>
<div class="line">But, as you might imagine, the people who were duped aren't entirely happy. To their credit, few seem really outraged. But there is a recurring theme. From <a class="reference external" href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15175836/site/newsweek/">Newsweek</a>:</div>
</div>
<blockquote>
&quot;I was disappointed that Mr. Cohen never let me in on the joke,&quot; says Kathie Martin, who runs an etiquette school in Birmingham, Ala.</blockquote>
<p>From the <a class="reference external" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6071486.stm">BBC</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Washington DC public speaking coach Pat Haggerty also appears — and is seen trying to teach humour to Borat...</div>
<div class="line">&quot;About halfway through the session we took a break and I went up to one of the producers and said: 'This guy can't be real.</div>
<div class="line">&quot;'If you let me in on the gag, I will help you reach your goals because I don't care if you're from Kazakhstan, nobody is this crazy.'&quot;</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>From <a class="reference external" href="http://www.downtownexpress.com/de_179/howiwasduped.html">Linda Stein's firsthand account</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
Inspired segments of Borat and me were cut. At one point, Borat declared that men are stronger than women and held up two chairs to prove it. I did, too — although Iâ€™m only half his size</blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Last night, immediately before the Q&amp;A, John Hodgman forbade any questions that were wacky or funny. It didn't stop the middle-aged, slightly drunk government lawyers in the audience from defying their embarrassed wives' pleas and asking questions like, &quot;What is the meaning of life?&quot; But he was still right to try.</div>
<div class="line">What those interview subjects and assistant-counsels-in-charge-of-something-or-other don't understand is that guys like Hodgman and Baron-Cohen aren't looking for assistants. It would be nice if they were running a humorist fantasy camp where everyone could feel like part of the action, the same way that many NBA stars spend a few weeks each summer pretending that they enjoy playing games of Horse with aging corporate executives. But that's not what your ticket or selection as a interviewee gets you. To Hodgman, you're a customer. To Baron-Cohen, you're a prop. Just try to turn in a performance half as subtle and unselfconscious as that horse that falls down in the preview.</div>
<div class="line">Which brings me to the other thing about Borat: the exculpatory analyses of him are wishful thinking. Don't get me wrong — I think the character is hilarious, and by far the funniest of Baron-Cohen's creations. But the liberal-guilt-inspired line about Borat's humor being an attempt to lay our own prejudices bare? It's complete bullshit. Yes, &quot;<a class="reference external" href="http://onegoodmove.org/1gm/1gmarchive/2004/08/in_my_country_t_1.html">In My Country There Is Problem</a>&quot; showcases some entertainingly brazen country/western antisemitism. But most of Borat's interviews just show that Americans are patient, generous hosts. That isn't particularly funny.</div>
<div class="line">It's Borat himself that's funny, because he's a hilarious oaf. He looks foolish. He does dumb things. It's fun to laugh at him. But of course, this kind of humor has been employed in <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minstrel_show">awful ways</a> in the past.</div>
<div class="line">Now, the guilt-dodging excuse I favor is that Borat isn't actually parodying any specific ethnic or cultural group. He's a hodgepodge of stereotypes we have about eastern European otherness. He's certainly not a specific attempt to belittle the people of Kazakhstan (their <a class="reference external" href="http://www.avclub.com/content/node/53470">sadly defensive PR campaign</a> notwithstanding) — the only reason Borat hails from a specific country or speaks snippets of pidgin Polish is that he needs to interact with the outside world. These details convey some necessary authenticity; but they aren't meant to tie the character to any specific group of human beings. I don't really believe that Borat's antics are any more detestable than when Homer Simpson visited Crazy Vaclav's Place Of Cars (or blamed Tibor for his problems at work).</div>
<div class="line">But I may be fooling myself. I'd feel pretty uncomfortable watching a Borat segment with somebody from Kazakhstan, and that may be the real test. I won't be at all surprised if history judges the character harshly. I'm still going to see the movie, though. Because I'm a monster.</div>
