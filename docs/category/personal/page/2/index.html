                    <p>[video width=&quot;694&quot; height=&quot;516&quot; mp4=&quot;/static/2020/07/Dad-on-Accent-Lighting_mono.mp4&quot;][/video]</p>
<p>My dad had a law degree, but he never used it much. He worked demolition, then construction, then found a niche installing lighting for art. He liked playing guitar and trading stories at the gym. And he loved the video production classes he took at the Arlington Career Center. He managed to land a gig making an instructional video or two for the FDA. But video was mostly an expensive new hobby that arrived just in time for the empty nest left by his kids going to college.</p>
<p>He was never very good at it, to be honest. He didn't have much photographic sensibility. Ironically, he failed to light many of his shots.&nbsp; And he could never remember how to get things done in Premiere or Final Cut, instead writing out long lists of instructions for himself (always on graph paper)--a habit I took to be an amusing piece of fuddy duddyism at the time, but now understand to have been among the first creeping tendrils of his dementia.</p>
<p>When he got his diagnosis and had decided to go home to Vermont it was abrupt. He didn't want to bother anyone, I think. My sister and I learned one day that our childhood home had been sold. But I managed to grab some things, including his stacks of DV tapes, and I digitized and uploaded them a few years ago.</p>
<p>I never really went through them until now. There are a lot of shots of books about Congo for the documentary he never finished (our church hosted a journalist who'd fled Mbutu's regime, which got dad intrigued). There's video from his kids' graduations. Video of his buddies' bands. There is a recording of <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y61v4LdguGA&amp;list=PLMX2ad5XvUxCqUj36utCC1qS3Z7masJeL">an entire production by</a> <em>Le Neon,</em> the French theater that opened in the strip mall up the street, whose cast my dad befriended and who would periodically descend upon our tiny house for grown-up parties bursting with Gallic charisma in a way I found terrifying.</p>
<p>And there's some video of him. I wish there was more. Clips that capture his wit, his comic timing, his enthusiasms, his laugh. Or, like here, the depth of intellect and feeling he carried through the world. Let's be frank: this video is not a good way to sell accent lighting. It is not sufficient for that task. But it's both not enough and too much--a glimpse of how much was there, what a ridiculous abundance. He renders the task for which he wrote those words irrelevant, absurd. Dad, you are supposed to be selling lights, not the sublime!</p>
<p>My father was a gentle, beautiful person, and everyone who met him knew it. It is tempting, sometimes, to succumb to the bitter sense that his gifts were wasted, especially after watching his disease slowly cheat him of them these last seven years. But of course they weren't wasted. I just wish those of us who got to witness them had more company.</p>
<p>Goodbye, dad. We love you. We miss you. We have missed you. We will always miss you.</p>

                    <p>I'm waiting for Windows to finish installing some IE8 debugging software, so perhaps now is a good time to take a breath, open Wordpress and note that <em>I am not dead</em>.&nbsp; I'm just busy.&nbsp; We're perilously close to a major launch on the Subsidyscope project.&nbsp; At the same time, Clay's taken a month off to get married (see also: <a class="reference external" href="http://twitpic.com/igdmm">awww</a>), leaving me to mind the store at Sunlight in his absence.&nbsp; It's flattering and exciting, but hasn't left a lot of time for bloggy diversions.</p>
<p>But to catch you up briefly: I bought a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/ASUS-1005HA-PU1X-BK-10-1-Inch-Black-Netbook/dp/B002DYIXMI/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=electronics&amp;qid=1253554452&amp;sr=8-1">netbook</a>; Emily and I remain enthralled by <a class="reference external" href="/2009/08/23/despite-the-following-i-assure-you-that-i-am-an-adult-man/">Avatar</a>; Halloween preparation is picking up speed*; I am in perpetually-worse shape; Emily's cat is officially back in Philadelphia as of this morning, and her brother is in DC; and I still can't <a class="reference external" href="/2009/09/10/making-redskins-radio-usably-portable/">reliably listen to the football game</a> from the bus.</p>
<p>The next month is going to include a bunch of travel (Boston! Vermont!) and hopefully a slight becalming of my work life.&nbsp; And if that happens, perhaps I'll write more here!&nbsp; I do miss it, and appreciate those of you who have bothered to keep my humble blog in your RSS reader.</p>

<p>The process is going pretty well.&nbsp; We're using <a class="reference external" href="http://www.scarefx.com/project_coffin.html">these plans</a>, and while the quoted $25 cost is pretty optimistic, it <em>is</em> relatively affordable as these things go.&nbsp; At this point we've got the boards completely cut; we could assemble it immediately if we wanted.</p>
<p>First, though, I'd like to distress the wood.&nbsp; There are a lot of techniques for doing this, and we've tried several of them on scraps left from the cutting.&nbsp; I'd like to produce an impossibly-weathered sort of gray plank.&nbsp; The internet says the lye in oven cleaner ought to manage this, but so far it seems to have done nothing -- maybe we have the wrong oven cleaner, or perhaps the board's pressure-treated nature is interfering with the deadly chemical reaction.&nbsp; Emily found a method involving vinegar and steel wool, and claims that it shows promise (I remain skeptical).</p>
<p>The only methods that have proven to work are more physical in nature.&nbsp; First, the wire brush: using a drill and an appropriate abrasive wheel allows one to scrape away the weaker portions of&nbsp; the wood's surface, leaving raised ridges and producing a more fibrous, soft sort of finish.&nbsp; It looks good.</p>
<p>The other method is to char the surface with a propane torch.&nbsp; It doesn't produce the gray color I wanted, but the effect is sort of cool, particularly when applied after the wire brush.</p>
<p>Both techniques are fairly labor-intensive, though (particularly the brushing when using only a hand drill).&nbsp; If anyone has access to an angle grinder or feels like joining me in my garage for some beer, fire and power tools, drop me a line.</p>

                    <p>I've accidentally run current backward through some delicate electronics, gone through a staggering number of voltage regulators and flat-out melted a solenoid, but my Artomatic project seems to be working! There is, of course, still a chance that some hardware aspect of the thing will fail. Or that there's a hidden software bug that will prevent it from rebooting on schedule. Or that I'll screw something up when I try to move the log files to a nonvolatile disk location. But for now I'm feeling pretty good about it! If you're by the Navy Yard Metro in the next month, you should drop by, see some art and ring some bells.</p>
<p>The Artomatic website makes it unfortunately difficult to find when the damn event will actually be open. But the info can be found in <a class="reference external" href="http://artomatic.org/node/4976">this press release</a>. The key details:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>You can find a map of the location <a class="reference external" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=CSWJHjvshw4KFdc0UQIdn_do-yFJ05RY2kIyxA&amp;q=artomatic&amp;sll=38.881137,-77.0065&amp;sspn=0.011075,0.023797&amp;gl=us&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ei=bEIUStDsEJ-wiwOsxuT_Aw&amp;cd=3&amp;cid=38876394,-77006946,13824474862365011346&amp;li=lmd&amp;ll=38.878272,-77.00695&amp;spn=0.011075,0.023797&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=A">here</a> — Artomatic is in the same building as the Navy Yard Metro entrance that's closest to the ballpark. My piece is on the fourth floor.</p>
<p><strong>OH YEAH:</strong> For those interested, the project's software is <a class="reference external" href="http://github.com/sbma44/artomatic/tree/master">all on GitHub</a>. If you're wandering in from Google in an effort to figure out how to get Python working on the Fonera with serial and network capabilities, this would be a good place to start.</p>

<p>Based on only my sketchy verbal instructions, my dad whipped two of these up in astoundingly little time as I watched dumbly. He also fed me dinner! It was an impressive performance all around, and I'm very grateful. This thing's about 3' tall, and it's what my finished piece will sit upon for display. It'll be draped in cloth, though, so this is hopefully the last time you'll see it.</p>
<p>In less positive news:</p>
<p><img alt="stolen wheel" class="center" src="/static/2009/05/11/stolen_wheel-20090511-103517.png" /></p>
<p>Upon getting back to the Metro last night I found my rear wheel had been stolen. My current run of bad bike-luck is now impressively long (for those keeping score, the last month has gone flat, flat, flat, flat, wheel, flat, brake cable, shifter cable, trued replacement wheel, stolen other wheel). I suppose I can't complain too much — this Jamis served me very well and with very few problems for the past 3.5 years (ever since my <a class="reference external" href="http://www.zunta.org/blog/archives/2005/02/16/loot/">lovely last bike</a> was <a class="reference external" href="http://www.zunta.org/blog/archives/2005/10/09/post_2/">stolen</a> from out in front of Logan Hardware). Karmically, I'm doing okay.</p>
<p>But this is still infuriating. The return on a stolen bike wheel is miniscule — the person who took this probably got less than 5% of the retail cost of the components that I'll now have to rebuy. Worse, I know it's my fault for being rushed and parking it at a Metro and forgetting my cable. And, well, it just sucks. I try to take these things in stride, but it takes me a couple of days to let go of the anger that being victimized provokes. Last night's dreams featured some pretty elaborate bicycle-themed revenge fantasies.</p>

                    <p>I've been a little worn down all day. Yesterday <a class="reference external" href="http://www.grammarpolice.net">Kriston</a> and I set out to begin a batch of homebrewed wheat beer. But we did a bad job of estimating times and got a late start, and the result was a brewing operation that lasted until 3AM.</p>
<p>It seems to have gone fine, though. It wasn't yet bubbling by the time I left for work, but of course that was only a horrifically small number of hours since it went into the fermenter. By the time I got home from work it was bubbling away happily:</p>
<p>This is a marked improvement from my <a class="reference external" href="http://internetfoodassociation.com/2009/02/09/even-more-unwanted-foam/">last brewing attempt</a>, which spewed foam all over the goddamn place. This time the friendly folks at the Philly homebrew store gave me some Belgian Wyeast liquid yeast, and it seems to be a bit better behaved than True Brew's relatively vigorous stuff.</p>

                    <p>Want to hear me say &quot;UHHH&quot; several hundred times? Here, this should scratch that itch:</p>
<p>I can't help cringing when I watch this, but I really did have a good time, and I'm grateful for being given the opportunity to represent Sunlight.</p>
<p><em>Washington Journal</em> is an impressively high-volume operation — you're led into the studio and then it's almost immediately time to go. It's a little bit disorienting. The fact that the studio turns out to be exactly on the other side of wall on which the green room monitors are located doesn't help matters. <em>It's like a video window, man!</em> I appreciated the coffee and the chocolate croissant, but it seems like an even nicer thing to do for your guests would be to minimize the mind-bending spatial revelations that you expose them to.</p>
<p>I can't say I'm immensely pleased with my performance during the first half of the show, but things did improve as we got further in and moved on to topics that I've been working on for more than a couple of days (this recovery.gov stuff has been kind of sudden). By the twenty minute mark I was still acting weird and stilted, but not much more so than I do in real life. If I get another chance to do this maybe I'll find a way to speak fluidly for more than six syllables at a time — that's the dream, anyway.</p>
<p>I wish I had more amusing thoughts to share about the experience, but at the time I was too terrified to make many wry observations. Besides, I'm pretty sure that everyone who works in D.C. winds up on Washington Journal eventually — when I signed my name in the guestbook (marking myself as a total n00b, no doubt), I wasn't at all surprised to see the name of a friend-of-friends that I run into at parties a couple of lines above my own. What I'm trying to say is that you'll no doubt have a chance to have this experience yourself if you you have both a job in Washington and a collared shirt.</p>
<p>Oh yeah! They gave me a coffee mug! This small piece of proof (the above clip could of course be entirely computer-generated and for all I know is) is now my most prized media-appearance-related mug. Previously this position was held by the mug I received for my appearance at the NBC4 Health &amp; Fitness Expo, which involved walking in and helping myself to a complimentary mug. I think someone was getting crowd shots, though, so it totally counts.</p>

                    <p>My new wheel is working great — more than 24 hours without a flat! — but on my way to work this morning something happened to my front brake cable. I can still engage the break, but it doesn't disengage. My current theory is that the cable half-popped somewhere in its housing, maintaining the connection but providing a tangled wire mess that prevents proper braking (I have to pry the levers apart by hand). Back to the Bike Rack! The guys there are going to think I have the cyclist version of Munchausen by Proxy.</p>

                    <p>Hello! I didn't spend last night in a hotel. This has become a sufficiently unusual occurrence that I thought I should mention it.</p>
<p>Not that I'm trying to present myself as a cosmopolitan traveler, mind you. My destinations have included Houston and Indianapolis, and next weekend I'll be in Atlanta. These are places which don't qualify as America's armpits, exactly — what are we, Goro? — but they could fairly be called the sweaty small of our great nation's back.</p>
<p>There's something to recommend each of them, though, and there was a lot to recommend Houston in particular. First, my sister lives there, and she's very charming. Beth works for the nonprofit that manages <a class="reference external" href="http://www.orangeshow.org/orange.html">The Orange Show</a> and the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.beercanhouse.org/">Beer Can House</a> (both of which are very cool), and her boyfriend Jeremy is in the business of making <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethylene_oxide">deadly, spider-attracting chemicals</a>. <a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ethorson/3349729432/">The two of them</a> have an extremely pleasant house in the part of Houston near the highway, which is to say I have no idea where they live. It's right by a taco truck called Elena's II, though, which is across the street from a taco truck called Elena's III. I can vouch for Elena's II — that was some of the best food I've had in recent memory. Elena's III could be a crapshoot for all I know.</p>
<p>That was the first thing that Emily and I realized about Houston: the food's great. We ate Mexican food at every possible opportunity and I don't think we were ever disappointed. Real barbacoa was a revelation.</p>
<p>The drinking was good, too. Bought from the supermarket, Shiner and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ethorson/3349729488/">Lone Star</a> are unremarkable beers. But placed into their proper context — say, an ice house yard filled with Sunday sun, kids shooting basketball, dogs stealing food and friendly gentlemen who genially critique visiting Yankees' horseshoe skills while not-very-discreetly smoking joints at the corner picnic table — they become the best beers you're ever going to taste.</p>
<p>Oh! We also went to the rodeo. The attached fair and livestock show are pretty much what you'd expect, except with more places selling multi-foot sausages (available with stick or without!). The actual rodeo, though, was unexpectedly great. Perhaps on repeat visits the novelty would wear off — I can imagine that the casual sexism with which the announcers discussed each barrel-riding cowgirl's beauty might start to rankle — but the actual events were thrilling and proceeded in quick succession. There's a lot to be said for watching a grown man leap from a horse onto a steer and wrestle it to the ground, and even more to be said for watching it twelve times in a row. Since then I have been surprised to find myself watching professional bullriding on television, and reading with credulous interest accounts of how the sport isn't actually cruel at all. That's how quickly this sport (see? I'm calling it a sport) can get its hooks into you.</p>
<p>But none of the proper rodeo events could compete with the Calf Scramble. For the uninitiated, this is an event in which our human society pits its children against those of the cows. Dozens of fresh-faced Future Farmers of America race toward a smaller crowd of confused, slightly bored calves and attempt to cajole them into submission. If you manage to subdue one of the calves you'll be presented with a certificate good for the future purchase of such an animal, which you'll then presumably raise. Who knows? With hard work and a little luck, in a few years you might be one of the cowboys over at the Ag Expo applying can after can of hairspray to a bull.</p>
<p>The charming part of the scramble is how simultaneously overmatched and excited the kids are. Emily and I watched a post-game interview with an ecstatic and disheveled young woman who had just won a calf, and no sir, she didn't mind at all that it had stepped on her head, in fact she didn't even remember that part!</p>
<p>Here's some video of the 2005 Houston Rodeo calf scramble. Unfortunately the professional rodeo videographers who shot it seem to have been intent on playing up the desperate athletic conflict of the thing. And who can blame them? They spend most of their time filming flinty cowboys as they casually, mercilessly assert their dominance over the bovine world. But most of the calf scramble is much more hapless than that, and considerably more endearing. If you had to pick a single representative image of the proceedings it would be of a girl holding on to a calf's tail in the corner of the arena, both of them confused about what should happen next.</p>
<p>From Houston we went to Galveston, then to Austin via Lockhart. We had some <a class="reference external" href="http://www.gaidosofgalveston.com/restaraunts.html">great seafood</a> in Galveston and stayed in a fancy hotel — it was nice! — but the town's clearly still getting itself together from the hurricane's aftermath. Austin was Austin — you know it's great. Suspiciously great, in fact, like all college towns. Oh, and everything <a class="reference external" href="http://grammarpolice.net">Kriston</a> has said about barbecue in Lockhart is correct, and perhaps even understated. <a class="reference external" href="http://www.kreuzmarket.com/index.shtml">Kreuz Market</a> is a monastery, and imposes vows of abstinence from sauce and forks upon visitors as soon as they walk through the door. When your server turns and reaches into the fire-flecked pit behind him to retrieve some brisket, it's easy to imagine that he's actually reaching into the underworld — and is that really beef? It seems too tender. What sort of barbecue sect is this, anyway? It's all too delicious to fight, though. Accept your damnation, and be sure to try the sauerkraut.</p>
<p>And that was about it for Texas. I spent the past few days in Indianapolis at the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ire.org/training/conference/indy09/">Computer Assisted Reporting Conference</a>. The conference was good: it was fun to be told embarrassing stories about my new coworkers, and to observe the extent to which journalists everywhere seem to share the same talents and affectations — many of the same ones that I suffer from and/or aspire to. These were good people, and I felt right at home.</p>
<p>Indianapolis, though... well, I don't know. They've got some creepy, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ire.org/training/conference/indy09/">Masonic-looking monuments</a>, which makes me think there may be some pretty good secret conspiracies going on. But the downtown is incredibly free of personality; the closest thing I observed to local color was an installation of the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.360indianapolis.com/Restaurants/WeberGrillRestaurant.html">Weber Grill chain restaurant</a>. On the plus side, the tapwater seemed to be extremely soft, so any travelers who are more worried about limestone scale or excessive shampooing times than about access to culinary and cultural options would do well to give Indianapolis a look.</p>
<p>In five days: Atlanta. I've been before and it was okay, although it was hard to shake the feeling that Ted Turner was singlehandedly responsible for about 90% of the city. Maybe this time will be different; I'll report back.</p>

                    <p>Well, as of yesterday I'm twenty-nine. It's terrible! Or in theory it is, anyway. I actually had an extremely nice weekend: Emily came down from Philly; we ate at Corduroy; cooked a delicious Valentine's Day meal with Matt and Sara; saw <em>The Wrestler</em>; had Szechuan hot pot with Ezra, Annie, Ethan, Kay, Ben and Amanda, and then went out for drinks with folks on Sunday. Aside from a minor fiasco involving finding a bar that wasn't so packed as to be unusable — seriously, space in DC drinking establishments is now at such a premium that booking a band has to be considered a hostile act perpetrated against the patrontariat — it was a great way to spend a birthday. Oh! And along the way I got an <a class="reference external" href="https://buy.garmin.com/shop/shop.do?pID=349">exciting new electronic fitness</a> gizmo, a book about werewolves and some custom-made oatmeal. Not too shabby.</p>
<p>At the moment I'm sitting at home, <a class="reference external" href="http://flickr.com/photos/sbma44/3284658377/">preparing</a> for an <a class="reference external" href="http://dclug.tux.org/dclug_meetings.html">Arduino-related presentation</a> I'll be contributing to [STRIKEOUT:tomorrow] on Wednesday (not the one with Alberto; that's on the 28th), listening to <a class="reference external" href="http://moraladventure.blogspot.com/2009/02/world-dances-on-dd.html">the new Dan Deacon</a> (which is beautiful) and playing <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance_Wars_Dual_Strike">Advance Wars</a>. It's pretty pleasant! But it also seems like the sort of opportunity I ought to use for writing things here.</p>
<p>I've been terrible about this, I realize. I also realize that blogged resolutions to change are stupid. But in my experience it's only possible to maintain (relative) prolificacy if I force myself into the habit — after that first push things get easier. Besides, it was mostly the process of becoming oriented to my new gig over at Sunlight that's left me too busy and distracted to do much else. But I've got some help now, and things have calmed down a bit, so yeah: blogging!</p>
<p>So, uh... I guess that still leaves this post a little low on content, huh? Hmm. Has everyone already seen that <em>I'm on a Boat (ft. T-Pain)</em> video?</p>
<p>What can I say? I'm a sucker for profanity and pashmina jokes. And, totally coincidentally, I've recently been aspiring to boat-ridership myself. It's the perfect YouTube storm.</p>
<p>Oh! Also funny: <a class="reference external" href="http://www.avclub.com/articles/eugene-mirman-answers-your-questions-about-sex-lif,23762/">Eugene Mirman</a>. There, that's enough other-people's-content, right? See, I told you I'd be able to get back into the blogging swing of things.</p>

                    <p>I was pretty happy to wake up and see snowflakes falling. I'd already decided to take the day off — a tight deadline had forced me to work an extra week's worth of evenings, plus Saturday and Sunday — so I was committed to sloth irrespective of the weather. Having snow on the ground somehow made the experience of playing hooky seem more legitimate, though, and consequently more restful.</p>
<p>Washingtonians famously tend to freak out about snow. In truth, I think we only do so to the extent necessary to support a more important (and collectively beloved) winter weather meta-activity: complaining about how much everyone else freaks out about snow. I remember Don &amp; Mike doing bits about residents stockpiling bread, milk and toiletpaper as early as their WAVA days, back when the station focused on engendering affection for C&amp;C Music Factory rather than for Jesus. Sure, I believe that area residents don't really know how to drive in winter conditions. But for me and for most other folks around here that belief is much less dearly-held than the broader sentiment that, once flakes start falling, everyone else becomes an idiot.</p>
<p>Whatever the underlying motivation, I'm glad that we overreact to snow, sleet, slush, hail, wintry mix and of course the dread black ice. This city works too hard. It would be nice if we'd drop the rationalizations and simply acknowledge our snow-induced delays as acquiescences to the pagan meteorological gods. Divine injunctions to take it easy are too few and far between. I say that for anything over two inches we officially take the day off. Not because it's hard to get around, but just because. If any tourists look at you askance just mumble something about averting wrath.</p>

                    <p>Non-surprise!: dental insurance remains a complete and utter scam. I'm still waiting on the follow-up phone call, but some mail I got over the weekend has made me think that, for the second time in six months, my dental insurer has decided they aren't responsible for paying for more than a thousand dollars' worth of work that, before the procedure, my dentist assured me they would.</p>
<p>Last time it was because they only pay for dental technologies that are no longer in use — trepanning, internally-administered quicksilver, that sort of thing. This time the procedure was safely archaic — no joke, my molar is now filled with a <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gutta_percha">tree sap discovered in 1842</a> — so I suspect that instead they'll say they're off the hook because I was switching jobs. In fact I was <em>doubly covered</em> for much of the period in question, with two — two! — separate insurance providers supposedly responsible for the care and upkeep of my mouth. There was no point at which I did not have dental coverage. I was awash in dental coverage! And yet...</p>
<p>It turns out that while an individual dental procedure occupies an infinite amount of time when viewed through the lens of subjective experience, when the perspective is shifted to the realm of paperwork even vast swaths of appointments suddenly collapse into single instantaneous points, which are located such that entropy/out-of-pocket-expenses are maximized.</p>
<p>Anyway it's all quite fascinating in a mathematical and ontological sense, but at the same time it's also really goddamn irritating.</p>

                    <p>Hi there! Christmas obligations have ceased, and we're on to the &quot;lying around&quot; phase of the holidays (my favorite part). The Christmas celebrations themselves... well, they went pretty well. I got a tent! Also a Nintendo DS, and a ton of candy, and <em>who knows</em> what delights from Emily (we're still slowly exchanging presents, but I've already gotten a copy of <em>Dune</em> from her, which is pretty awesome).</p>
<p>Exchanging presents with my family was awfully pleasant, too, as was the Grays' Christmas party (now with heated tent!) and having a chance to see old friends. Really, there's only one constituency that inexplicably dropped the ball in its Christmas celebrations: the Jews.</p>
<p>Well, alright, they didn't fall so far short. Black Cat Christmas Eve was <a class="reference external" href="http://www.manifestdensity.net/2008/12/25/christmas_eve_in_the_drunk_tan_1/">unacceptably cheerful</a>, but that's hardly their fault. It was the Christmas movie-watching where the true outrage occurred. Yes, Spencer and Matt joined me to watch <em>The Spirit</em>. But was there subsequent Chinese food to be had? No! They were too full from their preceding visit <em>to a Christmas party</em> to get noodles. For shame, gentlemen. That is not what Jewish Christmas is all about.</p>
<p>Spencer made amends a few days later, though (Matt had left for New York), as we discussed <em>Valkyrie</em> and my flailing bok choy accidentally sent broth spattering all over the restaurant. So I don't think I'll have to report anybody to their childhood rabbi just yet.</p>
<p>Actually, it turns out that I've seen a ton of movies over this break:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>The Spirit:</strong> Pretty bad, and not in a good way.</li>
<li><strong>Valkyrie:</strong> Not bad! But (SPOILER ALERT) it turns out the good guys lose in the end.</li>
<li><strong>No Country For Old Men:</strong> Remains awesome.</li>
<li><strong>Gilda:</strong> Sommer tells me that this is Rita Hayworth's most famous role, and I guess it's the one featured in <em>The Shawshank Redemption</em>. The plot concerns the titular character, who's kind of cruel sociopath, but less so than the two men who form the other points of the movie's love triangle, one of whom owns a cane-sword. Everybody is constantly smoking and being mean and answering questions with questions, which conveys an air of sophistication, apparently. And it all happens against the exotic backdrop of an illegal casino in Buenos Aires, possibly, and the intrigue and excitement that necessarily surround an illicit tungsten cartel. Frankly, that was my biggest complain with the movie: there wasn't nearly enough in it about tungsten. It's a <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tungsten">fascinating element</a>! Anyway, I'm not sure that this was a good movie, exactly, but it was fun to watch, and available to stream from Netflix. Drink every time someone says &quot;Johnny&quot;.</li>
<li><strong>Die Hard 2:</strong> A perennially-underrated (by me) entry in the <em>Die Hard</em> franchise. It's actually pretty good! But it's also now bittersweet, thanks to the failed Fred Thompson candidacy. He's an even better pretend airport administrator than he is a pretend district attorney! It's hard to watch it and avoid thinking about what a fine pretend commander in chief he would've made.</li>
</ul>
<p>Only one other disjointed Christmas occurrence to share: the cleaning of my dad's basement, which comprised his major Christmas gift from his children. A quarter-century of water-damaged crap lay in wait. There were childhood treasures to rescue, dead rats to locate, and huge amounts of toxic dust to inhale. It took some professional help, but we did it. Here's the truck — it isn't yet full in this picture, but it was brimming by the time we called it a day.</p>

                    <p>It has to be said: Black Cat Christmas Eve has fallen off in a pretty serious way. I just got back from it, and yeah, I had a nice time. My friends were there, and beer was there, and unexpected friendly acquaintances were there, and it was pretty good. But the atmosphere was terrible. This was, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.zunta.org/blog/archives/2006/01/02/personal_failur/">I think</a>, the fourth installment of this tradition, but right now I'm worried that we may have to find a new venue for the fifth.</p>
<p>Here's what Black Cat Christmas Eve is supposed to be. First: the only open bar in town. Second: filled with put-upon Jews and self-pitying Christians. Third: silent, except for paid-for instances of &quot;Fairytale of New York&quot; played via the jukebox. Fourth: characterized by furtive smoking — or, if legislation precludes smoking, plenty of uncomfortable introspective pauses.</p>
<p>STRONGLY CONTRAINDICATED: DJs, crowds, and merriment — yet all were in abundance tonight. Extraneous DJ aside, it was like any other night in the Red Room. This probably sounds like it shouldn't be a problem — after all, I like the Red Room! But it felt wrong. I enjoy this tradition because of the atmosphere and the carefully-cultivated and variably-meta sense of self-pity that it fosters. Having a bunch of drunk Irish guys making boisterous toasts undercuts that decisively.</p>
<p>But I suppose I can't really complain. Having a good time while being surrounded by people enjoying themselves is a strange thing to bitch about. It's just that this is the one night every year that I have set aside <em>specifically</em> for the romanticization of lonesomeness. I feel like that's not too much to ask.</p>
<p>Of course, it always comes back to that goddamn Pogues song — that's the whole premise. And if you want an illustration of what the Red Room Christmas Eve is supposed to be versus what it presently is, all you have to do is listen to the original version back-to-back with Stars' horrible cover:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><a class="reference external" href="/2008/12/25/christmas_eve_in_the_drunk_tan_1/The%20Pogues%20-%20Fairytale%20of%20New%20York.mp3">The Pogues – Fairytale of New York</a></div>
<div class="line"><a class="reference external" href="/2008/12/25/christmas_eve_in_the_drunk_tan_1/Stars%20-%20Fairytale%20of%20New%20York.mp3">Stars – Fairytale of New York</a></div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>A BIT TANGENTIAL:</strong> Having just listened to it (after being forced to listen to uptempo non-Pogues songs at the Cat), I feel compelled to point out that <em>by far</em> the most (and arguably only) devastating couplet in &quot;Fairytale of New York&quot; is &quot;I could have been someone / well so could anyone&quot;. The rest is mostly melodrama, to be honest. Still, that's a hell of a sentiment.</p>
<p><strong>ALSO:</strong> Make fun all you want, but Sufjan really brings it when it comes to Christmas music. &quot;<a class="reference external" href="http://hypem.com/search/what%20child%20is%20this%20anyway/1/">What Child Is This Anyway</a>&quot; may be irony-free, but it's also pretty awesome.</p>

<p>Kriston was nice enough to invite me along to the UMD iron pour. If you get a chance to attend a similar gathering, I strongly recommend that you do. It was bitterly cold, so we didn't exactly linger. But the sulfurous stink of burning coal, the sight of underqualified undergrads poking at the fiery slag hole, and the general atmosphere of nervous excitement all combined to satisfyingly deadly effect.</p>

                    <p>Well, past assurances to the contrary, it turns out that I haven't really been blogging here. I will! Soon! But it's my first week on the new job, and I've been busy. Also, I've been tired: I've never been very good at waking up in the morning. At EchoDitto I'd come into work at 10 and leave around 6 or 7 or 8 if I needed to get something done. Sunlight operates on a more normal schedule, and while I've been managing to wake up without major difficulties, I haven't yet gotten this &quot;go home/to bed slightly earlier&quot; thing down yet. So I'm a little exhausted.</p>
<p>Things are going well, though. It's a bit lonesome in my office, but that'll be fixed as soon as I hire some folks (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.transparencyjobs.com/jobs/56/">Here's</a> the job listing for the first position we're hiring for, incidentally. I haven't yet posted the link anywhere else — it's a Manifest Density exclusive!). And as of yesterday I have an enormous whiteboard to keep me company, which is nice.</p>
<p>I've mostly just been getting acclimated: drafting some documents, going to meetings, and finding opportunities to familiarize myself with Sunlight's technology. You know how first weeks go. Everybody's been extremely friendly, and it's really great to have the latitude and time to figure out the right way to solve the problem we're facing.</p>
<p>I do have one complaint, though:</p>

                    <p>I haven't written anything here all week, and didn't write much for a while beforehand. That's because I've been putting off writing this post.</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/510952105/"><img alt="Jason Goad's EchoDitto Poster" class="center" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/206/510952105_4a7ee66e0d.jpg" style="width: 354px; height: 500px;" /></a></p>
<p>Today is my last day at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.echoditto.com">EchoDitto</a>. As you might imagine, it's a bit depressing. Soon I'm going to have to pack up my desk, clean my stuff out of the fridge, and play my last game of foosball as a non-guest. This is, admittedly, all fairly trivial stuff. But I'm the sort of guy who feels wistful about throwing out old CD cases, for god's sake. Change is hard.</p>
<p>Genuinely, objectively awful: the fact that I have to leave my coworkers. I've been incredibly privileged to work with people this kind and smart and funny. I've learned a tremendous amount from them: about business, about running projects, about new technologies, and about leading people. And I've gotten to do it while working with some pretty cool clients: SEIU, Mother Jones and Greenpeace UK all spring to mind; plus I've gotten to contribute, at least peripherally, to efforts on behalf of the Clinton Global Initiative, Seventh Generation and the EFF, among many others.</p>
<p>But it's time to move on — I've felt that way for a little while, to be honest. The sorts of projects you get as a consultant can be a bit homogenous. Billable-hours work can be a drag. And I have to admit: I'm pretty sick of Drupal. I figured that if I was going to keep doing this sort of work, I might go freelance for a bit — even PHP is fun to code when you're in your pajamas. Or maybe I'd wander the earth fighting injustice. I hadn't really decided.</p>
<p>Something came up first, though, and I'm extremely excited about it. As of Monday I'll be working for the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.sunlightfoundation.com">Sunlight Foundation</a>, an organization that I've long admired. I'll be heading up the technical side of their latest project — it's exciting, and daunting, and I can't wait to get started. It'll mean a whole new suite of technologies and challenges; a chance to assemble and lead a team of programmers; and an opportunity to build a tool that — if we do it right — could help people understand some of the ways our government works and how they could be improved. And, importantly, it'll be a chance to learn from a whole new set of brilliant colleagues.</p>
<p>You'll be hearing much more about this from me soon; for now, suffice it to say that I'd love to hear from any talented developers who might be reading (particularly if they know Python) — thomas.j.lee (at) (google's popular email service).</p>
<p>It's going to be strange to leave EchoDitto. <a class="reference external" href="http://www.zunta.org/blog/archives/2005/11/23/decisions/">Three years ago I asked for advice about whether I should come work here</a>. The best advice I got was from Tripp:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">My experience in the tech world is that after awhile it *all* becomes relatively boring. Today's kewl new becomes tommorow's has been. Most of the kewl new is hype and remarketing of the old.</div>
<div class="line">So my advice is to focus on the people. How do you feel about the people you currently work with? If you feel good and you think it will stay that way then stick it out.</div>
<div class="line">Good people can make boring work fun, and after awhile ALL work becomes boring. I say this after 27 years in the booming computer field.</div>
<div class="line">So focus on working with good people.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>He was right. Six months later I wrote this (while <a class="reference external" href="http://www.zunta.org/blog/archives/2006/06/02/pimping_actuall/">shamelessly trawling for hires</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
People use the phrase &quot;it was the best decision I ever made&quot; to describe getting a hair transplant, or buying a boat, or ordering a Cobb salad. So I'd like to avoid joining their idiomatic ranks, but I can't. It just seems so obvious. These are the smartest, coolest, funniest, most talented people I've ever worked with, and the job itself is interesting, varied and rewarding. I look forward to work every day. Okay, every non-hungover day.</blockquote>
<p>I'd be lying if I said I was still quite that giddy on a day-to-day basis. Things have settled down, I've gotten older, and the nature of the business — and the internet — has changed. But the part about the people is still true. I've met a lot of amazing folks because of EchoDitto. Thanks to all of you for letting me count you among my friends.</p>

                    <p>I really can't recommend root canals highly enough. I had my first one on Wednesday; now I think everyone should get one.</p>
<p>Of course, there's a reason for my enthusiasm that may be unique to me. The first part of last week was not good. I had a headache all weekend. At first I blamed this on the fancy Belgian cider I had consumed at fake Thanksgiving; that, and the universe immediately refuting the somewhat Nietzschean theory of hangover evasion that I had explained to Yglesias at drunken length.</p>
<p>But the headache grew, and then started coming in waves, and then the waves stopped having troughs, and it pretty much felt like someone was crushing the side of my skull with an aluminum baseball bat and the moment of impact had been frozen in time. It made for a pretty unproductive week. I hereby apologize for the following tasks and traits that I failed to perform and/or exhibit as a result of my discomfort:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Conference call attentiveness</li>
<li>Abstention from pathetic muttering/angry cursing</li>
<li>Affable rock concert co-attendance</li>
<li>Subway conversation</li>
<li>Cordial greeting of the oh-you're-outside-the-party-smoking variety</li>
<li>Birthday enthusiasm</li>
<li>Eating solid food at normal rates</li>
<li>Web content provision</li>
</ul>
<p>I went to see the dentist pretty soon after this started — the pain seemed to radiate from suspiciously close to the tooth that had been irritatingly sensitive to cold since my <a class="reference external" href="/2008/04/07/untoothsome/">massive filling session</a>. WebMD was, as usual, almost completely useless, but it did get across the point that failure to have tooth pain checked out is a bad idea if you're at all fond of your jaw. The dentist took an x-ray and assured me that she continued to have a high opinion of the work she had done. I said I didn't want to cause a fuss and would try to tough it out. Doubtless I was just a victim of our society's collective neuroticism — I'd probably seen an ad for tooth pain on the subway or something.</p>
<p>But things got worse that evening. Having been told my tooth was fine, I started shopping for candidate diseases on Wikipedia. <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporomandibular_joint_disorder">TMJ</a>? Kinda lame, to be honest, and it didn't really fit the symptoms. But from there I found <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuralgia#Atypical_.28trigeminal.29_neuralgia">atypical trigeminal neuralgia</a> — man, I was sorry to let that one go. I heartily recommend it to any hypochondriacs looking for an especially dire explanation for a headache. It can be difficult to treat and is so frequently misdiagnosed that (Wikipedia claims) it's sometimes called &quot;the suicide disease&quot;. Now we're talking!</p>
<p>Sadly, it turns out that I just had a prosaic infection, and that the pain was coming from the nerve's death throes. When I returned to the dentist the next day to insist on treatment (or at least a prescription for something fun), she referred me to an endodontic specialist a few blocks away. There, a doctor with a very Hispanic name and very midwestern mannerisms quickly diagnosed and treated me. Man! It was great. She was so good and the relief so immediate that I couldn't help developing a little crush on her. The only pain I felt was the prick of the novocaine needle, which — if you've ever flattered yourself by imagining that you're in the 51st percentile or better of population-wide toughness (and pretty much all guys do, pretty much all the time) — is the sort of pain that you really can't complain about.</p>
<p>All in all, it was about a million times better than <a class="reference external" href="http://74.125.45.132/search?q=cache:Uk-PbO8E0yEJ:movering.com/node/529+site:movering.com+root+canal&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1&amp;gl=us">Emily's experience</a>, and although I didn't wind up with any painkillers, I did walk away with an awesome metal instrument for emergency dental self-intervention during Thanksgiving travel (the specific procedure also calls for a butane lighter — I know!).</p>
<p>Anyway, root canals: recommended! Would buy from again.</p>

                    <p>But not really! I've been vague about the scary story contest deadline from the start, saying it was today but not specifying a time. This was by design: obviously some of us might wind up scrambling to finish. I'm no exception, I'm afraid — Halloween party prep has begun in earnest, consuming a lot of the weekend. Although I'm almost done with my story, I'm not there quite yet.</p>
<p>If, on the other hand, you are a responsible person who can meet deadlines, then my hat is off to you. Go submit it! Just visit <a class="reference external" href="http://halloween.manifestdensity.net">halloween.manifestdensity.net</a> — it's a simple little drupal site I stood up on Saturday morning. I realize it probably seems like overkill, but this struck me as the best way to keep things anonymous. Just register for an account. You'll then be able to submit your story and to view and vote on other people's stories. Even if you're not writing anything, I'd still encourage you to head over there and <a class="reference external" href="http://halloween.manifestdensity.net/user/register">create an account</a> so that you can help rate stories. It should only take a second.</p>
<p>Those of you who are fighting the good fight and powering through your tales' conclusions: I'm grateful, and looking forward to reading your stuff. Let's shoot for the end of tomorrow night, okay? That means that ideally everyone who's planning to participate will have submitted some text by Wednesday morning.</p>

<p>So <a class="reference external" href="http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/archives/2008/10/leedn_donuts.php">Dunkin' Donuts is building LEED-certified buildings</a>, huh? With earthworm composting for the waste material? Fascinating. As a longtime veteran of the Donut Wars (Immobile Assault Division), my first instinct is to add this to the tally and see how Dunkin' — the hated foe of me and my fellow partisans — now stacks up against my beloved Krispy Kreme.</p>
<p>Here's the updated pro-Dunkin' list, which I present in the spirit of temperate objectivity:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Ubiquity</li>
<li>Distinctly uncoffeelike coffee (that is still strangely compelling)</li>
<li>Has now broken with the donut industry's rapaciously anti-environmental past, apparently</li>
</ul>
<p>I may be missing a few points. But what is not on this list — what is <em>never</em> on the list — is &quot;excellent donuts&quot;. It's a bit mystifying to me, even after speaking to <a class="reference external" href="http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org">Matt</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://silbatron.com">Michael</a> about it at length. Dunkin' Donuts seems to be this store that Northeasterners like to get coffee from in the morning. It happens to have the word &quot;donut&quot; in its name, and yeah, if you ask for a donut they probably have some in the back.</p>
<p>But — with the exception of the cake donut perverts, who frankly should be rounded up and hospitalized — I've never heard anyone defend Dunkin's donuts on the merits. Stacking the franchise up against Krispy Kreme is therefore bizarre, like saying McDonald's is better than a steakhouse because the latter doesn't keep a plastic slide out front. If you want to make a comparison based on the crucial &quot;has a fun slide&quot; metric, it should be between McDonald's and, say, a waterpark. Or, to bring the analogy home, between Dunkin' Donuts and a real coffeeshop. Instead the Dunkin' bullies choose to pick on poor Krispy Kreme (too busy making excellent donuts to defend itself!), rather than take on the coffeeshops that would surely spell their rhetorical doom.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">But I won't belabor the point. By now I can see that I'm on the wrong side of history (it's something of a family tradition). But those of us who truly love our donuts will keep the faith, and wait patiently for the day when Real Americans are ready to emerge from behind the silence of the glaze curtain and cry <em>Hot Donuts... NOW!</em></div>

<p>I love getting those emails, though. In particular, I've become a frequent recipient of pickup-basketball-scheduling emails among a group of devout young Asian teens &amp; twentysomethings. It was all pretty boring until I started getting updates about their star-crossed mission trip to Kyrgyzstan. Plane delays! Lost luggage! The constant, unshakable faith that God cared deeply about their travel arrangements, and had a good reason for abruptly altering them. It was quite a rollercoaster ride, but everything ultimately worked out: they got their luggage and Kyrgyzstan is, presumably, now a Christian nation.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>Last night, after watching <em>Vampire Show by Alan Ball</em>, some of us got to talking about haircuts. Like &quot;which candy is best?&quot; and &quot;[now-beloved cynical marketing campaign from childhood TV]&quot;, I find this to invariably be a good conversation topic. Pretty much everyone has developed their own dearly-held system of hair maintenance, and they are almost always anxious to explain it in detail. Plus most people will have some self-deprecating anecdotes to share regarding ill-advised haircuts of yore.</p>
<p>But I wasn't just looking to make small talk; I really have been looking for a new place to go. The lady who cuts my hair seems to have recently instituted a fuel surcharge, and that, along with the ever-more-absurd photo of George W. Bush that decorates her work area (and the increasingly uncomfortable discussions about Iraq that go with it), has got me looking for a new head maintenance technician.</p>
<p>It turns out, though, that I exist in an entirely different hair-cutting continuum than the rest of the world. I forget how it came up, but I somehow made it clear that I like to get a shampoo, or at least a rinse, at the end of the haircut. If I don't, tiny bits of hair fall down my shirt and make me itch. When I finished explaining this, everyone looked at me like I'd just casually expressed my personal system for visiting prostitutes.</p>
<p>Apparently this post-haircut-shampoo behavior is shocking: they all place childlike faith in that stupid paper smock, and laugh at the idea of tiny, asbestos-like hair particles causing anyone sort of discomfort. Also, it seems that they get their hair washed immediately upon arriving for their appointments — and by an entirely different person than performs the cutting! Also: they make appointments!</p>
<p>This is all very strange to me. I'm not claiming to be an expert, but I have had my hair cut <em>several</em> times now, and at a variety of different establishments. What Sommer, Emily, Kriston and Charles described is not in keeping with what I've observed at any of them. The female hair maintenance experience I can easily dismiss as irrelevant to my own. But... et tu, Kriston and Charles?</p>
<p>I have no choice but to reluctantly conclude that everyone is crazy but me. They've no doubt been unavoidably warped by the debauched, coastal salon culture that they were unlucky enough to be born into. I think that, without realizing it, I've been getting my hair cut in America — the real America. Places that dare to use the word &quot;barber&quot;, and which honor our troops and their commander in chief — the sorts of places where they keep dirty magazines on top of the coat rack, by God!</p>
<p>I will abandon this foolish attempt to find a new hair-cutter. I didn't realize the chasm that yawned before me. Now I just count myself lucky. And non-itchy.</p>
<p>Incidentally, I hear that post-haircut shampooers are the key voting bloc for this election.</p>

<p>I meant to post this important news earlier, but forgot. Now, shocked back into attention by an outpouring of public interest on Flickr (a comment was left), let me try to make up for lost time.</p>
<p>It has, <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potato_chip#Seasoned_chips">according to Wikipedia</a>, taken us almost a century to get here. But we have arrived at a solution: Carolina-style Utz chips. These are the chips, people.</p>
<p>I realize that regional pride might propel some of you toward Crab Chips. But you're better than that. Crab Chips are a mirthless joke, an exaggerated accent, a story they tell to tourists.</p>
<p>The Carolina-style chip is a precise equation, a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.uni-kassel.de/fb14/stahlbau/tensegrity/tens.html">tensegrity tower</a> constructed from flavored powder: half barbecue, half salt &amp; vinegar. Its elegance cannot be overstated, although that elegance may not be completely apparent if you cram them into your mouth with the same enthusiasm I do.</p>

                    <p>Not a deep thought by any means, but jesus is it embarrassing the extent to which two cups of coffee act to alter my mood. I don't just mean providing pep and vigor; I mean lifting the veil from my eyes, restoring my hope for the future and engagement with the present, and generally making me into what I flatter myself to say is at least a semi-tolerable human being.</p>
<p>Whatever handicaps an adolescence spent playing Starfox and going to debate tournaments may have saddled me with, the experience at least shielded me from some dangerously cool compounds, and for that I should probably be grateful.

<p>I've been to <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goshen_Scout_Reservation">Goshen</a> many times. My troop (and Mike's) was 647 — the fightin' 647th! — and every summer most of us would head to camp Bowman. Sitting on land originally donated by the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merriweather_Post">Post family</a>, Bowman is one of several camps surrounding Lake Merriweather on the Goshen reservation. And, if I may say so, it's the baddest-ass of them.</p>
<p>The point of all of the camps is to aid in rapid merit-badge accumulation. Earning these badges is a worthwhile pursuit since it lets you gain rank, which affords you the opportunity to boss around little kids. Normally the process involves performing some tedious task in isolation (a week's worth of pullups; wandering around a field with a compass) and then going to the home of a stranger you sort of know from church. He's all pissed off because you couldn't find his house and are late, and anyway he only signed up for this because he had to to help his own kid earn the badge. But eventually you have an awkward conversation about citizenship, he signs something, and a few weeks later your mom sews a new badge onto a sash that evokes dueling senses of embarrassment and pride.</p>
<p>The process for earning badges at Scout camp is very different. On the first day you go to each of the various stations: Orienteering! Pioneering! Aquatics! Archery! Riflery! Shotgun! Counterterrorism! Well, alright, not counterterrorism. But there are a number of awesome things that you can sign up for. And if at the end of the week you've managed not to shoot anybody or drown, you're rewarded with a pile of badges — that, and a disturbing eagerness for society's collapse, thanks to a newly-acquired suspicion that you'd excel in the state of nature (presumably on the strength of your ability to tie a proper bowline).</p>
<p>But this can be said of all the camps surrounding the lake. Bowman differentiates itself: its attendees are counted on to work together as patrols to prepare their own meals, maintain their campsites and generally do their best to forestall the descent into savagery that will inevitably have occurred by week's end.</p>
<p>A typical dinner involves picking up ingredients from the central commissary, laboriously preparing them over an open wood fire, then changing into a filthy uniform prior to sitting down to a half hour of picking specs of ash out of inedible mush. Sorrow-drowning is accomplished via powdered fruit punch mixed beyond the point of supersaturation, such that muddy pockets of crystalline sugar whirl around your mouth, barely noticeable under the burning tang of the, um, Tang. There are adult leaders present at these meals, but they typically abstain from scout-prepared food. Instead they subsist on staples purloined from the campsite's collective stores at the week's start (&quot;Almond butter? No, you're right, campers, no one would want to eat <em>that</em>...&quot;); and, in my experience, packets of Taco Bell hot sauce that they wisely smuggled in. The situation is about as dire as you'd expect.</p>
<p>The menu was usually the same from year to year, so I know exactly what caused this food poisoning: the foil packets. These hamburger concoctions were popularly referred to as &quot;Davey Crocketts&quot; in what I can only assume is a grisly reference to the Alamo. Consisting of ground beef and vegetables wrapped in aluminum foil and buried in the fire, they were a highlight of the week. Not because they were particularly good — a lump of unseasoned beef and half-cooked potatoes is not a taste sensation — but because there was no tedious cleanup required (washing dishes without running water turns out to be a huge pain in the ass). I have very little trouble believing that a ton of campers got sick from eating these half-assed culinary creations. It's a wonder it doesn't happen more often, in fact.</p>
<p>I myself got very sick one year at Goshen. Not from food, though — I think it was from inhaling some lake water. But man, I was <em>really</em> sick. Sick enough, in fact, that I was relocated to Camp Post, the administrative facility. I spent the week in bed, but I don't remember much of it. I remember that my breath was sulfurous, which seemed like a bad sign. And I remember that there was a cooler from which patients could help themselves to as many Flintstones sherbet popsicles as they'd like — being afforded this kindness seemed like a <em>very</em> bad sign. I spent my waking hours reading yellowed Casper the Ghost and Richie Rich comics and being visited by my troop's adult leaders, who, with their knee socks and Smokey-the-Bear-hats in hand, looked almost as somber as they did ridiculous.</p>
<p>But at the end of the week my parents picked me up, took me to the beach and after a night spent on the bathroom floor I was fine. I hope the scouts who got sick this summer fare as well, or at least that the quality of the comics on offer has improved.</p>
<p><strong>ALSO:</strong> The Nabob reminds me that he wrote a <a class="reference external" href="http://pygmalioninablanket.blogspot.com/2005/08/f-troop.html">similar post</a> almost exactly three years ago. Except as you might imagine his life-and-death BSA experiences had more to do with exploding shrapnel and flying axe heads than tiny, microscopic germs freemasons run the country!</p>

                    <p>Alright internet, I need theories. We have a problem at work: it's our dishwasher. It's a relatively recent acquisition — one of those miniature units that feel dainty and ridiculous, but which are quite useful for taming the tower of coffee mugs and soiled tupperware that would otherwise teeter over the sink. For that, it's great.</p>
<p>The problem is that it smells. Not while operating, but when its wash cycle is complete, everything inside of it is suffused with a sickening floral scent. Not <em>really</em> floral, mind you — I mean bad fake floral, and with a distinct note of machine oil underneath it. It's pretty unpleasant. I've had to throw out more than one serving of food after forgetting to re-rinse the container I put it in. I once found my eyes watering from it as I tried to eat a mug full of oatmeal.</p>
<p>I thought it was the fancy-pants detergent capsules we were using, but after switching brands that suspect has been ruled out. The smell persists.</p>
<p>So here's the mystery: what the hell could it be? And how do I get rid of it?</p>
<p>Oh, and a dead body was found next to the dishwasher in a puddle of water BUT THE ROOM WAS LOCKED. But I don't think that's necessarily related.</p>

                    <p>It turns out that I'm not a very good gambler. I've already learned this during my still-brief career as a blackjack player — once at Foxwood's, again in New Orleans. In between those trips Atlantic City had neglected to reinforce the lesson, but yesterday it corrected the oversight. Ficke and I had driven there after an idyllic beach weekend — the girls, seemingly blind to the sophisticated glamour of AC, opted to head directly home in the other car. I should've known my luck was bad after five-putting during our pre-departure round of mini-golf. At the time I'd simply chalked it up to the robot spider guarding the hole, but now I see that my problem was more metaphysical.</p>
<p>It was hardly a catastrophe*, but the fumbling, vacant dealers did collect our money with startling speed despite spending most of their time staring hopelessly into the space over our heads. That was the worst part: seeing so many good cards wasted on those for whom they could produce no joy. I would've thought that the place's delightful wild-west theme would keep the employees more cheerful. Maybe for them the mild disappointment Matt and I felt at the lack of period costumes has grown into a poisonous cancer that eats them away from the inside. I bet it's nothing that some leather fringe and a fake gunfight scheduled on the quarter-hour couldn't cure.</p>
<p>* Thanks in part to the casinos' exorbitant ATM fees. Am I crazy to think this is a bad decision on their part? Cutting down that $4.50 charge seems likely to make them a hell of a lot more money over the long run.</p>

We helped sort books for the library's upcoming sale; we strolled through an enjoyably awful craft fair; we had drinks with Emily's high school friends in a bar where they'd carved their initials years ago (a rite of passage for the town's kids). That, plus barbecues, fireworks, beer, and the generous hospitality of Emily's family all made for a pretty great trip.</p>
<p>Of course there was <a class="reference external" href="http://movering.com/yogaball">Yogaball</a>, too — now potentially rebranded as CazBall (comma-rock-the) for marketing purposes. Sadly, I felt as though I had lost a step this year. The ravages of age, perhaps, or maybe just a lack of Yogaball focus. Either way, remedies must be sought. If Dana Torres can qualify for the Olympics surely I can find a way to hit an enormous rubber ball around the lawn in a more competitive manner.</p>
<p>The weekend's other novel activity was <a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ethorson/2641509641/">Rock Band</a>, which Emily's sister Kjerstin somehow convinced her dad to purchase on the spur of the moment.

So I'll just second the <a class="reference external" href="http://philadelphiabrewing.com/">Philadelphia Brewing Company</a> tour: it's free and fascinating, and, as you might imagine, comes with beer. Their Kenzinger is so embarrassingly good that I'm thinking seriously about how to get a case down to DC.</p>
<p>Naturally, though, all the talk about mash tuns and wort got me thinking about giving homebrewing a try. I know, I know: it's not a money saver. It'll smell. My beer will be just okay, and my friends will quickly get sick of drinking it. But it sounds fun! And I have a garage, which should help contain the unpleasantness. Besides, at the hipster flea market Emily and I bought <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/product/0882669400/?tag=unrequitednar-20&amp;linkCode=asn&amp;creativeASIN=0882669400">this book</a> (rescued from among piles of ironic VHS tapes, ironic video game accessories, and ironic Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles merchanise). So really, what choice do I have?</p>
<p>But I could use some advice, o people of the internet. I've assisted a friend with siphoning and bottling before, but that was in the distant past. More recently I had a look at some of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.monkeysee.com/hoptech">these videos</a> and found myself mostly-convinced by the claims associated with the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.hoptech.com/cart/cart.php?target=product&amp;product_id=16133&amp;category_id=3">beginner's kit</a> that they're pitching. Anybody have any other sage wisdom for me?</p>

<p>Matt <a class="reference external" href="http://matthewyglesias.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/06/segway_boom.php">mentioned electric bikes</a> in passing yesterday; as it happens, Hack-a-day had a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.hackaday.com/2008/06/16/electric-recumbent-bicycles/">roundup of electric recumbent projects the same day</a>.</p>
<p>I can't say that I really want an electric bike — they tend to look dumb, and are heavy besides. And I just don't need one, frankly — my legs are more efficient, require less expensive upkeep and are filled with fewer toxic chemicals than EV bikes.</p>
<p>But I do occasionally daydream about a bike with regenerative braking. Partly this is stupid: if you're paying for a drivetrain and motor you might as well go whole-hog and build a complete electric bike. But it's at least a little bit defensible: by designing a system solely meant to capture energy and then release it as a from-a-dead-start acceleration boost, you may be able to lower the requirements for the motor. Certainly your energy-storage requirements would be diminished — no bulky batteries! An array of (admittedly expensive) <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultracapacitor">ultracapacitors</a> could likely do the trick.</p>
<p>Some <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ativsolutions.com/cblog/index.php?/archives/24-Regenerative-Braking.html">actual EV bike manufacturers</a> have crunched the numbers on regenerative braking and concluded that it's a bad deal. But they did so assuming a chemical battery; ultracaps don't have the same slow-recharge limitations, and are considerably more efficient besides.</p>
<p>It may seem like a pretty trivial thing, but I think this could actually make a big difference for cyclists' comfort and safety. When you've been biking for a while you begin to appreciate just how precious momentum is, and how irritating it is to be forced to abandon it due to a motorist's trepidation or inattention. This leads to a lot dangerous behavior — when observing a stop sign comes at the cost of sweat and burning muscles rather than a penny's worth of gasoline, it's tempting to try to make sure things are safe enough and then proceed without pausing. If I could get even half of my momentum back after being forced to stop I'd be a lot happier about pulling the brake lever. It'd let me avoid downshifting when I stop, too.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> The Halfbakery folks <a class="reference external" href="http://www.halfbakery.com/idea/Regenerative_20Brake_20Bike">considered the same idea</a> a while ago using mechanical systems — hydraulic, pneumatic and spring-based. It sounds sort of promising! It's a bit more dangerous than an electric system, but would probably be somewhat cheaper and much more efficient. Unfortunately I know basically nothing about mechanical engineering, so there's not much more I can say about these systems besides noting that they sound cool.</p>

                    <p>I'm in the market for a sport.</p>
<p>It used to be that I stayed in pretty good shape by going to the gym a hell of a lot. In college I'd make it four or five days a week — an undergraduate schedule and a lack of real hobbies besides binge drinking made this relatively easy. But as I've gotten older I've been spending more and more of my time sick*, traveling, tired, working late or complaining about my knees. My post-work gym attendance has fallen off to about once a week (generously), and I'm increasingly unable to fool myself into thinking this will change.</p>
<p>Charles' boxing and yoga adventures have been an inspiration, too, and I think he's right when he says that I need to change up my routine. My short term goal is to find something I can do outside on weekends that'll actually get my heart rate up.</p>
<p>My longer term goal is more important, though: I want to find an activity that puts me on the path to one day being able to play the crazy old coot: the sinewy codger whose tanned hide hangs off his shoulders like a chieftain's furs, and who takes no greater pleasure in life than embarrassing the callow, pudgy fratboys who show up at his mountain/river/field, unaware that they are about to witness geriatric feats of strength and finesse.</p>
<p>It's ambitious, I know. But I think it's doable. My first thoughts are rock climbing and kayaking. I'm terrible at climbing, but know I enjoy it. I've done a lot of whitewater stuff, but never kayaking. The former seems a little cheaper, but right now I'm leaning toward the latter. Although the Potomac is disgusting, and climbing will probably lead to a more satisfyingly leathery payoff. So it's tough to say.</p>
<p>Anyway, I'd be glad to hear any suggestions from you, good people of the internet. All I know is that I don't want to be one of the weird old guys at the Y** who compete in endless handball ladders.</p>
<p>* This includes now. Yes, I'm sick again.</p>
<p>** Ask me sometime about the guy who either has Tourette's or listens to too much WTEM</p>

                    <p>First things first: the City Veins were really, really great on Friday, and if you missed them I'm sorry. Their set seemed a little short and was definitely early, but man was it great. Special guest stars Kriston, Tim-who-I-don't-know, and Tom from These United States (henceforth: Tom<sub>TUS</sub>) added a new dimension to songs that by now I know pretty well. Having heard this band start as a four-piece then refactor their sound and songs when Adam left, it was interesting to hear them return to a surplus of manpower. Interesting and nice!</p>
<p>I seem to have lost my camera and these days Emily's mostly spends its time making deeply pathetic whirring sounds, but friend-of-the-band dotslinesandpolygons took some <a class="reference external" href="http://flickr.com/photos/dotslinesandpolygons/sets/72157605507879155/">great photos</a>. More to the point, go <a class="reference external" href="http://www.thecityveins.com/blog/">buy their CD</a>, why don't ya?</p>
<p>Now, to the boringly personal: I'm kind of surprised to find myself blogging right now rather than, say dead. Or traveling — the former would have been because of the latter. Because holy god, have I done a lot of it recently.</p>
<p>DC to Kitty Hawk for beach. Kitty Hawk to DC. DC to Sonoma for Jeff and Marie's wedding. Sonoma to DC. DC to San Francisco for work. San Francisco to DC. DC to Philadelphia. Philly to DC.</p>
<p>All of that happened over the course of the last <em>two weeks</em>, and there hasn't been more than 36 continuous hours spent in DC during it. Particular highlights included ten hours spent on an already-two-hours-delayed plane to SFO and a three hour trip back from Dulles right before the show on Friday.</p>
<p>Of course all of these trips were made in order to a) get drunk and have great meals with people dear to me or b) meet with interesting clients in a city with fantastic burritos. So I suppose I can't complain (the preceding notwithstanding). But holy hell am I glad that, aside from a Thursday meeting in NYC, the only travel I currently have planned will occur via bicycle.</p>

I seem to have lost my camera somewhere between DC and the beach — it sufficiently close to death that I can't say I'm too broken up about it — but while I wish I could supplement them, the pictures Emily took are more than enough to convey just how beautiful the wedding was.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.jeffnye.org/wedding/2008/06/survive_wedding_check.php">Marie and Jeff</a> rented a gorgeous house in the middle of a bunch of vineyards in the middle of wine country in the middle of a state that's so beautiful it seems like it must be cheating. There were a number of high notes: driving down the coast in a rented convertible; lots of delicious food, wine and beer; hours spent playing an inscrutable German board game; Jon stripping down and jumping in the pool near the end of the reception. Arguably more importantly, the bride and groom are great for each other, and have been for a while now. They seemed to actually enjoy the wedding while simultaneously making sure that their guests did, too, which seemed like a pretty impressive accomplishment.</p>
<p>All in all: a huge success. Way to go, guys.</p>

                    <p>Some of you may have noticed that I updated my Facebook profile this morning in various ways, including the addition of an embarrassingly MySpacey profile photo (dig that soulful staring into space). Please note! I'm still not using that damn platform. I was mostly just trying to figure out how to put a note on my profile stating that I don't really use FB, and that folks should try contacting me elsewhere. Yes, I could just delete my account. But without a Facebook account many people cease to realize you exist, making detainment in secret government prisons all but certain.</p>
<p>Anyway, back to my attempts to add a note to my profile: they ended in abject failure. Which brings me to my suggestion: can somebody build a &quot;I don't really use Facebook&quot; Facebook application? Something that would display itself prominently on my profile page and respond to any messages by politely inviting the sender to email me instead?</p>
<p>I'm not trying to be a jerk, I promise. I have more or less made my peace with FB; I just don't have the time or inclination to start using it seriously, and I'm getting sick of sending notes to new online acquaintances politely explaining that it's not them, it's me.</p>

                    <p>For a moment, anyway. Beginning two Saturdays ago it was the beach in North Carolina; then it was Jeff and Marie's wedding in California; today it's Emily's birthday(!) in DC; tomorrow it's back to California for work; Friday it's the City Veins' CD release party at Iota; Saturday it's a belated birthday dinner with Emily in Philadelphia, hosted by our friends Tara and John Carlos.</p>
<p>In short, I am probably going to die. But then, I always knew that, and for a while now have been halfway-suspecting the Chinatown bus would be responsible in one way or another.</p>

                    <p>My apologies for using this forum for something as tedious as the following. But there seem to be some misconceptions about how our transportation system is supposed to work, and this seems like the most efficient way to get the word out:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first"><strong>To the operators of the Chinatown bus:</strong> If, after several years of continuous operation without imposing a numbered boarding system on your passengers, you suddenly decide to implement such a system, you should expect some confusion. This may be exacerbated if you tell passengers who go into your office to obtain such a number that they don't need one. And, when faced with the first passenger of those waiting who is denied passage on the bus — a handsome young man who is clearly frustrated but remains at least somewhat polite — you might consider offering him something other than your assurance that his ticket will work on tomorrow's bus. Although your sheepish facial expressions were at least somewhat appreciated.</p>
</p></li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>To the woman with whom I offered to split a cab to the train station:</strong> &quot;Splitting&quot; a cab generally means that you will pay for half of the fare, rather than merely offering offering a sullen two dollars when prompted.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>To Amtrak:</strong> Frankly, I don't know where to begin. The 500% price difference from the bus? The delay? The fact that you don't let us wait on the platform, instead preferring to patronizingly queue us up and shuttle us around like livestock? You know what, nevermind. These are topics for violent revolution, not for blogging.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>To the girl I sat next to in the Quiet Car:</strong> The aforementioned car is so-named because cell phones are prohibited. Also prohibited, if only implicitly (but by common sense and taste in addition to Amtrak): having your Sidekick's sound effects set to maximum volume as you endlessly fiddle with it.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>To the operators of the Circulator bus:</strong> If you have been pursued for several blocks by a tired-looking — although still handsome, mind you — young man, it is a frequently-extended courtesy to pause for a moment longer than usual at your next stop so that he might catch up. This is particularly true if yours is the last bus of the night.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>To God:</strong> Causing it to begin raining immediately after the previously described events lacks both subtlety and wit. You have shown in the past that you can do better.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>To DC taxi drivers:</strong> Don't you honk at me, you despicable mountebanks. Shouldn't you be off somewhere getting a meter installed?</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>To the seemingly non-homeless woman whom I caught going to the bathroom between parked cars on my street:</strong> I appreciate your apology, but that does not change the fact that what you were undertaking to do is not in keeping with the road's intended function.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks for your attention, everybody. With a little practice I'm sure we can work out these kinks.</p>

                    <p>I have just returned from the dentist. The news is not good.</p>
<p>This was my first visit to Dr. Mills, but it was immediately obvious that she is a good-natured woman of immense cheer — I saw her give a fellow patient a butt-bump in the lobby to congratulate her recent weight loss. She and her hygienist daughter are both gentle and reassuring. But even Dr. Mills couldn't stop an &quot;Oh boy&quot; from escaping her lips as she stared at my teeth. Nor did she lie to me when I looked up and said, &quot;I'm in big trouble, aren't I?&quot;</p>
<p>It's my own fault, of course. To begin with, I haven't been to the Dentist since the Kerry campaign. But my culpability is worse than just that.</p>
<p>The last time I visited a dentist occurred in the waning days of my brain's susceptibility to maternal nagging. I drove over to Dr. W's office near Central Library on one of the Saturday mornings he favored for my family's appointments. Dr. W was a kind, effeminate man who always smelled like Vaseline. His magazine selection was terrible, but he was content to listen to patients' wishes and drill as little as possible. He was very accommodating. Too accommodating.</p>
<p>It had been obvious to me for some time that dental technology would continue — must continue! — to evolve. Caps? Fillings? Invisalign? These baroque appeals to vanity won't stand the test of time. How much more maintainable, elegant, even, to mount a simple feed impeller and set of crushing pins. If you've ever watched <a class="reference external" href="http://store.aetv.com/html/product/index.jhtml?id=76714">Modern Marvels</a> you understand what I mean. History will vindicate me.</p>
<p>I knew, of course, that the adoption of ore-crushing technology by the dental arts was still some years away. But such were the remedies I was considering: my formerly perfect teeth had shown their first signs of weakness over the year preceding this visit, and I was keen to halt the downward trend.</p>
<p>So I hatched a plan, and proposed it to Dr. W: what about sealants? A slowly-degrading plastic film over my molars like the one I had been given in childhood. It would keep decay out, like the bubble dome surrounding a post-zombie-apocalypse city. Dr. W considered this proposal. He couldn't see why not.</p>
<p>Dr. W closed that office soon after, though whether out of shame or fear of criminal liability, I couldn't say. When I explained the situation to Dr. Mills she asked me where I had gotten the procedure done and was surprised to hear me say Arlington. Clearly she had been expecting to hear the phrase &quot;crime alley&quot;, or perhaps &quot;Soviet prison&quot;. My teeth are fine, you see — except for the area around the sealants, where grey veins snake outward, like contagion seeping from newly-landed meteors of mysterious origin.</p>
<p>Soon I will be more dental amalgam than man. The question now is simply whether it will take two more visits or three to complete the transformation. It is too late for me... but perhaps others can be saved. So heed my words:</p>
<p>Don't go to the dentist. Wait for the crushing pins.</p>

<p>I'll tell you why not: because as soon as I'm done I'll be told that my previously locked-in reservation has expired, that making the same one will now cost 33% more, and I'll get a busy signal when I call their 800 number to complain. Go to hell, Branson.</p>

                    <p>There are, of course, many tragic aspects of neocolonialism, from economic distortions to the perversion of native culture to the fundamental outrage of diminishing a people's capacity for self-determination. But it's great for tourists.</p>
<p>And this was Emily's and my guiding concern as we made for Puerto Rico. <a class="reference external" href="http://duetorre.blogspot.com/">Mike D</a> had suggested it as a cheap and easy Caribbean destination, and it didn't disappoint. No passports, no garishly-colored money, and, for any place a tourist is likely to venture, no need to speak a language other than 'merican. Better yet, a reliable supply of cruise ship passengers allows you to avoid feeling like the most pathetic person in a given room.</p>
<p>We started off in San Juan, which bills itself somewhat hilariously as &quot;the city that outgrew its walls&quot;. Well, it did outgrow them, but the tourist trade hasn't. Sightseers seem to stay within the impressive and picturesque boundaries of Old San Juan, and we were no exceptions. It's got forts; it's got beautiful ocean views; it's got scores of stray cats. It also seems to have a lot of young people who came for the aforementioned attractions and stayed for the heroin.</p>
<p>Wandering through the forts is thrilling for any red-blooded <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sid_Meier's_Pirates!">Pirates! enthusiast</a>, our hotel was <a class="reference external" href="http://www.dahousehotelpr.com/">very nice</a> and we had a great time staring at the ocean and surreptitiously listening to spring breakers' conversations in bars. But truthfully, one night in San Juan was enough for me. Vieques beckoned.</p>
<p>For most of the twentieth century Vieques was used by the Navy for munitions storage and as a practice spot for <a class="reference external" href="http://flickr.com/photos/sbma44/2341900681/">blowing things up</a>. In 1993 they accidentally killed somebody, and that was pretty much the end of that. The Navy wound up surrendering almost all of the land they held to the Puerto Rican government and the National Park Service. The Navy's departure wiped out the island's economy but opened up new travel possibilities, which are just now being developed. The result is an English-speaking island with reasonable prices, pristine beaches and a tourism industry that makes things comfortable but hasn't yet become grotesquely large.</p>
<p>Getting there was pretty fun in its own right. We flew in a tiny Cessna belonging to the recently reopened <a class="reference external" href="http://www.mnaviation.com/">M&amp;N Aviation</a> (thanks for the understanding, FAA! you dudes are alright). Our pilot showed up about ten minutes before departure time, and, not bothering to waste time asking for our names or IDs, quickly loaded us onto the plane. Within moments we were in the air, watching San Juan recede beneath us.</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/2341893777/"><img alt="our trusty pilot" class="center" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2150/2341893777_f4e53f0afb.jpg" style="width: 375px; height: 500px;" /></a></p>

<p>Fifteen scenic minutes later we approached Vieques:</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/2341893957/"><img alt="approaching vieques" class="center" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2007/2341893957_f0de104e9a.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: 375px;" /></a></p>
<p>And things went downhill from there. Here, have a look at <a class="reference external" href="http://escape.topuertorico.com/pr-bin/yellowC.cgi?categ=Car+Rental">this webpage</a>. See &quot;Carlos Jeep Rental&quot;? If you had to guess based on this listing, what island would you say that business is located on? Maybe I just don't understand how these things work, but at the time I made the booking the &quot;Vieques&quot; directly across from their phone number seemed somewhat suggestive.</p>
<p>Actually, though, they're located on Culebra, and their jeeps are tragically non-amphibious. They were very nice about refunding my non-refundable deposit, though, and soon we were riding in a public car toward our hotel, feeling only mild panic about finding another Jeep to rent.</p>
<p>The hotel was the second part of the trip that I had been responsible for booking, and naturally I screwed it up pretty badly, too. But <a class="reference external" href="http://www.viequestropicalguesthouse.com/index2.html">look at the cheery colors</a>! Thrill to the friendly lady on the phone! Most of all, note the wifi. This is a principle I learned while traveling in Europe: if a place has wifi, it can't be <strong>that</strong> bad.</p>
<p>Sadly, that rule of thumb is no longer valid. Our hostess remained friendly, but the actual room was fairly bunkerlike, with no windows, a pervasive mildew odor and an awful mattress wrapped in unremovable plastic. Adding insult to injury, you could only get wifi reception outdoors. We stayed one night, but that was all we cared to take. In the morning I went to see the manager and debated the implications of the guest house's cancellation policy with a level of conciliation usually only reached when one or more of the parties has &quot;pluripotentiary&quot; in their title (although I don't think it prevented a looming Ragnarok between them and my credit card company).</p>
<p>Then we headed up the hill. On the advice of the TGH hostess and the lady in the bodega across the street we had walked to the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.seagatehotel.com">Sea Gate Hotel</a> the day before, where the owner Penny had kindly rented us one of the jeeps usually reserved for her own guests. Before meeting with Penny her assistant, Irma, generously volunteered to show us around the grounds. The SeaGate is beautiful, and when we found ourselves needing a new room we were thrilled to find that they had one available. It's situated on top of a hill, right by the fort, in a rolling sort of garden filled with palm trees, lizards, horses, chickens, dogs and cats (all of them friendly, except for the lizards who are merely indifferent). There's a three-floored building with less than a dozen rooms and suites, and a few cottages scattered around. You can see <a class="reference external" href="http://flickr.com/photos/sbma44/2341907197/">the ocean on the horizon</a> from most of the rooms over a tangled expanse of vegetation. It's really, really beautiful. <em>And</em> it was a better deal than our previous room.</p>
<p>Things picked up from there. The beaches are so beautiful that there's not much point in my describing them. Rambling over the island's dirt roads in a rickety jeep is enormously fun, and thanks to the Navy's abandoned bunkers, it's also entertainingly creepy:</p>

<p>Remember that made-for-TV movie I can't find on IMDB where a bunch of washed-up supermodels went to an island and there had been military experimentation and the government had left it infested with mutagen-filled sea urchins and vines and stuff and one by one everybody got stung and started turning into hideous were-[tropical wildlife]s? No? Alright, then how about <em>Lost</em>, you uncultured neanderthal? Heard about <em>Lost</em>? It's the one that's like <em>Party of Five</em> but on an island and sometimes with guns. Right, you know the one. What I'm trying to say is that if you were thinking of planning a theme vacation based around either of these properties, Vieques would be a good choice.</p>
<p>So: beaches, rotting military installations, <a class="reference external" href="http://flickr.com/photos/sbma44/2341902677/">fauna</a> — what else? Well, one week ago the Nabob <a class="reference external" href="http://pygmalioninablanket.blogspot.com/2008/03/fetch-is-distance-wind-blows-over-ocean.html">wrote this</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
I actively allowed someone to cheat off my final exam for that oceanography class. Now, heâ€™s a magician.</blockquote>
<p>There's one part of Vieques where that unique skillset — questionable oceanographic bona fides and supernatural showmanship — is in high demand: the biobay.</p>
<p>Mosquito Bay is a wide, shallow pool of water surrounded by Red Mangrove trees. It's also home to what we were told is the world's highest concentration of <em>pyrodinium bahamense</em>, a tiny creature that emits light when disturbed.</p>
<p>It's pretty amazing. You don't notice the effect as you kayak toward the middle of the bay. At first it seems like you're just unused to seeing the bubbles pulled down by your paddle through the clear Caribbean water. But then you dip your hand in and wave it around, and the bubbles persist regardless of how long you keep it submerged. Soon you reach to the center of the bay and the effect becomes truly undeniable. Any movement causes the water to emanate a surprisingly bright blue glow. Hop out of your kayak and your waving limbs will be surrounded with an unearthly aura. Move your arm just under the water's surface and it will trail millions of dots of blue phosphor; it's as if you were watching your own slow-motion pyrotechnic dissolution. Stick your head under the water and when you come up you'll be momentarily peppered with tiny stars that disappear in the air. It's stunning, and an experience I'd recommend to anyone. It's also pretty hard to photograph, but <a class="reference external" href="http://islavieques.com/biolinks.html">this is a decent attempt at faking it</a>.</p>
<p>Eventually Sunday rolled around. It began to rain; our new, less laid-back airline yelled at us for showing up ten minutes before departure time (give someone a second engine and suddenly they think they're a big shot, apparently). We discovered we were covered with sunburn and mosquito bites. It was time to get the hell home. But we had had a fantastic time. Puerto Rico in general and Vieques in particular are beautiful, filled with friendly people and are surprisingly accessible, both in terms of cost and travel. You should think about going.</p>
<p>I will issue one caveat, though: we weren't blown away by the food. Don't get me wrong, it's good, and I'm sure it can be great. We did have a really delicious meal at the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.bravobeachhotel.com/BBH_REST.html">Bravo Beach Hotel</a>, and were perhaps not as adventurous about patronizing the alluring food carts that dotted the island as we could've been. But the island's basic culinary philosophy boils down to lots of plantains and as many land animals as can be mustered, particularly pork. That's all cooked on top of a sofrito base or breaded and fried. It's not bad, but it is kind of heavy and monotonous, and the lack of delicious sea creatures was disappointing. And on Vieques the situation is even more dire, since the island seems to have no agriculture of its own and so any less-than-top-end restaurants will lean heavily on frozen and canned ingredients.</p>
<p>But this is a small complaint. It's easy to find great sandwiches, <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mofongo">mofongo</a> is delicious, and we had some of the best coffee I can remember in San Juan. The omnipresent national beer, <a class="reference external" href="http://flickr.com/photos/sbma44/2341899239/">Medalla</a>, is also <a class="reference external" href="http://www.thebackpacker.net/worldbeers/medalla_1612_worldbeers.htm">pretty great</a>. It's just an American-style light lager, but it's tasty and comes in ten ounce increments — this is ideal, as it turns out that it's only the last two ounces of beer in a given can that are responsible for getting you drunk. So you can sit on the beach consuming can after golden, ten-ounce can without suffering any incapacitation.</p>
<p>Of course the island is also filled with rum punch and pina colada opportunities, if that's your thing (the former: sort of; the latter: not so much, thanks to childhood memories of its vile Slurpee incarnation). I am sorry to report, however, that the San Juan bar we patronized was unable to fulfill requests for Buttery Nipples and Sexes on the Beach, much to the dismay of the loud girls who surrounded us.</p>
<p>Oh yeah! Photos. Here's the complete set:</p>

                    <p>Hey there. I'm no longer in Puerto Rico! Oh, right, I should've mentioned: Emily and I are going to Puerto Rico. Were going. Sorry. You know what I mean.</p>
<p>Despite what I will immodestly call an impressive series of attempts to ruin the vacation, I was ultimately unsuccessful and we ended up having a great time. Beaches so pristine as to border on cliche; rutted dirt roads weaving through palm trees and abandoned bunkers; a full assortment of rum, both spiced and regular. We were basically living in a Corona commercial for five days, except with mercifully few Corona drinkers around us.</p>
<p>It's taking an effort to avoid writing thousands more words about it right now, so I'd best cut this short while I still can. I'll have more to say once timesheets have been filled out and some lidocaine/aloe solution acquired. For now I'll just point out that the Caribbean is exactly as nice as you've been led to believe, and if you aren't booking tickets there <em>right now</em> you're not using your computer to optimal effect.</p>

                    <p>Well, I got hit by a car again. It's pretty stupid, but I thought you should know.</p>
<p>It was Thursday evening, and I was biking home from work. The intersection of 12th and O is a four way stop two blocks from my house — actually three-way, I suppose, since 12th is a one-way street that runs North. I was headed East.</p>
<p>And I was good! My <a class="reference external" href="http://dcist.com/2006/03/19/opinionist_dont.php">cyclist-lawbreaking apologism</a> notwithstanding, in this case I played by the rules. I got to the intersection and stopped, or at least slowed as close to a stop as a bicycle can while maintaining enough gyroscopic mojo to stay upright. The car to my right went through the intersection and I then proceeded. I was surprised to see the next car begin accelerating, but to be honest my first thought was <em>Oh no you're not</em>: this is usually the point at which the driver stops short, and I take smirking pleasure in knowing that another motorist has been shocked and angered by a momentary awareness of drivers' perpetual irresponsibility.</p>
<p>Except this time the car didn't stop. It sped smoothly into my bike's front wheel, flipping me around and depositing me on the pavement. I'm not sure exactly where my body went in relation to the car, but I know the other guy left the intersection without a driver's side mirror.</p>
<p>With characteristic wit I screamed MOTHERFUCKER and wandered shakily out of the intersection. This is the wisdom I can offer about unexpected physical trauma: you're suddenly going to be stuffed full of adrenaline, and that's going to make you quite bad at thinking and evaluating your physical state. The best you can hope for is recognizing your own impairment and prioritizing a few key things. In this case that meant pushing through my sudden kinetic confusion and getting down the car's tags. Because at that moment the driver showed no signs of stopping.</p>
<p>Eventually he did. There was nowhere to go, for one thing — traffic ahead; angry, honking motorists behind. And I'm now inclined to think he was even more shocked and confused than I was (motorists: exactly like bears). He eventually stopped about halfway down the block. I called 911, and there was a cruiser on the scene before I had even hung up. The cop took my statement and that of a nice lady who'd been kind enough to stop, make sure I was okay and then take some photos of the scene.</p>
<p>Eventually the other driver came over. He was an enormously tall African gentleman, seemingly near retirement age. He appeared to be heading home from his job as a security guard, and it looked like he was blind in one eye. He was taciturn, shocked and withdrawn, but through embarrassed mumbles he said he was sorry; he thanked God for protecting me, and hoped aloud that he would bless me further; he said that life is the best, most important thing. He hoped that I would forgive him.</p>
<p>In short, he did not seem to be the type of guy whose personal misfortune could be considered a karmic positive. So although I still felt pretty pissy as we shook hands, I also knew that it wouldn't last. I plan to talk to his insurance company about the $150 worth of attention that my bike needs, and EchoDitto wants me to make some inquiries about their dinged-up laptop, so I guess I'll be doing that. But otherwise the upshot was just a sore knee, shin and shoulder. I still made it onto that evening's 8 p.m. Chinatown bus.</p>
<p>So while I'm dreading the coming insurance-wrangling, it wasn't too bad overall. Certainly it was better than when I got hit by a cop car in high school — that hurt my body and my bike less, but also ended up with me getting a ticket and my dad having to threaten a lawsuit to get the Arlington County Police Department to stop sending us bills for unrelated damage to the cruiser. I think I'm getting a hang of this vehicular catastrophe business, and am hopeful that by the next time I'll really have the routine down pat.</p>
<p>Oh! I should also draw your attention to the lack of &quot;head injury&quot; in my list of woes. I haven't pored over my helmet yet for signs of impact, but this story could've been a lot less happy (although also perhaps less overwritten) if I hadn't been wearing it. So, you know: embrace the dorkiness.</p>

                    <p>Yup, still sick, although not as deliriously so as I was over the last four days — this is some bad stuff. Mostly I've been confined to lying on the couch feeling sorry for myself. But Saturday's activities did also include an unexpected win at Scrabble and confirmation of Philadelphia's banh mi supremacy — Emily and I checked out <a class="reference external" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/02/05/AR2008020500888_pf.html">Song Que and Nhu Lan</a>, and though the latter has definitely got something to offer in terms of mayo &amp; bread, both offered insultingly small portions of jalapeno and cilantro. It was still pretty delicious, though. And it's always good to be reminded of how stupid an idea bubble tea is.</p>
<p>I'm still producing much more snot than ideas, so for now I'll just ask: anybody want to go to <a class="reference external" href="http://dorkbot.org/dorkbotdc/">Dorkbot</a> tomorrow night? Alberto Gaitan is presenting the second half of his talk on <a class="reference external" href="http://selforganizingsystem.org/co_rem.html">Remembrancer</a>. It should be pretty interesting.

                    <p>God dammit. I was feeling good about my prospects this year. Yes, I spent two and a half weeks sick. But so did everyone else! I was just trying to fit in! Besides, that length of time isn't that bad by my historical standards. Generally speaking I spend about every twelfth day of the year coughing or sneezing or otherwise being unpleasant to be around, and doing so in an extremely biological manner. I thought this year's stats would be an improvement.</p>
<p>But this morning I woke up with a 101 degree fever. My eyes stung. My lungs felt like burlap covered with cat hair, and my spine felt like a tube of pantyhose crammed full of pointy garbage. I took a sick day and lord was it ever a good idea.</p>
<p>The afternoon's been filled with cranberry juice and bad science fiction movies (when Henry Rollins and Dolph Lundgren are by far the best actors in a production you know you're looking at a quality piece of cinema). Tomorrow? Well, we'll see.</p>

                    <p>Last Wednesday's annual candy heart rumination aside, I haven't really written much here since getting back from New Orleans. It feels like I've gotten worse and worse at recording what I've been up to, which is of course unfair both to myself and to the historians of the future. So:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>I flew to San Francisco and went to some meetings about a social network for lesbians, where they can be free from the flagrantly heteronormative &quot;poke&quot; frame. Then there was some emergency pre-Valentine's chocolate acquisition and a business development meeting <a class="reference external" href="http://www.slanteddoor.com/">here</a> with a prospective client. For those unfamiliar with the lingo, &quot;business development&quot; means talking about how great the internet is while the company buys you bourbon. It's easier than it probably sounds.
Nicco piloted our top-down rental convertible toward SFO in characteristically terrifying fashion, and soon I was sitting in the airport bar, almost exactly 24 hours after I had landed. I chatted with a nice couple who were in town for some sort of trade show. They expressed amazement at my phone and irritation at having to press one to get English voicemail prompts. I opted to pick my battles and focused on getting the bartender's attention. This proved to be a bad idea.
It didn't seem that way at first. I got on the plane and was pleasantly surprised to find that I had a whole row to myself. I zoned out, then spread out, then passed out. The stumble to the bathroom went okay, but the one coming out didn't turn out as well.
My friend Scott is a medic in the Army. He's got as many mortifyingly hilarious stories as you might expect; some of my favorites are about his training. Mostly these are about doing unpleasant things to goats, but occasionally the trainees just do unpleasant things to each other. In one exercise partners take turns wearing inflatable pressure pants and dosing themselves with vasodilators, then abruptly pull the plug on the pants. If you do this — and I'm not suggesting that you do — all the blood will immediately drop out of the top half of your body and you'll go into shock (this is still a better gig than being an Army goat).
That's pretty much what I felt like as I stumbled down the aisle, hung over, sleep deprived, blinded by the lavatory lights and generally out of it. I pawed at some unfortunate passengers' heads, desperately searching for any empty row that could plausibly be my own. It felt very, very good when I found one and collapsed into it. I woke up long enough to curse the Pittsburgh airport, then got home and slept through half the day.</li>
<li>Also, I had super-birth-valentine's-day-stravaganza! I turned 28 on Friday, but was too busy being spoiled rotten by Emily to really notice. For Valentine's we went to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.saltandpepperphilly.com/">Salt &amp; Pepper</a>, where they fed us well and plied us with port and grappa. We went to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.southwarkrestaurant.com/">Southwark</a> afterward and did some self-plying. The birthday-day was even better (probably because I had no part in planning it): we went to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.dockstreetbeer.com/">Dock Street</a> and ate fancy pizza with some fine folks, saw <em>Jumper</em>, and grabbed a drink at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.chickscafe.com/">Chick's</a>. I can recommend all of these things highly (although I admit I may be confusing the actual movie <em>Jumper</em> with the abstract concept of teleportation).
Then: DC! Dave &amp; Buster's! Giant stuffed frogs! My thanks to everybody who dared venture into what is probably the most hostile environment not currently being considered for hosting an international peacekeeping force. I had a great time, but it turns out that friends are better for talking to than they are for enlistment into ad-hoc anti-zombie strike forces (no offense, guys). So this is perhaps not going to be the first installment of an annual tradition. On the other hand, I still have an awful lot of credits on my Power Card...</li>

                    <p>If you're making a post-apocalyptic science fiction epic and are having trouble budgeting for the outdoor shots, I have a suggestion.</p>
<p>So, as I mentioned, EchoDitto just got back from our annual retreat. This year we did something different and scheduled a service project for our first day together. The idea was to start things on a positive note, get everyone working as a team, and hopefully do some good. Being a company forged from the remains of a liberal presidential campaign, we naturally decided to accomplish this by destroying a church.</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/silbatron/2243424216/"><img alt="image1" class="center" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2392/2243424216_b4b2aed299.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Of course, it was pretty well destroyed to begin with. The church in question was located in New Orleans' lower ninth ward, close enough to the water that you could see the levees from the front door. I don't know how high the water got there, exactly — twenty feet? twenty-five? — but it was high enough to engulf two floors of a church sanctuary. Three years later, much of the mud was still wet.</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://flickr.com/photos/yovanoff/2232387458/"><img alt="image2" class="center" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2352/2232387458_d1ac2bf39e.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>This was all set up for us by <a class="reference external" href="http://www.acorn.org">ACORN</a>, an organization that not only lined up the opportunity but also provided the equipment necessary to keep us from dying (or getting sick, anyway). So we donned our <a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/silbatron/2231264878/">allegedly-Tyvek suits</a>, gloves, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/silbatron/2242618123/">goggles and respirators</a> and set to work.</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://flickr.com/photos/yovanoff/2231596361/in/photostream"><img alt="view of church from up top" class="center" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2015/2231596361_46a82c0ff9.jpg" /></a></p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/silbatron/2242935629/"><img alt="image3" class="center" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2029/2242935629_09e0ee6053.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>First up: destroying pews. Ben came up with a pretty good system for demolition, and soon we had dragged them all out to the curb. That left us faced with the mud. Oh, the mud.</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/silbatron/2243417528/"><img alt="image4" class="center" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2092/2243417528_fdfbf5f558.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Although there was plenty of wet, shoe-grabbing muck conveniently located near the doors, most of it was like this: thick, caked, dry. The clumps were easily an inch thick, and hard to break. It was like enormous pieces of pottery had been shattered and precisely arranged into a plane. Shovels and wheelbarrows arrived just in time.</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://flickr.com/photos/yovanoff/2232387824/"><img alt="working" class="center" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2013/2232387824_97ef352040.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Under the mud there was a layer of carpet stubbornly clinging to life. The less said about the ensuing struggle the better. In the end we got it done — the place was stripped, ready for ACORN's lead and mold remediation measures and then, hopefully, for a congregation that's ready to rebuild.</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://flickr.com/photos/yovanoff/2232387106/"><img alt="finished" class="center" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2350/2232387106_f57ee2f2b2.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Throughout the experience it was hard to know what I should be thinking and feeling. Would anyone come back to this building? To this neighborhood? There were no residents watching us work; no church members on hand to choose what to save. We might as well have been excavating an archaeological site. It was easy enough to imagine the despair the deacons felt upon first entering their ruined church, but whatever sorrow might have remained in the place had turned stale and seeped out of the hole in the wall. It was empty.</p>
<p>Plus, reality was being a bit over the top. I mean, c'mon: ladies' shoes? A destroyed organ? A waterlogged Bible? <em>Mud encrusted children's toys?!</em> It was all very maudlin and, frankly, unbelievable. That sort of lack of subtlety would never fly on HBO.</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/silbatron/2243727122/"><img alt="shoes" class="center" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2338/2243727122_7f02b352b5.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>But once we had finished the ACORN folks gave us a tour of the lower ninth ward, and the enormity of the situation became apparent and more immediately striking.</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/silbatron/2242658765/"><img alt="image5" class="center" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2292/2242658765_9a751a22ca.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>These markings mean that the house was searched on 9/12 by a crew identified as &quot;TFW&quot;. They found zero bodies, but the &quot;NE&quot; stands for &quot;no entry&quot; so that number's actually meaningless. Looks like they found a dog, too. Three years later, these spray paint markings are still on nearly every house.</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/silbatron/2243436422/"><img alt="image6" class="center" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2411/2243436422_5954ce9bda.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>This is the new levee. It's three years later, but this structure, allegedly temporary, is all that has been rebuilt. <a class="reference external" href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/05/070506-orleans-levees.html?fs=www3.nationalgeographic.com&amp;fs=plasma.nationalgeographic.com">It's built to the same flawed design as the one it replaced, and built badly at that</a>.</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/silbatron/2242652573/"><img alt="image7" class="center" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2346/2242652573_5ca2af5756.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>This used to be someone's front stoop. Three years later, the missing house is one of the few visible signs of deliberate progress, if you want to call it that. Whether the owner paid to have it torn down or whether the city did it for them because they were deemed not to be maintaining the property — who knows?</p>
<p>I don't mean to imply that the situation is hopeless. We met a gentleman named Mac who says that God told him to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.lower9thwardvillage.org/">build a community center</a>, so he did. It's an amazing thing. The ACORN volunteers were awfully inspiring, too. But there's still so much to do, so few people, so little attention paid. It's taken years just to accomplish what anyone could reasonably expect the world's richest country to accomplish in weeks. We should all be ashamed.</p>

                    <p>Hi there. Have you been wondering where I am? No, probably not. But look, I was gone: to New Orleans, with the rest of the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.echoditto.com">EchoDitto</a> crew for our annual retreat, which this year happened to coincide with the beginning of Mardis Gras.</p>
<p>Prior to this trip all I knew about New Orleans came from <a class="reference external" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107076/">Hard Target</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://hypem.com/search/radiohead%20glass%20house/1/">that one Radiohead song with the clarinet</a>. Both proved to be reliable guides, although anyone preparing for a similar trip would also do well to review the scene at a frat party — ideally one attended by several hundred thousand people.</p>
<p>I have lots of stories to tell (two!), and will get to them as soon as I can. At the moment I'm too busy grappling with the fact that I enjoy and am inspired by <a class="reference external" href="http://yeswecansong.com">something affiliated with the Black Eyed Peas</a>; also, pleasant exhaustion.</p>

                    <p>The new television has arrived, and it's pretty cool. I'll try not to dwell on this piece of especially conspicuous consumption, since even my gadget-addled brain is still dimly aware that doing so is kind of tacky.</p>
<p>I will note, though, that it's already making me considerably dumb (<strong>UPDATE:</strong> -er! dumb<em>er</em>! See what I mean?) . Last night I found myself watching an unusually stupid episode of an unusually stupid/successful television show — CSI. This particular episode centered around a semen-wrangling-operation-gone-awry (as they inevitably must) within the glamorous world of professional bullriding. It was immediately apparent that this is the sort of show where &quot;character development&quot; means &quot;having a character grow a beard&quot;. Worst of all, I watched it after having voluntarily given up the ability to skip commercials.</p>
<p>And yet! It was so <em>entrancing</em>. The CGI bull skeleton? <em>Magnifique!</em> And look, you can make out the lettering on the electrical ejaculation stimulator! How could I turn away? Who was I to think I might be able to turn away?</p>
<p>We settled in and ate our delivery pizza without ranch sauce, but it was not for lack of trying.</p>

                    <p>Now that comments are working, let me ask a question. Part of Irresponsible Holiday Spending Spree '07 was the purchase, by Charles and myself, of an HDTV. It's backordered from Fry's at the moment, but I'm assured by many Amazon commenters that it'll be great. When Sunday school classes ponder the question &quot;Could God make a TV so big that He couldn't watch it?&quot;, this is the set they use to illustrate the point (Answer: &quot;We can never know. But lo! Surely He would have delivered unto us these three HDMI inputs, for He is just and good.&quot;).</p>
<p>So we've got a lot of new pixels, or will have them in short order. We don't have enough signal to keep them occupied, though. So it's time to say goodbye to our beloved DirecTivo. But should we consider DirecTV's hi-def package, or go talk to Comcast? Is one hopelessly inferior to the other, or is it worth taking the time to shake each down with the trademark mixture of cajoling and threats (think &quot;abusive husband from Law &amp; Order&quot;) that I use in all my interactions with customer service representatives? Help me internet, you're my only hope.</p>

                    <p>It's now safe to say: I'm sick. This is no surprise, of course — it happens to me every winter, and with enough severity that I'm told I'm commonly described as &quot;sickly&quot;. But I had high hopes for this year! I've started taking vitamin D, The Supernutrient They Don't Want You To Know About (except via features in Reader's Digest). I'm adopting an optimistic interpretation of the vitamin's powers and assuming that without it my body would presently be undergoing incineration at the hands of concerned NIH workers in contamination suits.</p>
<p>I take some comfort in knowing that this bug has also laid waste to everyone else I know. Considering that my immune system is capable of amplifying the pathogens contained in a kitten's single adorable sneeze into a maelstrom of phlegm and whining worthy of an unusually tedious episode of <em>House</em>, this is an improvement. At least I know my body's surrendering to a worthy microbe.</p>

                    <p>Well, it's been a pretty restful holiday break, but tomorrow it all ends. This past week or so of vacation has been disappointingly unproductive — I barely got to the gym at all, I didn't really write anything, and I only made minor progress on the two technical projects I had in mind. In fact, I spent an amazingly small amount of time online. If you're one of the people to whom I should've been writing emails, I apologize.</p>
<p>But I did manage to get to a hell of a lot of parties, see a number of old friends (albeit not as many as I would've liked) and wake up on New Year's Day feeling like I was probably not going to die after all (better yet, I didn't even want to!). Pretty good, all in all.</p>
<p>Anyway, all I really mean to say here is that I'm looking forward to returning to routine. I'm hoping that 2008 is bloggier, healthier and even more fun than 2007 was.</p>

                    <p>Back! Back from San Diego, which appeared to currently be running some sort of citywide promotional tie-in with upcoming feature file <a class="reference external" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0884328/">The Mist</a>. It was nice enough, I guess: I attended meetings, ate continental breakfasts, and toured a number of culturally significant faux-adobe strip malls. Also, I watched about a million episodes of Deadwood's second season. Combined with jetlag, this is leading me to formulate sentences in some pretty strange/pretentious ways.</p>
<p>The trip was good, but my primary objective was only partially accomplished: I wanted to eat as many fish tacos as possible. Admittedly, &quot;as possible&quot; is somewhat nebulous goal. Still, I can identify a full two meals that conceivably could have involved fish tacos but didn't. I definitely could've done better than the soggy, lackluster experience at the airport Rubio's. And although <a class="reference external" href="http://el-callejon.com/Encinitas_Main.html">El Callejon</a> was tasty, its lack of Baja sauce, cabbagelessness, and single-ply corn tortillas provided a different taco experience than I had been expecting. Fortunately, margaritas eased the shock.</p>
<p>Anyway, if you're visiting San Diego I suggest you avoid those two restaurants and instead opt for That One Place Near The Water That I Went To With Jeff And Paul That One Time. It's as delicious as you've heard.</p>

I'm pretty sure I ate five different types of pie, then spent the rest of the night alternating between picking Spree off of a gingerbread house and complaining about what an awful candy Spree is. Overall: delicious, but incapacitating.</li>
<li>After a Sunday morning train ride home, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.thecityveins.com/blog">Charles</a> was nice enough to bring me along to the Redskins game. On the way to the stadium our Metro car's brakes malfunctioned, filling the air with a smell so acrid that it made my eyes water and almost certainly gave me lung cancer. Yet somehow the Redskins managed to make a painful, wasting death look comparatively good. God, what a sucky football team. Still, the Philadelphia Eagles remain the worst team in football, at least morally speaking.</li>
<li>Yesterday I went swimming, and <em>man</em> am I bad at it. Forget the flailing and gasping for breath; it's the kicking that really gives me trouble. It's not that I can't do it — I don't sink and I'm a lot faster than the old guys, at least. But somehow my knee is now more sore than if I'd just run on the damn thing, making me think that my mechanics leave something to be desired. No-impact my ass.</li>
<li>Then I drove down to Louisa to have dinner with my mom, which turns out to be a good way to come back from a holiday weekend feeling exhausted. Thanksgiving now, please.</li>

                    <p>Mom's surgery went well. The radial nerves in her arm had to be moved, which is a bit worrisome and resulted in more post-surgical weakness than the doctors would have liked. But she's not in too much pain, and she says she can already feel that her arm is better-aligned than it was. Everyone's optimistic that with work, patience and perhaps another procedure she'll recover her full dexterity.</p>
<p>This is no great revelation, but: hospitals are depressing. Everyone is just so <em>helpless</em>. The medical staff perform a strange pantomime of patient-empowerment, offering treatment options as if they'll be met with thoughtful consideration rather than endlessly rephrased versions of &quot;what do <em>you</em> think we should do?&quot; You're at the mercy of fate, the insurance company and your own ignorance.</p>
<p>It's worse when you watch it happening to someone whom you arrogantly identify as less-equipped to make informed decisions. Although they do so gently and respectfully, the nurses' approach toward their uneducated, unhealthy and generally unlucky patients resembles nothing so much as that of an adult who unexpectedly finds himself babysitting the lost child of lawyers. They're very deferent, but their respectfulness comes from protocol, manners and professional fear rather than, y'know, respect. It's hard not to wonder what these exchanges accomplish.</p>
<p>Of course, a paternalist with even a <em>little</em> self-awareness (a title to which I aspire) can't look at this interplay for very long without realizing that he's just as enmeshed in it as any of the people around him — it's just that he has the problem of being an insufferable snob, too.</p>
<p>So I tried to put aside my pretensions and abjectly surrender myself to the situation. I stopped judging the wheelchair-bound smokers in front of the building. I watched Wheel of Fortune with interest. I listened to a sweatsuited manchild complaining to his elderly mother that the hospital firewall didn't allow him to check Britney Spears' MySpace page for news of her new album. I listened, identified, despaired.</p>
<p>Then I resumed doing what the doctors told me until I could return to a place where it's easier to forget about free will.</p>

                    <p>I'm down in Charlottesville for a couple of days, helping my mom get around as she gets some more surgery on her arm (it never quite healed properly from her motorcycle accident 15 months ago). There are a bunch of restaurants and bars that I used to frequent as an undergrad just a short walk from the hospital, and the nurses assured me that hanging around the waiting room would gain me nothing except, perhaps, a deadly staph infection. So I wandered up to the Corner, had lunch at Bodo's (now with <a class="reference external" href="http://matthewyglesias.theatlantic.com/archives/2007/05/monday_bagel_blogging.php">official Jewish approval</a> — he's matrilinear &amp; everything!) and then wandered over to Plan 9 music, where I've been sipping coffee and having very little luck using the free wireless.</p>
<p>This provides a handy excuse for why I haven't yet completed my timesheet, but it also means that I just lost an entire batch of meticulously-tagged Halloween photos when the upload died partway through. This brings me to the putative reason for this post: there's got to be something better than the OS X Flickr Uploadr, right? The goddamn thing has a single failure mode: catastrophic. I appreciate simplicity, but I kind of expected Flickr to take some of the savings it enjoys from vowel-related cost-cutting and reinvest it in software development.</p>

                    <p>I was sitting in a not-that-eventful software development event this afternoon when I got a phone call from an unknown number. I expected this — my mom was scheduled to have some surgery tomorrow and the hospital's patient-wrangler was due to call and tell me where we needed to be and when.</p>
<p>But no! It was MPD on the line, wanting to confirm my identity and address and then informing me that Charles' and my apartment had been broken into. I think I said something off-color like &quot;oh jeez!&quot; and set off on my bike.</p>
<p>Apparently some jerk had pulled up in a plausible-looking van from a HVAC company. I guess he had tried to pry open the front door, since some of the trim had been removed and the police found a prybar in a backpack in the garbage can. But that didn't work. So he set up some not-that-official-looking cones and a ladder and used them to climb through a window.</p>
<p>The same thing happened to our neighbor Paul about a year ago. Fortunately, our neighbor Katie was home and kept an eye on the guy. She eventually decided that he looked shady enough to merit a call to the cops, who nabbed the guy as he was coming out. In his possession at the time: an iBook charger, a jar full of change and our beloved Nintendo Wii (no Wiimotes, though).</p>
<p>The cops took statements, dusted for prints, had me do a walkthrough and even gave us back our things. Throughout it all the officers and detective were friendly, professional, thorough and, in one case, kind of foxy.</p>
<p>Better yet, my mom's operation has been rescheduled. So I'm currently sitting on my couch in the sun, home from work, sipping coffee and getting ready to take care of some coding that I thought I was going to have to sprint to finish. Getting robbed is great!</p>
<p><strong>ALSO:</strong> <a class="reference external" href="http://blogstretch.blogspot.com">Amanda</a> tells me that she asked Travis Morrison my let's-say-one-eighth-joking question about his preferred Javascript library during her interview with him. Awesome. This has turned into a pretty good day.</p>

                    <p>Ryan, in a manner deeply unbecoming an economist, is <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ryanavent.com/blog/?p=525">questioning</a> the need for continued human progress:</p>
<blockquote>
I remember when men would shave with tools, real tools, that doubled as farm implements or at least good kitchen cutlery. And when we wanted a bracing splash of aftershave, well, thatâ€™s what the tumbler of scotch was for. All right, so I donâ€™t remember that, but I do remember when the two blade disposable you got in your freshman welcome pack was sufficient to hold things down until that study abroad trip junior year when you first tried growing a beard. Rust builds character, my friends.</blockquote>
<p>I'm sure this sentiment is heartfelt. But I can't help but note that both Ryan and certain other <a class="reference external" href="http://pygmalioninablanket.blogspot.com/2007/10/blood-tracks-water.html">razor traditionalists</a> can plausibly be described as Aryan Supermen. I'm sure it's very convenient to have the sort of blond, wispy facial hair that can be removed with gentle abrasion from, say, a disposable plastic dish scrubber. And I don't mean to disparage my own more problematic stubble — men like Kriston and myself find rough facial hair useful in a variety of situations, e.g. igniting a strike-anywhere match and using it, with cupped palms, to light a hand-rolled cigarette as we stare flintily at the loneliness of the great Western range. From horseback.</p>
<p>It's just that taming that sort of beard — some might call it the sort of beard that tamed America — requires more decisive, even violent measures. That's all.</p>
<p>Speaking of beards, here's a shot I took this morning before shaving:</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/1525538125/"><img alt="the october protobeard" class="center" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2129/1525538125_3dc59fe809.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: 375px;" /></a></p>
<p>As you can see, it still sucks. But I'm happy to say that this is only about five days' growth — reaching this point took much less time and involved much less discomfort than doing so has <a class="reference external" href="http://www.zunta.org/blog/archives/2006/01/02/personal_failur/index.php">in the past</a>. Like everything else in this increasingly globalized world, my beard's crappiness remains constant, but its cost is plummeting.</p>
<p>(Take <em>that</em>, Avent.)</p>

                    <p>Well, it was a beautiful weekend in Cazenovia — a fun wedding, a relaxing and productive couple of days after, and a nice time all around. Unfortunately, it seems that during the first twenty-some years of my life I was unknowingly using up my lifetime allotment of air travel karma. I can no longer set foot in an airport without some sort of travel apocalypse unfolding. If I checked bags I'd probably be dead by now.</p>
<p>Otherwise: work, busy, etc. I really need some sort of system to crawl out from under September. <a class="reference external" href="http://www.43folders.com/izero/">Inbox Zero</a> might be a little ambitious, though. For now I'd settle for RSS Reader One Thousand.</p>
<p>I don't mean to just whine, though — things aren't all bleak. For instance, I'm continuing to make strides in the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_fantasy_vi">struggle for the fair treatment of Espers</a>. In fact, let me take this opportunity to announce that I believe we've reached an accord with the Empire! It's a momentous achievement, to be sure.</p>
<p>Admittedly, there are some alarmists on the internet who warn of an impending ecological disaster that could result in a floating and/or abruptly-not-floating continent. However, I remain confident that such doomsaying is wholly unfounded (although the issue does merit more study).</p>

                    <p>...now that Charles is gone. He's spending the week celebrating <a class="reference external" href="http://www.darrenhiggins.com/">Darren</a> and Emilie's love over in Belgium, a country about which I know disappointingly few hilarious stereotypes. The happy couple is getting married in a castle, and apparently Charles has been drafted into the ceremony. I believe he'll be operating the portcullis.</p>
<p>His departure has left the house with too few people and too many options: I can't decide what to make filthy first. Last night's unexpected bout of burrito-making caprice left some promising food spills around the kitchen, but I ultimately decided that was an unambitious way to begin and cleaned them up. For now I've settled for leaving a pile of sweaty gym clothes on the couch — but this is merely the foundation for the work to come.</p>

<p><strong>CLERK:</strong> <a class="reference external" href="http://tinyurl.com/3x57kj">Mo/rris House Bed &amp; Breakfast</a>, how can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>ME:</strong> Yeah, hi. My parents got me a gift certificate to your hotel for my birthday and I'd like to make a reservation to use it.</p>
<p><strong>CLERK:</strong> Certainly sir, I can help you with that.</p>
<p><strong>ME:</strong> The only thing is, the certificate says it expires on August 31st, and I'd actually like to make the reservation for September 1st, the day after. Will that be a problem?</p>
<p><strong>CLERK:</strong> Uhh... I'll have to check. Can I call you back?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Later...</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>CLERK:</strong> Hi, this is Mo/rris House. I talked to my supervisor and she said it'll be fine for you to use the certificate on September 1st.</p>
<p><strong>ME:</strong> Great!</p>
<p><strong>CLERK:</strong> Let me just check and... oh. Hmm. There's a problem. We only have one qualifying room left on that date.</p>
<p><strong>ME:</strong> Great, that'll be fine.</p>
<p><strong>CLERK:</strong> No, see, I can't give you that room. It's our last one.</p>
<p><strong>ME:</strong> I don't understand. The certificate has been paid for... It's not like you're giving me the room for free.</p>
<p><strong>CLERK:</strong> I'm trying to work with you sir, but if you look at the gift certificate it does say &quot;subject to availability&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>ME:</strong> Right, and you just told me that a room is available.</p>
<p><strong>CLERK:</strong> Listen, I'm trying to work with you, sir. We're trying to be flexible about the date.</p>
<p><em>We go through this several more times. The hotel's policy does not begin to make more sense.</em></p>
<p><strong>ME (exasperated):</strong> Okay. I understand the hotel already has the money for this gift certificate and doesn't want to honor it if it can possibly earn more money from someone else instead. Can I pay an up-charge or something and get the room?</p>
<p><strong>CLERK:</strong> Uh... I'll have to check. Can I put you on hold?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Without hanging up, the clerk calls me on a different line.</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>CLERK:</strong> I got good news for you, sir! I can give you the room if you pay an extra $20.</blockquote>
<p>So fine, I paid the $20. But really now: c'mon. My parents' thoughtful gift has already been paid for with perfectly good money. It's time for you to honor your end of the bargain. Stop being such jerks.</p>
<p>I'm Googleproofing this for the time being so that the Mo/rris House people don't do horrible things to our breakfast or play more reservation shenanigans. But this is pretty sleazy behavior. It's just one goddamn day. Is it really worth jerking your clients around for an extra $20?</p>

<p>Mail is terrible. In my experience it's uniformly either irrelevant or bad news. Mostly it's the former, of course: American Express seems to feel they need to check in with me about four times a week, and various bafflingly unfamiliar organizations keep trying to push credit cards on me (at right: The American Quarter Horse Association's offer, received just a few hours before I wrote this).</p>
<p>The important stuff — which is, of course, indistinguishable from the junk — is always, always bad news. Mostly it's bills. Sometimes it's a coded warning that in several months I'll almost forget to buy a wedding present for someone. The best case scenario is that I've merely slid a little further into emotional debt to a faithfully corresponding family member. Good news arrives electronically. Duties are printed on paper, like military orders.</p>
<p>I tried to at least dispense with the bills. Bank of America made it seem like I could plausibly receive and pay bills online. When they added a feature that allowed me to automatically respond to incoming bills — no attention or volition required! — I enthusiastically handed my checkbook over to a robot. I spent the last 8 months or so throwing away every communication that looked even a little bit like it was from a credit card company. Sometimes I'd tear them up (identity thieves lurk everywhere!) but it was more satisfying to shove their evil, glossy bulk straight into the trash can. It was a wonderful time in my life. I felt free.</p>
<p>Sadly, I'm now putting my shackles back on. Several-too-many completely unexpected and alarmingly large credit card bills have proven to me that automatic bill payment is too erratic to trust. I'm sure that some day it'll be possible not to have to worry about debts on a near-daily basis. But I'm now convinced that it'll only happen after Star Trek-style collectivism finally kicks in and does away with currency altogether.</p>

<p>Following in the footsteps set last week by carnival-attendance pioneer <a class="reference external" href="http://silbatron.com/?p=211">Michael Silberman</a>, this Saturday a small group of daring adventurers set out for the Montgomery County Fair. The results were well-documented.</p>

<div class="line">One of the best things about almost being a <a class="reference external" href="http://dcist.com/authors.php?author=dcist_tom">fake journalist</a> is</div>
<div class="line">that it occasionally affords me invitations to fake press events.</div>
<div class="line">They're not all that fake, I guess — like all such events, they're</div>
<div class="line">trying to attract favorable coverage. But they're a little more shameless</div>
<div class="line">about it than they would be were they pitching writers with a sense of</div>
<div class="line">professional self-respect. This works out better for everyone involved.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Last Friday this translated into an invitation to Chevrolet's &quot;Re/v It</div>
<div class="line">Up&quot; event. They've been holding these things all over the</div>
<div class="line">country; DC was the last stop. Racing fans and their beleaguered mates</div>
<div class="line">travel from miles around to drive Chevy Cobalts (as seen at Hertz!)</div>
<div class="line">through a sea of orange traffic cones. Participants' scores are</div>
<div class="line">calculated relative to the time posted by a professional driver who runs</div>
<div class="line">the course several times a day. At the end the top scorers from each city are flown in and compete head-to-head for a new Corvette.</div>
</div>
<p>I'm not exactly sure why they invited me — I don't know or write about cars, but somehow I've ended up on Chevy's press list. It's either not a very big list or, more likely, one that few people respond to: the media turnout for the event totalled about 8 people — and that's including a few VIPs who were rolled into our group for its line-skipping abilities. The participant that came closest to representing an august general-interest publication was from <em>Washington Hispanic</em>.</p>
<p>I took the Metro out to Fedex field, which was a big mistake. The Morgan Boulevard Metro station, like all above-ground Metro stations, was located principally to justify the creation of a godawful tract housing development. It was only when workers were plugging in the turnstiles that someone finally looked up and noticed an enormous football stadium looming in the distance — one that tens of thousands of people would want to attend on a regular basis.</p>
<p>As a result it's kind of a hike to the stadium, and it was even further to get to the corner of the parking lot where Chevy had set up. The day was hot, and I was soaked in sweat by the time I got there. They gave me a badge, waved me through and immediately began distracting me with a stratospherically hot (and, one presumes, equally evil) PR rep. She gave me water, laughed at a couple of my dumb jokes and congratulated me on riding public transportation in a manner usually reserved for developmentally disabled adults.</p>
<p>Eventually an artificially genuine-seeming media liaison named <a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/1082554185/in/set-72157601367709626/">Dan</a> showed up and led us to the &quot;Rules &amp; Regulations&quot; tent, where a bored failed racecar driver explained to us what not to do. First on the list of proscribed activities: thinking that Chevy isn't awesome! Variations on this point consumed about two-thirds of his presentation. The only actual rules I remember hearing:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>No spinning tires at the start line — although a later instructor told us that we should probably spin them sort of a little, but not too much(!) because that'd make us go slower.</li>
<li>In what I presume is a nod to the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/02/AR2007060201293.html">Unifest unpleasantness</a>, we were forbidden from hitting any cones, and threatened with a two-second penalty <em>per cone</em> should we violate this rule. Except on the practice track, of course, where we could cream as many cones and/or street festival attendees as we'd like.</li>
</ol>
<p>Next were the instruction tents, where Dan the Media Guy introduced us to a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/1082560203/in/set-72157601367709626/">grizzled driver</a> who had &quot;done it all&quot;, which in this case means he's driven various cars on tracks both circular and straight. &quot;He lost the original Cannonball Run by twenty minutes! The original one, the real one!&quot; Dan repeated this factoid several times, perhaps after being disappointed by the lack of revery it initially inspired. I didn't and still don't really know what it meant, except perhaps that I was standing near someone who had once met Burt Reynolds.</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/1082560203/"><img alt="one of the instructors" class="center" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1276/1082560203_8adba40315.jpg" style="width: 375px; height: 500px;" /></a></p>
<p>Introductions dispensed with, we began receiving instruction. Over the next 45 minutes or so we learned a new and completely bewildering take on physics — one shaped by experience on the track, and one that I'm sure works fine as a set of heuristics, but also one that bears very little resemblance to everything I've ever been taught about how the physical world operates.</p>
<p>You've got your contact patches and apex points, of course, and the hilarious and heavily-stressed technique of &quot;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.tcsracing.org/oculardrivingtips.htm">ocular driving</a>&quot; — which, yes, means that while driving you should <em>use your eyes</em>. But these are just jargon laid atop a more fundamental philosophy. The racing experience is explained in terms of a sort of motorsport panpsychism. <em>Everything</em> is anthropomorphized, and your progress down the track is recast as a complicated negotiation between the animistic spirits of the asphalt, tires, engine and brakes. The driver's will seems to have very little to do with it (which, to be fair, is pretty accurate in my case).</p>
<p>I left the tent confused, but in the mood to drive recklessly. We headed to the practice course and did a few laps — it was a slightly deflated loop with tight turns and a slalom section. I didn't kill any cones or people. From there we headed to the competition course, where we donned hairnets and fantastically stupid-looking helmets (see above) and took two timed laps around the track, competing against one another.</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/1083532902/"><img alt="leaderboard detail" class="center" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1177/1083532902_5a03914f8f.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: 320px;" /></a></p>
<p>So alright, I didn't win. But hear me out: of the three people from the media group finishing ahead of me, one was a correspondent from <a class="reference external" href="http://www.mpt.org/motorweek/">Motorweek</a>, one was a professional racecar driver(!), and one was, uh, well, just better than me. But I'm pleased to report that I kicked the hell out of the 80 year-old guy from the Chinese-American Travel Association. All things considered, I'm pretty pleased with my performance. If you own a car and would like me to do terrible things to your brakes and tires, I stand ready.</p>
<p>I could've stuck around and tried the go-karts or drag-racing or ignite-the-open-vat-of-gasoline booth. Or talked to the &quot;NOS Energy Girls&quot;, I suppose. But I was ready to head home. On the way back I took a wrong turn, saw a fox and ended up in an overgrown cul de sac filled with weeds and Dharma Initiative-ish billboards emblazoned with the word JERICHO, but other than that the trip back was fine. I ended the day sweaty, exhausted and in posession of some extremely tacky Chevy promotional gear.</p>
<p>All in all, it was an overwhelming success. Car racing is almost as fun as it is stupid.</p>

<p>Well, it had a good run, persisting through discoloration, chipped glass and the occasional vinegar cleaning. But it looks like my venerable coffeemaker has shed its mortal coil at last. He perked once or twice this morning, but then: terrible, terrible silence.</p>
<p>We were reduced to brewing the morning coffee with Charles' French press. I know that some of my sophisticated big-city friends may be tempted to go on and on about the merits of French-pressed coffee — its thickness, sweetness and exquisite and/or non-existent oiliness — and from there argue that I should embrace French pressing as the one true way to make coffee. But as far as I'm concerned the single most important attribute that a cup of coffee can possess is not being the last one. And on that score, the French press fails. Besides, it sounds oddly sexual.</p>
<p>So, sad as this occasion is, it's also a chance for rebirth. I'm going to get a new coffeemaker, and I could use some suggestions. As you might imagine, my natural inclination is to get something complicated and impractical that costs a lot of money and breaks almost immediately. I've already asked some of my friends and loved ones to repeat to me that this is a bad idea, but I could use your support as well.</p>
<p>It would be nice to hear about specific alternate coffeemakers, too. Emily's trying to sell me on a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Bunn-NHBX-B-Contemporary-10-Cup-Coffee/dp/B000FFQ4TG/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/002-0057764-8465667?ie=UTF8&amp;s=home-garden&amp;qid=1186849531&amp;sr=8-1">Bunn</a> coffeemaker — her family has one that she likes a lot. But to me, the brand recalls the time when my mom was a church secretary and I'd sometimes have to while away time in the building's basement, with the folding chairs and blank marriage certificates and brittle linoleum and alcoholics shuffling into a room down the hall and, yes, Bunn coffeemaker. That's not really the coffee lifestyle I want my purchase to evoke. The machines are also a little pricey for appliances that come with so much suburban despair attached.</p>
<p>No, as with all of my consumer purchases, I'd like my coffeemaker to come from the not-too-distant future (post-flying cars, pre-zombies), or, failing that, Asia. I'm thinking clean lines, stainless steel, and perhaps polyphonic ringtones and/or a blood pressure cuff.</p>
<p>I'd also sort of like to get one with a thermal carafe. People seem to like the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Zojirushi-EC-BD15-Thermal-Carafe-Coffee/dp/B0000X7CMQ/ref=pd_sbs_hg_5_img/002-0057764-8465667?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1186849531&amp;sr=8-2">Zojirushi EC-BD15</a>, and I certainly like pronouncing it. But I'm given pause by the relatively lukewarm reviews for the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Zojirushi-EC-BD15BA-Stainless-Thermal-Carafe/dp/B0001WDFBS/ref=pd_bbs_4/002-0057764-8465667?ie=UTF8&amp;s=home-garden&amp;qid=1186865140&amp;sr=8-4">EC-BD15BA</a> which is, as far as I can tell, completely identical except for having a slightly larger illustration on Amazon.com.</p>
<p>So I'm not quite sure how to proceed. If anyone's used a Zojirushi, owned a Zojirushi, or had a loved one horribly disfigured by an explosion of steam and shrapnel coming from a Zojirushi, please let me know. And if you can make a case for a different brand or absolutely essential feature, lay it on me.</p>

                    <p>It's only Wednesday, but it's already been kind of an intense week. You may have noticed me failing to respond quickly by email, help you migrate your hotmail contacts, or join you in watching movies in which David Bowie magically inconveniences teens. I apologize. There's a deadline looming, and consequently I'm wasting a lot less time on the internet and elsewhere than I'd like. But I can still dimly recall a time when my life wasn't solely devoted to building doomed UGC also-rans.</p>
<p>And part of that time was spent at Six Flags, as <a class="reference external" href="http://www.movering.com/node/407">Emily</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://silbatron.com/?p=210">Michael</a> already recounted. I really had no idea that a bona-fide amusement park was accessible by DC public transportation. The last time I went to the park it was still called &quot;Wild World&quot; and didn't have much in it except a single wooden coaster and a lot of bored birthday party attendees.</p>
<p>Things have improved since then. If the rollercoaster and hour-long medical drama industries are any indication, humans really enjoy the sensation of finding out that they're not going to die after all. In fact, the only sensation they seem to enjoy more is learning that somebody else <em>is</em>, or at least is about to have a very bad time (this is why there are more crime procedurals than hospital dramas). Under Dan Snyder's thoughtful/big-spending leadership, the park has recognized this first important truth and blossomed into a wonderland of not-quite-deadly steel contraptions.</p>
<p><em>Superman: Ride of Steel</em> was probably the best coaster we went on, although the still-unridden Batman attraction seemed to break down with enough frequency that I think it must be particularly fun. The <em>Tower of Doom</em> was also pretty great: it just picks you up and drops you, cutting out the artifice and leaving riders strangely silent as they shuffle toward the exit.</p>
<p>The service left a little to be desired. It seemed like every employee had reported for orientation that morning — the atmosphere of the place can be summed up by the phrase, &quot;Oh, <em>that's</em> what that button does!&quot; This was mostly fine, though, as it meant that the employees were less beaten down by their awful summer jobs than one might expect. Tempers briefly flaired when it became apparent that each $25 cheese pizza ordered at the Papa John's counter was going to be meticulously made to order. Otherwise, all was well.</p>
<p>So I've got to give Six Flags a thumbs up. The lines were short, the beer was merely ballpark-priced and the waterpark had relatively few free-floating bandaids. Oh, and hey! I took some pictures:</p>

                    <p>Not to be a scold, but after yesterday I think I should emphasize: you might want to try to avoid getting migraines. I knew something strange was happening when the screen started swimming and I couldn't properly string together words for an IM conversation with <a class="reference external" href="http://cyrusfarivar.com/blog/">Cyrus</a>. This was mostly just confusing and interesting — I've been fascinated by aphasias, agnosias and other functional deficits ever since since I learned the <a class="reference external" href="http://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/chvision.html">blind spot trick</a>. But from there things quickly descended into a dull ache exacerbated by attempts to read. I finally gave up and went home, where a nap more or less set things right. But the back left side of my brain still felt worn out for the rest of the night, like the strip of grass in the middle of a soccer field.</p>
<p>Fortunately, this was unusual — I can only feel sorry for the folks afflicted with migraines on a chronic basis. In my case I can only conclude it was caused by — what else? — suspicious, out-of-the-ordinary coffee. I know, I know; even I'm having a hard time believing that explanation at this point. But I'm really at a loss for what else it could be.</p>

                    <p>Ladies and gentlemen, the Porters. We're freshly back from Andy and Lee Ann's wedding in lovely Winchester, Va. The bride was radiant, the groom was handsome, and no fights broke out. Well, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/757216202/">almost</a> no fights.</p>
<p>This wedding is sort of a milestone for my group of friends, I suppose. It's certainly not the first, but I think it is the first that didn't owe part of its timing to a pending deployment to Afghanistan, an INS scam or a raging Mormon libido. Not that those aren't all fine reasons to push up the date of nuptuals, but none of them apply to me, particularly. As far as I could see, though, this whole operation was uncoerced! Weird.</p>
<p>A <a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/757253254/">beautiful setting</a> and an awesome band made for a fun reception. Then everyone came back to the hotel and got drunk in our room, which was also pretty great. And about an hour ago I wrapped things up by buying an ionic air purifier off the registry: an electronic gadget the coolness of which is only outstripped by its potential uselessness. It's exactly the sort of gift I'd like to be associated with, and a storybook ending to the weekend. I hope it brings them many a happy ion.</p>

<p>Ah, frisbee golf — or, more properly, &quot;disc golf&quot;, as it's called by people sufficiently obsessed with it that Whammo suing one of their clubs or tournaments is a real possibility. Charles and I used to play all the time in high school, along with Jeff, Chris, Jon and Mark Zuckerman and whoever else was handy. It was cheap, vaguely outdoorsy and pretty fun. And <a class="reference external" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=l&amp;view=text&amp;q=601+noth+manchester+street&amp;near=Arlington,+VA&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hl=en&amp;latlng=38873065,-77134417,6954809954099064469&amp;ei=g4OORuaGOorerQK_op20AQ&amp;cd=1">Bluemont</a> has one of the best courses in the area, although the first three holes are a bit overgrown at the moment. Head over to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.casualadventure.com/index2.shtml">Casual Adventure</a>, pick up a couple of discs and go play. It's only approximately as dorky as you think. Avoid the weird middle-aged dudes sporting frisbee bags and invitations to their mothers' basements and you'll have a pretty good time.</p>

                    <p>They're all over the goddamn place. I'd like to flatter myself by thinking that this is due to the collection of healthy fruits and vegetables that I keep near my desk, making it the workstation in the office that could most easily be confused for a picnic. In truth, it probably has more to do with the heaps of disordered crap and abundant coffee stains that adorn it (FACT: ants are apparently attracted to Charlottesville property tax forms for cars you no longer own).</p>
<p>Lee family wisdom holds that the proper way to deal with ants is to sprinkle boric acid all over the damn place. It's apparently quite deadly to ants, but was invented long ago, well before anyone had come up with the idea that chemicals might be bad for humans. So it's perfectly safe to liberally douse, say, newborn infants with it in order to afford some anti-ant protection.</p>
<p>Unfortunately boric acid — like laudanum, sulfuric acid and egg cremes — appears to be one of those awesome substances that drug stores used to sell back in the day, but have since ceased to carry in order to free up more shelf space for Swisher Sweets and NASCAR-themed bags of Cracker Jack. So I'm stuck with more contemporary ant remediation options, which suck pretty badly. In the past I've tried the little black plastic gadgets with gobs of poisoned peanut butter in them. They seem to work, but only after months of patient watchfulness — I think it amounts to ant asbestos, only manifesting its deadliness ant-years after the initial exposure, and well after they've already produced offspring. I suspect that it's actually a breakdown in ant society caused by skyrocketing healthcare costs that makes the stuff work at all. Alternately, it may just be that winter rolls around and they decide that the whole exchange has been so embarrassing that they'd prefer to bother a more dignified target come springtime.</p>
<p>The situation is further compounded by our office's general eco-friendliness. We do a bunch of work for a prominent purveyor of environmentally-focused household products. I have no idea what their anti-ant products are — tiny, alluring decoys shaped like lady ants and made out of hemp, perhaps? A book printed in soy ink on recycled paper entitled &quot;Living with Ants&quot;? — but I'm terrified that if I raise a stink I might be forced to use them.</p>
<p>It's not so bad. They only bite a little.</p>

                    <p>It's been a pretty enjoyable, laid-back weekend. An early night on Friday, a leisurely Saturday afternoon and an extremely fun night out in SW and on H Street — we haven't even gotten to the Sopranos finale yet, but I'm prepared to declare the weekend a success.</p>
<p>It got off to kind of a rough start on Friday, though, as the universe seemed determine to tell me I'm over the hill. Sommer and I went to a party for Ramya, who in addition to being smart and wonderful is a few years younger than us. Our fellow guests were keen to congratulate us on dragging our geriatric selves out to a gathering of young people. Said one: &quot;Man, I'm pretty young and this party makes me feel old. You must feel <em>really</em> old.&quot; Said another: &quot;You're leaving? Yeah, I understand. This party is pretty young.&quot;</p>
<p>For the record, we ducked out early because we'd both had such AWESOME YOUNG-PERSON-TYPE TIMES the preceding weeknights and, uh, wanted to go home and go to sleep. And I'm fine with that! Still, it didn't help that when Charles and I checked out at the same Trader Joe's cashier he got carded but I didn't.</p>
<p>For the record, I remain relatively young and vital, and am prepared to take unwise risks and have opinions about MTV. As long as I can be in bed by 11 while doing it.</p>

                    <p>Alright, so there haven't been any <em>particularly</em> noteworthy hijinks so far. That's okay. I feel relaxed, loaded up on vitamin D, and as if creativity is beginning to seep back into my brain. Or perhaps that's just the sensation of the juniper deposits left by all the gin.</p>
<p>Either way, things are going great. My only complaint so far: deadly sea creatures.</p>

<p>It's a little hard to see, but this is a dead pufferfish. Evolution has graced him with highly effective camouflage, allowing him to trick his prey into stepping on him, then cursing.</p>
<p>The fact that he's A) too small to eat me and B) dead brings the effectiveness of this hunting technique into question, but I'm sure nature will iron things out in another eon or two. In the meantime, he did manage to draw some blood:</p>

<p>But between my vacationmates' sunburns and other miscellaneous ailments, I'm still doing relatively well at dealing with the beach's terrible toll.</p>

                    <p>I am, let's face it, a little hungover. The City Veins show last night was a lot of fun, but the accompanying revelry has left me a little worse for wear. I've already consumed a number of pills of some sort and waited patiently for someone to make me some coffee, but it appears that too many of my coworkers are off doing less important things (e.g. meeting with clients) for this to happen on its own. I still feel lousy.</p>
<p>This leaves food as the only possible solution. But my office staples of corn muffins, yogurt and fruit are at a calculated pre-beach ebb. I would have to get up and leave the office.</p>
<p>But there is this:</p>

<p>I could do it. I could drink this recently-acquired bottle of maple syrup.</p>
<p>It's really sugary — it'd probably even work.</p>

<li>I need to wriggle out of my T-Mobile contract. Well, one of them: I long ago escaped the one associated with my Sidekick, but I bought a separate number for DCist's LastCall service. LastCall's currently shut down due to some technical problems, and if I resurrect it I'd want to use a different SMS gateway. But I've still got over a year left on the contract.
Of course, there's a $200 early termination fee associated with quitting now. Bad. But T-Mobile has announced an SMS rate increase, which constitutes a contract change, which lets customers quit for free! Good! But I have unlimited SMS, so I don't qualify. Back to bad. Now I have to keep calling their CSRs until I get one that's especially sweet and/or confused.
I suppose I should feel guilty about my planned deceit, but I didn't get a handset when I signed up, and the ETF is largely in place to ensure that people don't get subsidized phones and then quit the service before the money's earned back. So my conscience is clear — it's just the sweet-talking that I'm dreading. Sage advice on this point would be appreciated.</li>
<li>I'm with Julian on <a class="reference external" href="http://juliansanchez.com/notes/archives/2007/05/was_this_article_written_by_a.php">this</a>: two dollars per cocktail seems very high. I am, I know, out of the mainstream when it comes to bar tipping: I've never really understood why bartenders are the best-compensated wait staff in a bar or restaurant when their jobs also seem to be the easiest and most fun. Besides, applying the same percentage (or higher) tip as when dining makes no sense: for drinks, the amount of effort the server has to invest in serving you is much smaller relative to the value of the total transaction (and therefore the tip) — the customer has to line up and wait to be served, there's generally no follow-up attention paid by the bartender, and less knowledge of the menu is required.
I suppose I feel this way because I prefer to drink cheap beer in dive bars. At Southwark a dollar tip per drink seems low — the gentleman on the other side of the bar prepared the beverage with such diligence, made such friendly, intelligent conversation and generally took such good care of me that it'd be incredibly crass not to tip generously in gratitude. But being expected to cough up a dollar per popped-top on $4 cans of Schlitz at DC9? I donno, man. Seems kinda dumb.</li>

                    <p>Wow. Friday night was incredibly impressive. <a class="reference external" href="http://www.badmintonstamps.com/">Josh</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.movering.com">Emily</a> and Lee decided to throw a party at a bowling alley in the basement of a church community center.

There's a less-biased writeup <a class="reference external" href="http://ohmurderinc.blogspot.com/2007/05/ok-here-i-go.html">here</a> (some photos, too).</p>
<p>I don't know if it's just a lingering effect of my Big Lebowski ascii art project, but it seems that I really enjoy taking photos of silhouetted figures bowling. So, uh, sorry about that.

<p>In other news, I'm kind of exhausted. This weekend has involved 450 miles of travel (spread over four legs) and a grand total of seven scheduled events. All but one of those involved drinking, so I suppose I shouldn't really complain. Yet I'm clearly doing it anyway — sorry about that.</p>
<p>But right now I have an hour to myself, a sunny couch to lie on, and the presumably-excellent <em>Chronicles of Riddick</em> on TV. Time to upload some photos and begin the process of forgetting to do my timesheet. Ahh, Sunday.</p>

                    <p>As you may recall, I have something of an ongoing quest to amass as many unpleasantly geeky traits as possible, in order to get a head start on horrifying any teenage offspring that my distant future may hold. A selection from the current list of accomplishments:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>extensive soldering iron evangelism</li>
<li>familiarity with both Palladium and TSR roleplaying game systems, including the ability to ruminate at length on the relative utility of twelve-sided die versus a d100</li>
<li>computers: I like 'em!</li>
<li>near-total incompetence at all team sports</li>
<li>and of course, the backgrounds in videogames and comics that are de rigeur for a male of my generation</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a few glaring omissions: I've never played a collectible card game like Magic: The Gathering; I've never been to a sci-fi convention or Renaissance Faire (although I think I deserve partial credit for attending multiple computer shows); and I have, in fact, seen a girl naked (not sure what to do about that one).</p>
<p>Still, I'm pleased to announce additional progress. Yesterday I received a package containing the first truly dorky board game that I've owned. And when I say truly dorky, I mean it — this isn't some Risk bullshit. Captains of football teams play Risk! No, this is a different sort of thing all together.</p>
<p>Jeff introduced me to the genre when he came home for Christmas, bringing the game <a class="reference external" href="http://www.riograndegames.com/">Puerto Rico</a> with him. I found it immediately appealing: its tendency to facilitate offensive jokes about colonialism and capacity for screwing over your fellow man made it a lot of fun. Then when I visited Jeff in California this spring we played <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Grid_(board_game)">Power Grid</a>, which I liked even more (and which, with its economically-oriented gameplay elements, seemed like it would be enjoyable to a lot of people I know).</p>
<p>But Jeff convinced me that I'd be better served by starting off with a simpler game. So I bought <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcassonne_%28board_game%29">Carcassonne</a>, which is considered a prototypical example of this so-called <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German-style_board_game">German-style board game</a> (presumably because the game revolves around divvying up real estate in France).</p>
<p>Some of you have probably heard of or even played it before — the only game from this genre that's better-known is <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settlers_of_Catan">Settlers of Catan</a>, which is popular enough to have <a class="reference external" href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/2007/05/04">shown up on Xbox Live</a>. But Carcassonne was new to me when <a class="reference external" href="http://dccharles.blogspot.com">Charles</a> and I gave it a try last night. The verdict: pretty fun!</p>
<p>But I can already feel the hunger growing — this one won't keep me satisfied for long. I need more tiles! More complex rules! More numerous and varied bits of varnished wood to lose under the couch! Things could get ugly before it's all over.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>It's been a few weeks since tax day, and that means my time is short. In a very little while my knowledge of and attention to my finances will transform back into a pumpkin, returning to its default state: quarterly comparisons of my checking balance and bar tabs to determine whether I should be drinking less, more, or much more (there are some discontinuities in the function).</p>
<p>I really, really hate dealing with money. It stresses me out, leaving me irritable and petty. Online bill payments have made my life significantly better, so much so that I've completely surrendered myself to them. For a while I insisted on manually responding to electronic bills. Then I automated known outgoing payments like rent. Then I set things up to automatically pay incoming bills. These days I'm perfectly happy to hand my SSN and a cheek swab over to even the shadiest vendor's auto-payment system. So what if they route payments through a Nigerian goldenpalace.com subsidiary with an expired SSL certificate? I don't care. I just want to be left alone until someone tells me I'm supposed to appear in court.</p>
<p>But like I said, I'm still in the midst of one of my financial waking periods, and I should probably seize the moment. I know it's uncouth to complain about not knowing what to do alllll one's vast estates and holdings. But, like a musician who can't help recording a sophomore album about how there's a downside to fame (man), I can't resist. The fact is that once, a long time ago, I was capable of saving money. For a while, I did so. The result was not a princely sum by any means, but enough that I should probably figure out something to do with it: partly because I may someday have expenses beyond electronics, beer and rent; but mostly because I'm tired of Bank of America employees stifling laughs and avoiding eye contact whenever I walk by one of their branches.</p>
<p>The obvious answer is to invest it somewhere. But where? And how? It's tempting to fritter it all away on hand-picked stocks, but a long-gone intern's incessant prattling about his portfolio convinced me that E*Trade's potential for turning me into an insufferable ass makes it an undesirable investment vehicle.</p>
<p>Besides, I remember the lesson taught to me by my ECON101 instructor (author of economic mystery novel <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Fatal-Equilibrium-Marshall-Jevons/dp/0345331583/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/103-3660562-2811854?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1178033693&amp;sr=8-1">The Fatal Equilibrium</a> — yes, really): no matter what you think you know, the market already knows it and has priced itself to reflect it. Got a hunch? The market's on to you. Heard a hot tip? The market did, too. Did you just invent a cheap &amp; effective robot bride at a secret facility buried deep within the earth's crust? Sorry weirdo, the market was hiding in the ductwork and has already radioed the news back to the trading floor. Even if you caught it, it'd just crush the cyanide-filled false molar implanted in its jaw before you could get any information from it.</p>
<p>So the thing to do, apparently, is to find an index fund, which lets you spread your investment across the top 500 or 1000 stocks in various segments of the market. This strategy gets around the problem of your not being very good at picking stocks AND the problem of professional stock-pickers not being very good at picking stocks.</p>
<p><img alt="Erin from esurance.com" class="right" src="/static/2007/05/01/20070501_esurance_erin.jpg" style="width: 145px; height: 186px;" />All I really have to do is find somebody who's willing to sell me one of these things, then pick one. Figuring out which business to hire has proven unusually difficult, however. My tried &amp; true method for this sort of thing is to find the firm with the best cartoon mascot. For example, if I was still in the market for car insurance I'd obviously have to give my business to the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.esurance.com">creators</a> of sexy cartoon minx <a class="reference external" href="http://www.slate.com/id/2154026/?nav=navoa">Erin</a>, who periodically fights robotic menaces with an unnamed animated lummox (can't you see he's all wrong for you, Erin!?).</p>
<p>But things aren't as clear-cut in the financial arena. The closest thing to a cartoon that I can think of are these Charles Schwab commercials that rip off <em>Waking Life</em>:</p>
<p><img alt="still from a charles schwab commercial that apes the visual style of waking life/scanner darkly" class="center" src="/static/2007/05/01/20070501_charlesschwab.jpg" style="width: 445px; height: 332px;" /></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=ete3p0AQf98&amp;mode=related&amp;search=">Counteraguments aside</a>, I decided to give it a shot. But it's hopelessly confusing. There are <em>tons</em> of funds. And although they're rated with a varying number of stars along just a few axes (in order to assist stupid people like myself), the overall risk/reward relationship doesn't appear to be zero-sum. This leaves me wondering why anyone wouldn't just pick the one with the best combination of stars — and why it's so hard to use the interface to find that one (maybe this is why investment bankers are so well-paid). Until I figure out the answers to these questions I'm too terrified to do anything.</p>

                    <p>Let me preface this by saying that I am sorry to be writing it. There is nothing I wish for more than our people to live in mutual prosperity and comity. However, I feel that I can no longer remain silent.</p>
<p>It's an open secret that there are one or more undocumented mice living in this apartment. Although the arrangement is kept off the books, most of us adopt a live-and-let-live attitude with regard to it. You perform the vital burrowing and crumb-removal jobs that other apartment residents are unwilling or too large to do. In return we forbid our friend Jon from bringing his snakes over when he visits. The arrangement works well: perhaps someday your children will be able to live a better life as detectives, professional rescuers, or confidantes to exiled princesses. I'm even willing to fund the training and tiny anthropomorphic articles of clothing that they'll need to pursue these dreams.</p>
<p>But let's be frank: our peoples have something of an uneasy truce. You're here whether I like it or not. Everyone knows that proposals to build better walls or do the dishes in a timely manner are little more than the lunatic ravings of the Pat Buchanans and Lou Dobbs of the world. But just because we can't get rid of you doesn't mean we can't make your life <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falconry">more difficult</a>. It's in your best interest to work with us, not against us.</p>
<p>To be blunt, the events of the past 24 hours have been a grave breach of our unspoken covenant. You are not on the lease, and consequently you are not entitled to collect the services that are available to other apartment residents — in this case, mortuary services. We're not running some rodent hospice here, you know.</p>
<p>In the future, please ensure that your loved ones expire somewhere off the premises, or at the very least not in my room. Further, in the event of an accidental death on-premises I require prompt notification — preferably by email (and in an appropriately apologetic tone). Finally — and I can't stress this enough — <em>embalming or cremation must be conducted promptly</em>.</p>
<p>I am sure that this must be a difficult time for the family of the individual in question. Nevertheless, I must demand your prompt consideration and immediate compliance with these directives.</p>
<p>Oh yeah! I'm not issuing any more driver's licenses, either. I don't care what Geraldo said on O'Reilly.</p>

And if I'm not getting any, why am I doing my taxes now, instead of at 11:45 pm on April 14?</p>
<p>This is the first year I haven't gotten a refund. New job, yes, but default withholding, I thought. I guess the addition of a 401(k) really fucked me over. It was not, presumably, the whopping $28 in dividends that the lingering shreds of my college mutual fund delivered.</p>
<p>I guess this means my dreams of HDTV ownership will once again be delayed. At least I've got that thirty dollar refund from D.C. That should cover, oh, about half of the cost of doing my taxes on H&amp;R Block's website — something else that I've never had to pay for before.</p>
<p>Man. Doing my taxes used to be a lot more fun.</p>

                    <p>Well, I remain sick and miserable. Eleven or twelve hours' worth of sleep didn't do much to improve things (although I am at least a little less confused), but my body is still a distinctly unpleasant place to be. I've had enough — it's time to find a doctor and get some goddamn antibiotics. I've been a very good boy when it comes to not demanding superbug-breeding pharmaceuticals for minor illnesses, but this is too much. I'm calling in whatever credit I've built up.</p>
<p>The only problem is that I don't really have a doctor, per se. I put down a primary care physician for insurance purposes when I changed jobs, but I haven't actually been to see her. Some phone calls revealed that not only is she not open on weekends, but she's changed practices. That's a no-go.</p>
<p>And then there was the pleasantly confused old man I visited a few years back, who accidentally wrote me multiple prescriptions for what I have since been assured is an alarmingly powerful antibiotic. It would have been a promising route to pursue, but I don't remember his name and kind of doubt he'd take weekend appointments and/or still be alive.</p>
<p>So it was off to the Blue Cross website to find a nearby doctor. And I think I hit paydirt on the first search result. No fancy-pants weekend answering services for Dr. Akhigbe: judging by how confused he was at getting my call, I'm pretty sure I'd gotten him on his cell phone. I guess that's the sort of high-touch approach they teach at the University of Lagos.</p>
<p>Anyway, after the initial confusion and alarm at receiving my call had subsided, the doctor was extremely pleasant and helpful. &quot;I don't think I'll be in the office this morning, but I might be there in the afternoon,&quot; he said in a pronounced Nigerian accent. &quot;Why don't you try around three?&quot;</p>
<p>Why not indeed. So three it is, and I've got high hopes for cajoling some antibiotics out of him. Not only do my symptoms seem to actually be appropriate to a bacterial infection (it's like having a normal sore throat, except much less pleasant), but Dr. Akhigbe is, in addition to being a general practitioner, a pain specialist. Odds of me walking out of that office with a scrip for oxycontin just got ugraded from &quot;poor&quot; to &quot;fair&quot;.</p>

                    <p>I got an EVDO card for a long weekend from Verizon, then returned it. &quot;You'll be prorated,&quot; I was assured. I wasn't, and instead got charged a full month's fees for 4 days' worth of use.</p>
<p>I thought I'd paid it anyway, but maybe not. Either way, I eventually got a message from &quot;Miracle Financial&quot;. I returned their call and left a message asking for them to call me back and let me know what they were calling about. I had also gotten a call from another financial company on the same night, but that one was looking for someone else. I figured that some predatory lending agency had gotten my number on an industry-wide spam list, so after doing my part for our new game of phone tag I didn't think much else about it.</p>
<p>The next call I got was today, and came from an abusive gentleman who refused to let me leave the conversation in order to call Verizon. Instead he started yelling about my credit report (as if a $70 outstanding balance was going to put that dreamhouse of mine out of reach). &quot;We'll be calling you for seven years!&quot; he bellowed, which didn't make an awful lot of sense — I think the number comes from the years until an offense goes off your credit report, but who knows. I assume he does this all the time, so it must work despite the complete lack of sense.</p>
<p>I'm disinclined to feed money directly to people who call me up to yell at me, so I hung up on him and called Verizon. A maze of prompts later I get a human being, who told me that I couldn't talk to them about the issue — I'd have to talk to the collection guys. Of course, the collection guy had already told me that I can't talk to them about the incorrect charge, either. I just need to pay up, preferably by directly giving my credit card number to some lout who had called me out of the blue.</p>
<p>So I cut them a check. What else could I do? If a company decides you owe them money, they can simply refuse to listen to you or correct their mistake. Instead they'll pay some professional dickhead in Massachusetts to harass you by telephone until you give up. If that fails they'll tell every other corporation how terrible you are. Unless you're a lawyer with a lot of free time, there's not much you can do about it.</p>
<p>I remember many still, sunny Sunday mornings at UVA when the perfect awfulness of my hangover was wrenched into consciousness by an angry collections call. Not for me, of course — I'm actually surprisingly good at paying my bills, despite only opening my mail once a month or so. Instead it was for the people who had the phone number before me. They would tell me not to deny that I was [name other than my own], and strongly encourage me to settle my outstanding debt immediately. And they'd do with the same prerecorded call every time. I eventually had to track down the company responsible, call during business hours and politely ask them to shut the fuck up. To their credit, they did. Still, you have to wonder about what would drive someone into a career of professional unpleasantness.</p>
<p>Anyway, it's a lousy thing to have happen in the middle of your day, and all the more infuriating because these jerks don't even have a web presence for me to sheepishly submit my payment to — instead I had to speak to an actual person. I still refused to do anything other than mail them a check, but that didn't make me feel much better. Will polluting their nonexistent Google ranking help? Nah, probably not. But dammit, I have to try.</p>

I mean, yes, I have <a class="reference external" href="http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=706410178">a profile</a>. But as you may be able to tell from the listed interests, it's not much of a serious effort. I've been mildly horrified to see friend requests begin to roll in from people I know.</p>
<p>I just don't see the point. What's it supposed to do? Keep me <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rss">up to date</a> on my friends' activities? Let me <a class="reference external" href="http://flickr.com">post photos</a>? Or <a class="reference external" href="http://del.icio.us">share links</a>? Get <a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com">mobile updates</a>? <a class="reference external" href="http://www.evite.com">Plan</a> <a class="reference external" href="http://www.upcoming.org">events</a>? Bah! I've already got technologies that I use for all this stuff. There's no reason to reroute all that activity through the blue &amp; white blandness of a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22a%20Mark%20Zuckerberg%20production%22">cocky</a> <a class="reference external" href="http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=502722">thief</a>.</p>
<p>Alright, that's a little disingenuous. I can think of one reason: now that folks use the internet professionally, they probably now want to retreat into a lower-stakes setting. I guess I can understand that. But it still seems like a pain in the ass, and the idea of &quot;poking&quot; and giving $1 virtual gifts sends me into a blind rage.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I guess I should finish the point I intended to make. One of the things that Matt &quot;Wordpress&quot; Mullenweg said during his presentation at SXSW was that he foresaw the future of personalized online presences being grounded in individual online sites, not gigantic networks like Facebook and Myspace. Obviously he's got a vested interest in pushing this vision, but I agree with him: the big networks won't last forever. Right now they can offer ease-of-use and a critical mass of users that makes finding your friends easy. But they don't have a monopoly on the former (Wordpress and blogger are great counterexamples) and userbase size isn't an advantage that lasts forever — ask Friendster. The fad value of these sites will force the market to perpetually refactor itself, fragmenting a little more each time.</p>
<p>The logical end point is for everyone to be running their own relatively-open site, free from the shadow of corporate hosts. Open formats will let your site talk to everybody else's, keeping you apprised of what your friends are up to. It'll be great.</p>
<p>In fact, it already IS great, since our little bloggy universe already uses these technologies across our constellation of personal sites. That's why I think Facebook adoption is silly: it's a step backward.</p>
<p>With all of that said, I don't want to let pig-headedness cut me out of connectivity — I'm sure I'll put in a mild Facebook effort. But does it really not have RSS feeds?</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>I've got a bit of a reputation around the office for being completely useless and insufferable before I've had my first two or three cups of coffee. Although I'm not that bothered by this, I'm also not particularly pleased about it — I think that participation in the geek cult of caffeine is a fairly lame affectation, and I'd like to think that I can function without a chemical crutch. I haven't intentionally cultivated this reputation; I guess I've just accidentally been kind of mean to people.</p>
<p>But it's definitely true that I'm a better Tom when I have a few cups of coffee in me. I'm happier, smarter, and a <em>much</em> better writer — especially when I'm perched in that perfect spot between very- and too-caffeinated.</p>
<p>I don't think I'm much of a coffee snob, or at least I hope I'm not. I drink enough of the stuff (and take it unadorned) that I don't <em>taste</em> very much as I down it unless it's a particularly strong brew or has been burnt into sourness. And even if it has, I'll drink pretty much anything. I may talk excitedly about burr grinders and occasionally bring in bottles of vinegar to clean the office Mr. Coffee, but I'll happily suck down <a class="reference external" href="http://www.stereogum.com/archives/004889.html">Flavia</a>, too (so long as it isn't the flavored kind).</p>
<p>But the last couple of days have gotten me wondering about my brand. My all-time favorite is Trader Joe's house beans, which make me ecstatically wired and have most often done so when I'm working from home (this definitely helps build up positive associations). But at the office I'll drink whatever shows up in the kitchen. We've recently switched to this <a class="reference external" href="http://www.storyville.com/">Storyville</a> stuff, and the last few days I've found myself walking around in a foul-tempered funk. Each time a cup from Caribou cleared things right up, though, bringing me back to a relatively ebullient version of myself.</p>
<p>I know this is probably all psychosomatic. Still, it's a little weird. I've had <a class="reference external" href="http://www.zunta.org/blog/archives/2005/03/20/dont_eat_the_br/">extreme reactions</a> to particular coffee before (although in that case I sort of suspect that the stuff was tainted with a distinctly non-coffee ingredient). Other folks have theorized that Starbucks' popularity is due to its <a class="reference external" href="http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/20152/caffeine_nation_eyeopening_statistics.html">much higher caffeine levels</a> relative to other brands. And it's not as if caffeine is the only psychoactive chemical in coffee — there's theophylline, theobromine, and who knows how many others (<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maillard_reaction">partially burning food</a> creates lots of chemical variation ). Like <a class="reference external" href="http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/bb/neuro/neuro01/web2/Slaughter.html">chocolate</a>, there are probably a whole host of subtle physiological and psychological effects induced by coffee that aren't easy to consciously notice, but which contribute to how we use and perceive it. Is it unreasonable to think that different brands, blends and roasts may represent different ratios of these chemicals, and that they may induce varying affects? We've all heard people claim that tequila makes them crazy, or that gin gives them headaches, or that Jaegermeister makes them fight people. Right? Is it so crazy to think that this could happen, albeit on a smaller scale, with coffee?</p>
<p>The answer is almost certainly Yes, Tom, it's crazy to think that. The fact that you've been staying up late reading terrible <a class="reference external" href="http://www.marvel.com/comics/Civil_War">Civil War</a> comic books probably has a lot more to do with your foul moods over the last two days than anything you've had to drink. The difference is that fussing over coffee is more fun than not-reading-comics.</p>
<p>But now that I've convinced myself of this chemical curiousity — no matter how slightly — all hope of a rational explanation is gone. Until I settle on a similarly-magical countermeasure, I'll probably keep thinking that Storyville beans make me a jerk.</p>

                    <p>You're probably pretty sick of reading posts from me that start off by complaining about how far behind on everything I am. So am I, for what it's worth. But a lot happened over the course of the ten days when I was gone, and I feel like I need to sift through it if I'm ever going to return to the state of continuous partial attention that I left.</p>
<p>It's tempting to just hit &quot;mark all as read&quot; on every feed in my reader, but I'd be a real jerk if I didn't point out that my friends did a lot of cool stuff while I was gone (or while I was too busy preparing to leave to link to anything). So, a few plaudits. If I left your amazing accomplishment off, well, I guess I'm still a jerk. I promise I'll write about it as soon as I read about it.</p>

<li><p class="first"><a class="reference external" href="http://dccharles.blogspot.com/2007/03/weekend-affair.html">Charles recorded an album</a>! I got to witness the break-neck pace at which they threw this thing together. Their devotion to the process was impressive, but hearing Aaron sing the same apparently atonal chorus a million times left me gritting my teeth for an irritating final product. But I was pleasantly surprised — I think that this is the best stuff I've ever heard these two guys record (they collaborated with Bayes, but I've never heard anything he recorded). If you haven't gotten around to downloading the whole thing from Charles' site, here's a flash player that should let you pick and choose from the tracks. I'd suggest starting with track 7 — it's got a an impressively catchy (and New York-y) guitar hook that'll burrow straight into your cochlea and stay there.</p>

                    <p>Visiting Austin and California was great, but it's a relief to be home. The last ten days have been busy ones, and I'm feeling the effects. I did manage to finally kick my traditional month-long spring cold, but my shoes <a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/421204130/">weren't up</a> to the amount of walking that a party-filled conference and unexplored city demanded: my legs ache and I feel pretty worn down.</p>
<p>For a conference about the internet I spent surprisingly little time online: electrical outlets were precious commodities, and although the organizers made an admirable attempt, the Southby wifi left a lot to be desired. So I'm slowly, painfully reimmersing myself in the internet, as if it's a scalding-hot bath. Eventually I'll be relaxed, reengaged and recovered, but for right now the 1,324 unread RSS items staring at me from NetNewsWire are more than a little intimidating.</p>
<p>I've got to tie a few more things up over at the <a class="reference external" href="http://sxsw.echoditto.com">EchoDitto SXSW blog</a>, but later on I'll start putting stuff up here. For now, here's my collection of SXSW photos — I'll probably elaborate on the better ones later on, but at the moment I need to put these up so that I can steal the generated HTML and cross-post it to the EchoDitto blog.</p>

<p>So, I suppose I should have mentioned this earlier, but I'm on the verge of a delirious Western adventure. First! A week of vacation in California. Emily and I are headed to the bay area to hang out with <a class="reference external" href="http://www.jeffnye.org">Jeff</a>, Marie, Chris, Paul, Jon, my aunt &amp; uncle, and the hippies, weirdos, fortune-seekers and drug addicts that power the world's seventh-largest economy.</p>
<p>Second! It's back home via Austin, where we'll rejoin the EchoDitto crew at SXSW Interactive for some good old-fashioned internet fun. Needless to say if any readers, lurkers or inter-friends will be in either area you should send me an email. If you don't have my address, send a blank message to tom&#64;[this domain] to get the real one sent to you (consider it an experiment in spammer-foiling).</p>

<p>I had planned another round of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.manifestdensity.net/2007/02/02/sommer/">deluxe video labeling</a>, but given the way they cut it I don't think it's really worth the effort.</p>
<p>If you haven't seen any episodes of DoS before, I'd suggest <a class="reference external" href="http://www.channel102.net/view.php?epid=205">episode 4</a> as its current pinnacle so far (although you may need the exposition of episode 1 to figure out what the hell is going on).

I can deal with blogospheric neglect, but not its formalization. But if this is the way it's going to be, I'll at least console myself by indulging in a blogubituary.</p>
<p>Out of everyone in our little corner of the internet, I'd say that Susan managed to get closest to the dignified end of the quality–quantity continuum. But that's not to imply that I think we're playing in a zero-sum game, or on a level field. Do the math and you'll see that Sue could have pretty clearly become an blogospheric titan if only she'd cared to. But reading her site always left me feeling like she was writing it more out of an obligation to her talents than because she loved the medium (and the egocentric gratification it provides). She seemed like some foreign basketball prodigy swept out of rural obscurity and compelled to play a game that her heart wasn't in. If that analogy seems strained, consider that Susan is in fact quite tall.</p>
<p>I remain optimistic that this departure isn't permanent, or is perhaps just being made in favor of more pseudonymous pastures. Either way, do yourself a favor and go <a class="reference external" href="http://sueandnotu.blogspot.com/">page through some archives</a>.</p>

                    <p>So look, cut me some slack. It's been a rough week: between work trauma and being sick enough to miss a full day of work for the first time in I don't know how long, this wasn't very bloggy week for me. Well, not here, anyway; I was happy to pursue titillating inquiries into American Idol contestants over at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.dcist.com/archives/2007/02/23/the_districts_i.php">DCist</a>.</p>
<p>I <em>did</em> manage to fail to implement a cool webcam thing I was working on, as well as managing to not get Arcade Fire tickets (iCal reminders don't work, apparently). I know, quite a week.</p>
<p>But I didn't just sit around complaining! I did other things, too. Ever since <a class="reference external" href="http://www.jeffnye.org">Jeff</a> <a class="reference external" href="/2006/11/30/well-im-sick/#comments">told me</a> that my beloved zinc tables were probably destroying my brain I've been looking for a new pseudoscientific way to recover from colds. But nothing plausible and affordable had come along, and I was ill again — I found myself lowering my standards. I was getting sicker and more suggestible by the day.</p>
<p>That's when I heard <a class="reference external" href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=7108546&amp;ft=1&amp;f=3">this</a> NPR report. Nasal irrigation? Sure! Why not?</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/403040010/"><img alt="dr. somethingorother's nasal rinse" class="center" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/128/403040010_51bb3db5c0.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>So yes, the deal is that you squirt warm, salty water up your nose. And yes, I realize that this may seem kind of embarrassing and gross. But the NPR people made it sound great! I was convinced that if I took this one simple step I would feel refreshed and recovered; have a more resonant, stentorian voice; and might attain a new level of consciousness and/or be able to shoot bolts of energy from my fingertips. It'd be like Scientology, except available at CVS. At the very least I wouldn't have to sniffle and sneeze quite as much. That was the hope, anyway. But you don't have to take my word for these incredible benefits — just look how happy the girl on the box is:</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/403040609/"><img alt="a young girl with a nasal rinse bottle jammed up her nose. she seems happy" class="center" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/141/403040609_95b500a8d2.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Well, I tried it. The actual experience was less unpleasant than you might expect. But aside from the fulfillment of that promise, it's a total crock. I didn't feel any better immediately afterward, and the next day things had actually gotten quite a bit worse. Maybe I should have taken the box's entreaties that I boil the District's tap water a bit more seriously.</p>
<p>Anyway, it may be unrelated, but I currently have no sense of smell. It's a little weird — I can breathe perfectly normally, but I can't smell anything at all. Waving a bottle of scotch under my nose produces absolutely no effect, and I was only able to tell that I was in a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.philadelphiaweekly.com/view.php?id=12253">smoky bar</a> by virtue of my watering eyes.</p>
<p>I'm confident that my sense of smell will eventually come back, but for now it's sort of neat to be working solely off of my sense of taste. Things are salty, sweet, sour or bitter, and that's about it. Food's a little boring, but the cheapest booze at a bar now tastes the same as top shelf. Call it a wash.</p>

                    <p>Sick days: not as bad as they could be. It's true that I still sort of feel like I'm breathing through a tiny, phlegmy drinking straw. But there's a lot to be said for spending a day in your pajamas a scant few feet from a chocolate cake. Plus I got kind of a lot of work done. It's really made me miss the heady days of telecommuting to my considerably stupider but also more hygiene-optional last job.</p>
<p>But all's not well in the world. I'll issue this qualification: I really like the stuff that <a class="reference external" href="http://www.brightestyoungthings.com/">BYT</a>/<a class="reference external" href="http://www.myspace.com/garutachi">Garutachi</a> is doing — seems decidedly too cool for the likes of me, but I'm glad there's a distinct party scene in this city that's concerned with things other than <a class="reference external" href="http://wonkette.com/politics/last-week's-shots/">date rape and boat shoes</a>. Still, I wasn't pleased to see <a class="reference external" href="http://wonkette.com/photogallery/garutachi/">this</a>. I find it extremely depressing that the only thing still keeping DC safely out of <a class="reference external" href="http://gawker.com/news/blue-states-lose/">Blue States Lose</a> eligibility is the fact that we're not a state.</p>

<p>And thanks &amp; congratulations to Kyle and Amanda for putting the concert together. I'm consistently amazed that people I know manage to put together such great rock shows. Their ability to identify bands at the sweet spot between popularity and bookability; get people in the door; make them feel like they got their money's worth; and have the bands leave happy — well, it's impressive. And for sub-$10 shows, it's surprisingly rare.</p>

                    <p>Man, what a lousy start to the morning. To be fair, any morning that starts at 2:30 is probably going to be fairly crappy, but this one has some real staying power. I was awakened by a tap-tap-tapping on my chamber door. The last time this happened it was a cop who wanted to explain that he'd chased a suspect into my garage. Based on that experience it seemed like it was worth getting up. This time it was just my neighbor, who swept into the apartment and started fiddling with our thermostat. Apparently something in the building was vibrating annoyingly, and, as irresponsible young renters, Charles and I seemed like the sort of people who might ignore a problem until it involved shrapnel and scalding.</p>
<p>But it turned out that it wasn't our furnace at all — it was blowing its usual stream of frigid air throughout the nighttime apartment as reliably as ever. This happens every time it snows — the heat pump can't produce air hot enough to meet our modest-yet-optimistic thermostat setting, so the system just tries blowing the cold air <em>faster</em> in order to make up the difference. I appreciate the effort, but it's not much help.</p>
<p>The other annoyances have been more minor. There was the slog to work through unsalted sidewalks — well, except for the American Chemical Association's stretch of pavement, which is always immaculately clear (but also seems likely to be highly carcinogenic). And LastCall is <a class="reference external" href="http://www.dcist.com/archives/2007/02/14/lastcall_needs.php">throwing a fit</a>, requiring me to shut it down until I can locate a nasty bug and quash it.</p>
<p>But the biggest letdown is that our company sexual harassment training — which, yes, was scheduled for Valentine's Day — has been rescheduled due to the winter weather. I'm pretty bummed out; I had gone to a lot of effort separating candy hearts into &quot;workplace-safe&quot; and &quot;unacceptably sexual&quot; piles.</p>

<p>Some of these were judgment calls: &quot;my boy&quot; was on the line, but its assertion of possession (and racist undertones) ultimately led me to give it the axe. Similarly, &quot;dare ya&quot; seemed fairly non-sexual, but was discarded due to the high odds that it would set events in motion that could lead to worker's comp claims. But most of the objectionable hearts were easy to spot. &quot;Kiss me&quot;? &quot;So fine&quot;? You'd be astounded at the filth that Brach's gets away with.</p>
<p>As for the rest of the day... well, I'm not optimistic. The high availability of candy hearts in my workplace makes it likely that I'm going to be feeling very sick by the time I head home.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> The stupid cafe around the corner forgot to put stupid dolmadas in my stupid carryout Greek salad. I hate this universe.</p>

It's so sweet of you to notice!</p>
<p>I finally decided that this was the year to take the metaphorical plunge into boiling grease. For the past few [STRIKEOUT:Superbowls] — sorry, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2007_02/010677.php">&quot;Big Games&quot;</a> — I've made buffalo wings the godawful way: deep-frying chicken wings in a pot full of peanut oil, then tossing them with a delicious mixture of butter and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.texaspete.com/">Texas Pete</a>.</p>
<p>Although the wings usually turned out well, the process of making them was always disastrous. A combination of personal impatience, chicken wing frozen-ness and the laws of nature's unpleasant inflexibility generally resulted in a roiling mass of steam and oil clambering out of the pot and spreading itself in a thin layer over every surface in my kitchen. It was disgusting, hard to clean up, and seemed likely to eventually result in a trip to the hospital.</p>
<p>This, combined with Emily's sudden realization that she had a life-long aspiration to make corndogs, led us to Target last Saturday, where we considered their various deep-frying options. Most of the available fryers failed to inspire confidence. At the low-end of the market sat the chintzy Asian models, which looked like and probably were simple rice cookers with various important safety features removed. Their control dials also turned alarmingly freely, making it seem unlikely that they were connected to anything at all. At the other end of the market stood a much more expensive but even-chintzier American fryer. This one had the classic-looking rectangular basket and some impressively substantial knobs. But the rest of the device seemed pretty crappily made, like poorly-considered component of a PlaySkool fast-food-themed set of toys that had been hastily recalled, rebadged and resold.</p>
<p>That left just one remaining option, which was a little bit of a gamble since there was no display model. But ultimately the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/378745695/">Friteuse En Huile Profonde</a> seemed like the best idea. &quot;They were right about Iraq, after all,&quot; I thought. &quot;Maybe they'll be right about frying, too.&quot;</p>
<p>Sadly, upon returning home we discovered that the fryer was actually Canadian in origin. Other deficiencies became apparent, too: there was no temperature control, leaving aspiring fryers just one setting (&quot;poutine&quot;) with which to work.</p>
<p>But overall the device didn't disappoint. We made some french fries and they were good (although not as crispy as would've been ideal). Then we trekked over to the flophouse for the Superbowl and made some corndogs and wings. The corndogs were a huge success, but the wings were a little lacking — I didn't fry them as long as I should've, and the result was slightly soggy. Also, they left the wires of the frying basket covered in a disconcerting brown substance. It's probably just miscellaneous chicken gunk (their souls, maybe?), but it could also be that Giant adds chemicals to their chicken wings (&quot;18% broth by volume!&quot;) that can induce stainless steel to rust.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that's all the frying I've done since making the purchase. The oil was still too hot at the game's conclusion for the fryer to be moved. Besides, <a class="reference external" href="http://toohotfortnr.blogspot.com">Spencer</a> expressed some interest in becoming the fryer's foster father. It's for the best — as a single parent, I simply couldn't provide the sort of environment where a deep-fat fryer could really blossom. It'll ultimately be better off residing in a household where a lot of people care deeply for it — and don't mind every item they own smelling like french fries.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>Internet veterans may remember the heady days of December of two-thousand and aught-six. In those days an inter-meme spread through the web, cutting down many a blogger in a flurry of third-party-prompted self-absorption. The theme? List five things that people don't know about you.</p>
<p>Pretty much everyone I know — myself included — was afflicted, but the most interesting response came from Sommer, who <a class="reference external" href="http://cruelsommer.blogspot.com/2006/12/five-things.html">revealed</a> that she had been an extra in the movie adaptation of <em>Super Mario Brothers</em>. In her comments, I immediately swore to find and download the film.</p>
<p>And I did! But editing the video to highlight Sommer's contributions proved to be tougher than I had expected. It turns out that Apple's <a class="reference external" href="http://www.apple.com/ilife/imovie/">consumer-level</a> editing tools are great for making videos of, say, Steve Jobs' kids playing soccer, but are significantly less well-suited to highlighting your friend's performance in a confused early-nineties film adaptation of a popular videogame. I finally got the job done with <a class="reference external" href="http://www.parallels.com/">Parallels</a> and a couple of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.virtualdub.org/">ugly</a> but <a class="reference external" href="http://www.debugmode.com/wax/">powerful</a> (and free) Windows applications.</p>
<p>But before you click through to the video, let me set up the clip for you so as to best equip you to appreciate Sommer's performance. Cantankerous New York plumber Mario (Bob Hoskins) and his headstrong but well-meaning younger brother Luigi (John Leguizamo) were minding their own business... when they stumbled into a world beyond their imagination! Chasing after the kidnappers of a friend, the pair find themselves in the Mushroom Kingdom, a subterranean land and/or parallel dimension populated by human-like creatures of reptilian descent and ruled by the tyrannical King Koopa (Dennis Hopper). Koopa is determined to wage war on the human world and claim their plentiful natural resources. But how does the kidnapped Daisy (Samantha Mathis) fit into this fiendish plot? And — more to the point — how will Mario and Luigi save her?</p>
<p>The answer may lie with a mysterious woman in red (Francesca Roberts) and an even more enigmatic power crystal that she's come to possess. It is the singleminded pursuit of this crystal that drives Mario and Luigi in the scene.</p>
<p>As you watch it, consider Sommer's motivation. It's true that her character is unnamed, but in some respects this makes her role all the more universal and important. In a very real sense she represents the Mushroom Kingdom Everyman, living life under an oppressive regime that is all she's ever known. Despite her presumable ignorance of the human world, she must have a sense that something is deeply wrong with her own. The contradictions of a society technologically advanced enough to produce jump-boots yet unable to provide clean air and water are so profound that they will inevitably pervade its citizens' minds with dread, even as they — having never left their world's rotting subterranean embrace — can't quite name what's so desperately wrong, much less escape it. Instead, Sommer and her ilk are doomed — in a nearly Greek tragedian sense — to be storm-tossed by fate, unable to act even as powerful actors move through their midst (sometimes in the very same rooms!). All that she can do is seek panicked, choking respite in the grim, tomblike nightclubs of her dying world as she unknowingly waits for salvation — or the liberating release of death.</p>
<p>And, on a more Inside-The-Actor's-Studio sort of note, it's worth mentioning that the kidnapped Princess Daisy is played by Sommer's own sister. Immersed in the Method but still green to the trade and desperate to conceal sororial concern for someone that should be unknown to Sommer's own character, it's an understatement to say that the emotions at work within the young actress must have been heady and barely-tameable. It's a distinct privilege to watch their interplay over the course of her performance.</p>
<p>Finally, let me offer my apologies for the resolution of this clip — for now, it's the best that I could find. There's no mention of it on the webpage <a class="reference external" href="http://www.criterionco.com/asp/coming_soon.asp">yet</a>, but I can only assume that the Criterion Collection anamorphic DVD print is forthcoming.</p>

                    <p>I really don't think I did, but I <em>was</em> out drinking that night, so I suppose I should just go ahead and ask. Michael, Matt, Ezra, Sam, Sarah and everyone else who was out on Friday: did we get drunk at Townhouse and then go grocery shopping in Michigan? Normally I wouldn't ask, but Bank of America sent me an email on Saturday morning wondering about these charges:</p>
<p><img alt="some jerk used my card at kroger" class="center" src="/static/2007/01/21/20070117_kroger.gif" style="width: 481px; height: 69px;" /></p>
<p>I've gone ahead and ordered a new card, but man oh man will I ever feel sheepish if I find a cancelled and beer-stained Kroger receipt lying around the apartment a week from now.</p>
<p>More seriously, this has been surprisingly easy to deal with — I had the whole thing wrapped up and a temporary ATM card in hand within about an hour of getting the initial alert email. It's a real credit to Bank of America, I think, and even more noteworthy when you consider how essentially evil an organization they are.</p>
<p>The obvious question to ask is how the crook got my number at all. I haven't been patronizing internet retailers particularly much in the last week or two, but I did make a few suspect purchases:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A while ago I ordered something from <a class="reference external" href="http://www.sparkfun.com">SparkFun Electronics</a>. But those guys are great, and I've ordered from them once before. I don't think it could be them.</li>
<li>I bought a new cellphone battery from a somewhat shady Ebay retailed not too long ago. But I made the payment through PayPal (or Yahoo stores; I forget which), so I kind of doubt it was them.</li>
<li>The final and most troubling possibility is the Wii: I bought Super Mario 64 about an hour before leaving the house on Friday night, and did so by using the Wii's integrated store. But surely Nintendo processes payments securely, right? Right?</li>
</ul>
<p>My childlike faith in the internet makes it hard for me to believe that it's any of these candidates. I haven't gone through my back statements to check for earlier fraud, so it could have happened before these three candidates — I just don't know. There's also a non-electronic possibility: it could've been stolen when I opened a tab at DC9 on Thursday night, too. I did end up with a suspiciously low bar tab.</p>
<p>Anyway, it's all very mysterious, but for now the danger seems to have passed.</p>

                    <p>Lisa is about to start teaching high school English and is a <a class="reference external" href="http://bellowsbelle.typepad.com/the_bellows_belle/2007/01/teach_this.html">little surprised</a> at what's on the reading list: out with the old, in with the new, broadly speaking. It sounds more familiar to me, I'm afraid. She and I are the same age, but this trend had already hit Arlington County schools when I went through them — and Washington-Lee High School in particular.</p>
<p>I remember reading <em>Alas, Babylon</em> and <em>Cry, The Beloved Country</em> and other non- or neo-classics instead of the canon. And I have to say that I'm a little pissed off about it: I enjoyed those books, but once I got to college I mostly spent my credit-hours on computer science, neuroscience and philosophy. I wasn't able to take a ton of literature classes to fill the holes in my Western education.</p>
<p>The result has been a consistent annoyance. I'm sure that these books work just as well as the classics for teaching the sorts of things high school English students need to learn. <em>Beloved</em>, for example, was not only enjoyable but also uses some of the same narrative tricks as recent internet favorite <em>The Sound and the Fury</em>. But I would be much better equipped to get highbrow jokes, make pretentious bon mots, and complete the New York Times crossword puzzle if we had read the latter instead of the former. Ultimately, that's the real value of selecting one very good book instead of another. Either will suffice for the important stuff, but one will be more useful at cocktail parties.</p>
<p>I do think that teaching kids earnest liberal lessons about other cultures is a worthwhile goal, but I'm not convinced that novels are a very efficient way to do it. I suspect that better movie selection during those days when teacher is hungover could be just as effective. I think that the week in health class when we watched <a class="reference external" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107630/">My Life</a> would have been better spent on <a class="reference external" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075572/">Roots</a>. &quot;How to die with dignity&quot; is a lesson that can probably be delayed until sometime after graduation.</p>
<p>Of course, we did get some classics: I continue to enjoy making starvation and axe-murder jokes based on <em>Crime and Punishment</em> and <em>The Grapes of Wrath</em>. But I kind of had bad luck there, too, in that our prescribed classics tended to be either kind of shmaltzy (O Henry, lots more of the aforementioned Steinbeck) or redundant (we read a lot of Shakespeare, which is pretty much the only type of lit course that I did take again in college — my own fault, I guess) or just kind of beside the point (I'm convinced we only read <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Life-Denisovitch-Signet-Classics-Paperback/dp/0451527097/sr=8-1/qid=1168030727/ref=pd_bbs_1/105-1151806-0209230?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books">this book</a> because it was both Russian and short — a pretty rare combination — although other people insist I just missed the greatness of the novel).</p>
<p>Still, I have to give Arlington County Public Schools' reading list policy credit for one thing: it was pleasantly easy to subvert. Along with friends, I managed to get both <em>Ender's Game</em> and <em>Snow Crash</em> assigned to my classes, and it was awesome. What do <em>you</em> think YT's high-tech skateboard symbolizes?</p>

<p>And thanks to those of you that stopped by last night. I'm going to go ahead and call the whole thing a big success. We suspect that our bathroom may have been host to both drug use and, uh, romance. If that's not the mark of a good party, I don't know what is.</p>
<p>I've spent today hungover &amp; whining, but things are looking up — it may almost be time to venture out and get some food. While I steel myself for that, here are the non-terrible photos that I found on my camera this morning. I'm particularly fond of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/341374327/in/set-72157594452559819/">this shot</a> of Michael and Emily, and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/341381104/in/set-72157594452559819/">this one</a> of Spencer, who receives Party MVP status for his superlative karaoke performance (narrowly edging out Kriston, who ably assumed the mantle of DJ-dom when called to duty).</p>
<p><strong>OH YEAH:</strong> There was also some <a class="reference external" href="http://flickr.com/photos/mcdermott/340959816/in/set-72157594451931245/">knife fighting</a>. Like I said, it was a good party.</p>

I was hoping to sit on the news, taking my time to calmly and objectively evaluate how this triumph affects Sommer's place in history. I hate to be forced to make a decision prematurely, but right now I'd say she's coming in somewhere between the saints who died of puncture wounds and the ones whose deaths were related to being cooked and/or eaten.

<p>Does this look like a crushingly depressing Christmas Eve tableau? The sort of sight that Charles Bukowski might have seen before erupting in volcanic torrents of vomited eggnog? I submit to you that it is not. And that's a problem.</p>
<p>I suppose I had a good enough time hanging out with Matt and Spencer. But to be honest, we were all looking forward to a repeat of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.zunta.org/blog/archives/2006/01/02/personal_failur/">last year</a>: a bar with few people, plenty of despair and &quot;Fairytale Of New York&quot; on a nonstop loop.</p>
<p>But instead there were no Pogues albums on the jukebox, there were lots of people, and I ended up having a pretty good time. Rats.</p>

                    <p>I'm not sure what else I can do. I've been to the suburbs Sunday after Sunday — but there have been no Wiis. The last two days I've gotten up early and taken the Metro to Pentagon City before work, visiting the Best Buy within minutes of its opening — no Wiis. My [STRIKEOUT:agents] friends have generously scoured <a class="reference external" href="http://urbancoyote.blogspot.com">Texas</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cruelsommer.blogspot.com">Arizona</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.movering.com">London</a> on my behalf, like Nintendo Nazgul — no Wiis.</p>
<p>Tomorrow everyone will be off work, and it'll be too late. I may make the trek to Best Buy one more time, but I expect there'll be throngs waiting with me. My advantage will be gone, and my cause lost.</p>
<p>I suppose there's always the week after Christmas. But in the meantime I'm left seething at the thought of those who have successfully gotten their hands on the console. Have they proven their devotion? Did they deserve it more than me!? No, goddammit! I guess this is how conservatives feel about affirmative action.</p>

                    <p>A <a class="reference external" href="http://diplodocus.wordpress.com/2006/12/19/there-will-be-a-quiz/">meme</a>! Awesome. I never get these. Here we go, five things that I think most people don't know about me (but that I don't mind telling them):</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><strong>I can juggle.</strong> I learned how during summer camp and eventually got pretty decent at it — for about a week I could do passing with clubs, if given a sufficiently patient partner. I've also juggled torches in a proof-of-concept sort of way (we weren't allowed to actually light them). But I'm self-aware enough to realize that juggling is not only a useless and highly dorky skill, but also one that it's impolite and annoying to force on an unsuspecting world. So I try to keep it under wraps. For a while I would use juggling as a rough sobriety test, but eventually I got too good at doing it while under the influence. Now I only ever really break it out when I need a flashy way to accidentally damage fruit. But I do credit it with rescuing me from being a completely uncoordinated disaster at all sports; now I'm a mere embarrassment. Thanks, juggling!</li>
<li><strong>I didn't grow up with cable TV.</strong> This isn't much of a secret, but people tend to forget it in conversation. All of your gak-colored Nickelodeon memories are lost on me. <em>Hey Dude</em>, <em>You Can't Do That On Television</em>, <em>Ren &amp; Stimpy</em> — these mean almost nothing in my mind. When they come up I'll smile and nod, then try to steer the conversation toward <em>Family Double Dare</em>, <em>Transformers</em> and other over-the-air shows that are enjoying an irritating ironic renaissance.</li>
<li><strong>I'm not very good at math.</strong> People assume that I'm a math whiz because I'm interested in science, I program computers and I know what a <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/THAC0">THAC0</a> is. I suppose I'm decent at certain simple kinds of math, if only because I get occasional practice at them — I'll sometimes have to bust out some algebra to complete an algorithm I'm writing, and whenever I get in the mood to write something graphically flashy I'll enjoy doing the geometry that comes with it. But I've never been very good at calculus, and although I've encountered some slightly more advanced math during college, I've always forgotten it as quickly as possible. My eyes inevitably glaze over when I get to the formulae in the various pop science books that I otherwise enjoy reading. Personally, I blame all of this on my high school calculus teacher, who didn't manage to convey what the &quot;dx&quot; in all those equations was supposed to mean until about a week before the AP test. Looking back, I'm pretty sure she was busy having a lesbian awakening over the course of that year, so I guess I can understand her failure to impart these important concepts. Still, it was an underwhelming period of instruction, particularly when compared to my geometry class. That dude had a lazy eye — it was impossible to tell whether he was looking at you, which, as a teaching method, I can't recommend highly enough. It really kept me on my toes.</li>
<li><strong>I used to be kinda chubby.</strong> Not ridiculously so, but at my peak I was about 35 or 40 pounds heavier than I am now. I was a bulky enough kid that I was half-heartedly recruited by my high school's football coach to be on our atrociously bad and understaffed team (I had enough sense to say no, thankfully). My sophomore year of college I decided I'd had enough soda and Taco Bell to show my junkfood-eschewing parents who was boss, and got my act together.</li>
<li><strong>I'm not an atheist.</strong> I was raised in a protestant family and went to church and Sunday School every week. I hated it. I wouldn't say I believe in God — I figure I'll have some time to work it out when I'm on my deathbed — but I do know that I find people like PZ Me/yers and Richard Dawkins to be insulting, insufferable, and highly deserving of having their lunch money extracted from them by force. I don't know precisely what I believe, but I definitely don't believe in condescending arrogance. Not in other people, anyway.</li>
</ol>
<p>Alright, there it is. This meme seems to have spread strangely quickly — it's made it to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.scripting.com/2006/12/19.html#fiveThingsYouDidntKnowAboutMe">Dave Winer's blog</a>, and <a class="reference external" href="http://cyrusfarivar.com/blog/?p=1204">Cyrus</a> has already been tagged, too. Could it be that bloggers like talking about themselves? Hmm.</p>
<p>I'm tempted to try to slow the spread of the contagion by just naming one or two people... Aw, to hell with it. I'll tag <a class="reference external" href="http://www.jeffnye.org">Jeff</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://fillygrrrl.blogspot.com/">Caralyn</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://tinymovements.blogspot.com/">Genevieve</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.movering.com">Emily</a>, who should all feel free to ignore this if they're not in the mood for it.</p>

                    <p><a class="reference external" href="http://pygmalioninablanket.blogspot.com/2006/12/cram-it-yolanda.html">Complaining about bad company Christmas parties</a>? I'd like to get in on that.</p>
<p>Actually though, I haven't been to too many office Christmas parties. I've usually been lucky enough to be out of town or otherwise busy on the date in question. But right before I quit my old job I did attend one at my boss's house, and it wasn't too bad. Over the course of the evening I watched the Irish guys who populated the office gradually get drunker, redder and angrier, which was more entertainment than I had been expecting.</p>
<p>Eventually the situation was defused by the dissemination of the holiday bonus giftcards. After that, everyone left within five minutes. It wasn't a lot of fun, but it wasn't <em>that</em> bad. No worse than sitting through church, anyway.</p>
<p>But I was subjected to some entertainingly bad Christmas gifts from that job. I shouldn't really complain about the bonuses (or lack thereof) because I was generally compensated pretty well, particularly toward the end of my tenure. But there's no excuse for this:</p>
<p><img alt="a godawful denim shirt" class="center" src="http://static.flickr.com/21/89421899_233c5eb9e1.jpg" /></p>
<p>Yup, the first Christmas bonus I ever received was a button-up denim shirt with the company logo on it (and a friendly reminder that we were <a class="reference external" href="https://eweb1.sba.gov/hubzone/internet/index.cfm">HUBZone Certified</a>). And it was at least three sizes too large. Admittedly, I'm a computer programmer — it wasn't wholly unreasonable to assume that I'd grow into it, so to speak. But size aside, there was no conceivable use for the shirt that didn't involve the phrase &quot;booth at a trade show&quot;. It was more of a threat than a gift.</p>
<p>Things picked up, though. The next year I got some House of Representatives cufflinks that were actually kind of nice, but unfortunately <a class="reference external" href="http://www.wonkette.com/politics/late-night-shots/the-late-night-shots-christmas-special-222006.php">not something that I would ever wear in this town</a>. Call it a wash, I guess.</p>
<p>But my final Christmas at that job was indisputably great. The Amex gift card was a nice surprise, but the real treat was this:</p>
<p><img alt="horrible monkey" class="center" src="http://static.flickr.com/128/323240717_a75ff55876.jpg" /></p>
<p>I won it in the gift swap (my contribution to which was a pen that lit up when your cell phone rang, except actually didn't). Pictures can't convey how awful this ceramic sculpture is. I've seen this monkey elicit physical reactions of disgust in its viewers — it really does sort of make your skin crawl. This pleases me immensely, and it remains one of my most prized possessions.</p>
<p>But I think the era of the awful holiday party may be over for me — for now, anyway. EchoDitto's is on Monday, and it promises to be pleasantly full of booze and food. I begged out of last year's celebration since I hadn't yet started the job, but by all accounts it was pretty fun. So I'm looking forward to this one. The only problem is that I've got nothing lined up for the gift swap. I suppose I could always bring the monkey, but I don't think I'm ready to pass that torch just yet.</p>

<div class="line">Well, I'm back home, or at least on the Dulles toll road. We landed almost an hour late, but the flight was mostly pleasant and uneventful. I <strong>did</strong> sit behind a human being with what may be the worst sense of taste I've ever encountered — and if you've ever heard one of my own full-throated defenses of the movie <em>Predator</em>, you know that's saying something.</div>
<div class="line">But picture, if you will, an individual watching a DVD set of the NBC series <em>Las Vegas</em> on her laptop. I mean, it's one thing if you're sitting at home on a Saturday night, desperate to have Nicki Cox distract you from the crushing weight of existence. But to see someone pay for the privilege of taking that experience with them anywhere... Well, it was troubling, at the least. Then, when I saw that the laptop was sitting next to a Lonely Planet guide to Florida, I knew that that pleasant-seeming lady was utterly doomed.</div>
<div class="line">(I know that I've got friends, family and maybe readers in Florida. But c'mon — you know what I'm talking about.)</div>
<div class="line"><strong>ALSO:</strong> can anyone explain to me why TSA insists on cell phones being turned off while you're in the line for customs or waiting for your bags afterward? I can believe there may be a good reason, but like most air travel regulations on cellphones, I have a feeling it's mostly just capricious, officious rulemaking. What could they be worried about, anyway? Someone cheating on their answers to the customs officials? &quot;He's asking me whether I brought back any fruit... I need an answer, quick!&quot;</div>

<div class="line">Werewolves are the only movie monster that I've ever found really terrifying, as I mentioned in <a class="reference external" href="http://www.unfogged.com/archives/week_2006_11_12.html#005780">this</a> unfogged thread. The loss of self and merciless, unstoppable ferocity that underpin the werewolf mythology have always added up to a particularly terrifying sum in my mind — and exposure to a memorable X-Files episode at an impressionable age didn't help matters. Besides, they have none of the saving graces of the other classic monsters: they don't possess any of the vampire's sexy villainy; they only shamble when particularly full, making them harder to escape from than mummies or zombies; and unlike the relatively rare creature from the black lagoon, blob or giant Japanese reptile, werewolves are completely ubiquitous (COMPLETELY. Look out your window right now — you should see at least two.).</div>
<div class="line">I mention all of this because the United Kingdom is <a class="reference external" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082010/">clearly</a> <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werewolves_of_London">ground zero</a> for lycanthropes. This point was underscored by Emily forcing me to begin watching <a class="reference external" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0280609/">Dog Soldiers</a> the day before my departure. It's a movie which — based on the admittedly limited part I've seen so far — seems to be about werewolves viciously disemboweling English infantrymen in the woods of their homeland. That's my understanding, anyway; Emily assures me that it gets much scarier after the point at which we stopped, which, given the inconceivability of further werewolf-terror escalation, makes me think that maybe it'll turn out to be an existential meditation on the banality of existence or something.</div>
<div class="line">Anyway, to lay your fears to rest: day two of this London trip has now drawn to a close, and I have yet to be eviscerated, bitten, or even attacked by a mysteriously large dog that quickly disappeared into the brush. Going into this trip I was <em>sure</em> that at some point Michael would turn to me and say he'd forgotten the adapter for the projector, and would I mind running back to the hotel to fetch it? It shouldn't take me long, it's just across that foggy moonlit moor.</div>
<div class="line">But so far we've managed to remember all of our technical gear. And if I'm under any supernatural curses, the folks from Gre/enpe/ace have at least been nice enough to utter them quietly.</div>

<div class="line"><img alt="a typical British scene" class="right" src="http://static.flickr.com/115/314178158_45dd9da21b_m.jpg" />Despite a valiant attempt to forget my passport, I currently appear to be in London. I can tell because the Starbucks I'm sitting in is trying to sell me &quot;crisps&quot;. If not for that, I'd probably have no idea. Jetlag is in full effect, and the last thing I ate was a microwaved airline croissant that I probably shouldn't have.</div>
<div class="line">I'm over here for the training portion of our contract with Gre/enpe/ace UK. And while I recognize that it's pretty boorish to complain about free transatlantic travel, I'm going to do so anyway. Perhaps this trip will be better, but the last one consisted of a bunch of 14+ hour days and one of the worst periods in my personal life that I can remember. By the end of it the near-inevitability of getting creamed by a left-bearing automobile seemed like something to be embraced.</div>
<div class="line">But I'll try to rouse myself. The beer's awfully good, and the folks we're meeting with are smart and fun. Once I've gotten some more sleep and internet I should cheer up pretty quickly.</div>

I should've known something was up when the smoke at the Black Cat and <a class="reference external" href="http://cruelsommer.blogspot.com">Sommer</a>'s party started to bother me. I'm usually of at least average hardiness when it comes to friends' cigarette fumes, but this time I was dying.</div>
<div class="line">For once, I recognized my symptoms for what they were and immediately took countermeasures. My mom favors echinacea, but the male side of my family demands rigorous pseudo-scientific analyses that have been published in a respected journal, or at least on the back of an authoritative-looking cardboard box. So I started consuming zinc lozenges at a prodigious rate.</div>
<div class="line">If you start taking it quickly enough, zinc gluconate is supposed to decrease the length of colds by, I don't know, ramping up your white blood cell production, or <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galvanize">galvanizing</a> them or something. They say they've got studies proving it works, but of course it's hard to judge from first-hand experience.</div>
<div class="line">The initial results weren't promising. I was laid pretty low; my body shut down all non-essential processes — alertness, cleverness, interest in the Britney Spears divorce — leaving only those biological systems necessary for maintaining a steady stream of whining. But I think I'm getting better, or at least trading old symptoms for new ones — and by my standards it's happening relatively quickly, too. I don't think this is going to become my annual epic month-long illness (tentative arrival date: February).</div>
<div class="line">Anyway, I'll heartily recommend the zinc drops, if only because they let you feel like you're doing something to improve things, instead of just wallowing in phlegm and misery. But there is a downside: you're supposed to suck on them, not swallow them. They don't taste particularly great, but they're bearable, particularly if you buy the brand-name version. But that's just priming you for the real unpleasantness, which comes when you eat anything else.</div>
<div class="line">It's a little hard to describe the taste that results. The best I've been able to come up with is &quot;hollandaise sauce made with rotten eggs and 9-volt batteries&quot;. It's like the experience a vulture must have when eating a cyborg's carcass.</div>
<div class="line">Why the sudden, food-triggered onset? I have no idea. Maybe the change in flavor wakes up neurons that have grown inured to the original zinc drop. Maybe the acid in the food makes the zinc rust out of solution, producing a different and worse-tasting compound (chemistry nerds, help me out here). Whatever it is, it seems to be unavoidable, regardless of how much water and time you place between the lozenge and the food. It's the taste of wellness, and it's terrible.</div>

<div class="line">Wow. The past seven days have been pretty hectic — so much so that I'm a little shocked to see that it's been a week since I posted something here. Weird. Even more troubling, I haven't even been able to play with my <a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/44137303&#64;N00/286872273">new toy</a> (I'm referring to the microcontroller).</div>
<div class="line">Well, hopefully it'll calm down a bit. Election day is a good, decisive marking point. My subconscious thinks so, anyway: I've been having election dreams.</div>
<div class="line">It's pretty unusual for me. I don't dream very often — not in a way that's coherent enough to remember, at least. But these were vivid and occurred in quicker succession than I'm used to.</div>
<div class="line">The first one involved the deaths of both <a class="reference external" href="http://dccharles.blogspot.com">Charles</a>' mom and <a class="reference external" href="http://cruelsommer.blogspot.com">Sommer</a>. Although tragic, details remain fuzzy about the fate of the former. But I can say with confidence that Sommer died in a horrific rocket attack (delivered via helicopter) on a George Allen rally. What was she doing there? I'll leave it to Sommer to explain herself.</div>
<div class="line">The second dream was a bit weirder. I was in an airport departure lounge, getting ready to be shipped off to Iraq with a number of friends, Starship-Troopers-style. Only we weren't going to fight enormous insectoid aliens, or even Iraqis. Instead we were being sent as media grunts, drafted against our will to report fluff pieces with a pro-America spin. More specifically, we were all divvied up to produce television segments on the different member nations in the so-called <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinational_force_in_Iraq#List_of_nations_in_the_Coalition">Coalition of the Willing</a>. I got <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eritrea">Eritrea</a>, which is not actually a part of the aforementioned coalition. I was understandably worried about finding an angle for my reports.</div>
<div class="line">Both dreams were weirdly affecting. I woke up from the first one despairing, genuinely unsure of whether the narrative's victims were alive or not. I woke up from the second one furious (although this was admittedly more because of some frustrating in-dream boarding pass problems I'd had with security than because I was being forced to sugarcoat a monstrously immoral war — that part was dandy).</div>
<div class="line">Now, I'm no expert at dream interpretation. It's possible that my subconscious is actually more preocuppied with helicopters and TV news than with the election. But having <em>any</em> sort of political backdrop to my unwaking escapades is pretty weird, particularly given their rarity.</div>
<div class="line">So, for what little it's worth: I suspect we'll only get four seats in the senate. Because the universe is unjust, and it seems likely to me that at least one race will be swung by a last-minute helicopter attack.</div>

<div class="line">Ayer's Hardware is the greatest store on earth. From the wealth of electrical doodads to the penny candy to the commendably deadly toy guns, it's a winner all the way. I've had two friends work there, re-told <a class="reference external" href="http://www.jeffnye.org">Jeff</a>'s story about Mr. Ayers dying on the breakroom couch dozens of times, and been in the store for post-church candy acquisition on more occasions than I can possibly count. Also, it's where my in-store Santa of choice resided when I was a kid. It's a great store.</div>
<div class="line">It's also probably the best place on earth to go for last-minute Halloween costume preparation. With its help (and a brief stop by Target for thermal underwear), I was able to go from zero to Krang in the space of one afternoon. I think it turned out pretty well:</div>
<div class="line"><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://flickr.com/photos/93467005&#64;N00/282314554/"><img alt="me as krang; photo by yglesias" src="http://static.flickr.com/94/282314554_eae729385c.jpg" /></a></div>
<div class="line">Fewer people knew that Krang was an evil brain from Dimension X (a subdivision of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle universe) than I had expected, but those that did seemed pretty enthusiastic about it. More importantly, at the moment I appear to be occupying the top three spots on Flickr for the tag &quot;<a class="reference external" href="http://flickr.com/photos/tags/krang">krang</a>&quot;, which is extremely great.</div>
<div class="line">But I don't really deserve any of the credit: Emily came up with the idea. Her Cylon costume was highly successful in its own right, featuring hexagonal dog tags, spaceboots and precisely-selected spacetanktops. And, if I can boast a little, it had a pretty great light-up spine (that I took a pretty non-great video of after the batteries had mostly died). Note to future generations of Cylon impersonators: 27 volts is about right for a string of seven Christmas lights. We used 36v, and apparently it got unpleasantly hot.</div>

But my track record of displaying my love for the occasion is mixed, and this year I'm being particularly lame. I haven't acquired any pumpkins, I haven't decided on a costume, and I certainly haven't summoned any unspeakable creatures of ancient evil from beyond the bounds of sane men's dreams. I'm dropping the ball.</div>
<div class="line">I've made my peace with this, though. I've more or less resigned myself to dealing with middle age by being the creepy guy who puts way too much effort into decorating his house each year, so it's okay if I run up a Halloween-related karmic debt right now. Besides, by the time next year's celebration rolls around I anticipate having learned how to make animatronic monsters (leaving only genuine necromancy remaining on my lifetime h'ween syllabus).</div>
<div class="line">But I don't want to let the date slip by entirely, so for now I'll just offer some Halloween-y media that I enjoy:</div>
</div>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.vice-recordings.com/halloween/">Do They Know It's Halloween?</a> I still love this song a stupid amount (be forewarned: there's sound on the page at that link). I sang its praises <a class="reference external" href="http://www.zunta.org/blog/archives/2005/10/27/rocktober_31st/">last year</a>, but my enthusiasm for the concept and execution hasn't dimmed. It stayed in my regular ipod rotation for an embarrassingly large amount of November '05, and it's wormed its way back in over the past few weeks.</li>
<li>Hellboy! I came across the pretty-good movie adaptation on TV last night, which naturally reminded me of the <a class="reference external" href="http://isohunt.com/torrents/?ihq=hellboy+right+hand+doom">totally awesome comic</a> (viewer applications: <a class="reference external" href="http://pixelcomic.deskmod.com/">currently-unavailable PC viewer</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.softpedia.com/get/Multimedia/Graphic/Graphic-Viewers/GonVisor.shtml">untested PC viewer</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://jomic.sourceforge.net/">okay Mac viewer</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.bitcartel.com/comicbooklover/">untested Mac viewer</a>). I soliloquized on Hellboy in a pretty tiring manner <a class="reference external" href="http://www.zunta.org/blog/archives/2004/04/12/the_aforementio/">a year and a half ago</a> — if you're curious to know the storyline, head there. If you just want to read a deeply creepy and well-realized horror pastiche, start that Bittorrent download posthaste.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.x-entertainment.com/articles/0690/">Garfield's Halloween Adventure</a>. Admittedly, I haven't actually seen this since I was a little kid, and anything associated with this franchise is generally pretty terrible. But it remains one of my most vivid Halloween memories. The internet disagrees with me, but I swear that when I saw this as a kid it contained a bunch of short animated pieces in addition to the main storyline. One of these centered on an orange cat — drawn in a completely different and generally more realistic style — escaping from an animal testing lab and being hunted down by scientists and dogs. In the final scene he escapes capture by involuntarily transforming into a dog — the result of the horrible testing he had undergone.
Okay, I might not be doing a good job of making it sound creepy as it seemed. But it scared the <em>hell</em> out of me when I first saw it. Now, sadly, the internet seems to have collectively forgotten this unusually grim chapter in the Garfield ouevre. Or maybe the sheer terror of it all just made everyone repress the memory. Anyway, this special was way better than Charlie Brown's annual Halloween apostasy. Great Pumpkin?! Screw that.</li>

                    <p>Yeah, okay, Kriston's pretty well <a class="reference external" href="http://grammarpolice.net/archives/001097.php">got my number</a>. I can't say that I'm too upset, though. I'm so used to getting grief over the Boy Scouts' admittedly inexcusable policies on homosexuality that having gentle fun poked at their new &quot;Respect Copyrights Activity Patch&quot; feels like a relief. Also, Kriston was kind enough not to excerpt this part of the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-scouts21oct21,0,6146565.story?coll=la-home-headlines">original article</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
The inspiration for the new badge came from Hong Kong, where the local Boy Scouts organization had its members pledge not to use or buy pirated materials. In addition, the Scouts agreed to search Internet file-sharing sites and turn in sites and users they see violating the law. The campaign was launched at a stadium before a slew of pop stars where the so-called &quot;youth ambassadors&quot; pledged to stem the rise piracy.</blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">So you're organizing rallies of youth devoted to turning undesirables over to the powers that be, eh? Sounds, uh, potentially problematic. Particularly since artifacts like <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitler_Youth_Knife">these knives</a> exist. (I actually own one — but hey, it was inherited! And originally purchased at a New Zealand flea market! And honestly, it's not evil in any easily-identifiable way, other than being the most deadly-looking object bearing the Boy Scout insignia that you can possibly imagine, which was the reason I kept it around.)</div>
<div class="line">I think it would behoove everybody to take a step back and remember that the Boy Scouts' weirdly militaristic structure works because it's designed to complement the impulses of little boys, who are, in most important respects, tiny fascists. It sounds bad, but it works out pretty well so long as the aggression is safely channeled down the command structure (and age brackets). Using those ugly impulses to further grown-ups' own martial fantasies turns really creepy really quickly, though.</div>
<div class="line">But I think it'll be alright: this is just an &quot;activity badge&quot;, after all — it carries far less metaphysical import than a real merit badge. In fact, I don't actually remember whether activity badges existed during my tenure in the Boy Scouts. They may be a recent invention of Big Badge, catering to the same mouth-breathing demographic that powers our nation's vanity licenseplate industry. I won't be a bit surprised if the coming months bring us both the &quot;threw brick through Strabucks window at ANSWER rally&quot; activity badge AND the &quot;strewed plastic mini-fetuses outside abortion clinic&quot; activity badge (it's called the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.thelongtail.com/">long tail</a>, people, and it's potentially mostly not imaginary).</div>
<div class="line">As long as the merit badge institution remains safely devoted to wholesome activities like <a class="reference external" href="http://www.brunchma.com/~acsumama/blog">rabbit-raising</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://ficke.blogspot.com/">philatelism SLASH numismatology</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.usscouts.org/mb/mb024.html">harnessing the fearsome power of the atom</a>, all is well with the world. And even if merit badges do become corrupted, there's still one last bastion of badge integrity that would have to be assailed before I lost my enthusiasm for the entire institution.</div>
<div class="line">You see, much like radioactive disasters, the very best badges were the ones that conferred new powers: Tote N' Chip let you play with knives, and the seldom-seen Fire N' Chip let you burn things (many troops, including my own, recognized boykind's innate right to play with fire and dispensed with the latter). I think there may have been a Torment The Fat Kid N' Chip badge as well, but I always missed the meetings where they were distributed.</div>
<div class="line">Merit badges, on the other hand, were simply a means of advancing in rank. Aside from the marksmanship badges, none carried the awesome destructive potential required to elicit any kind of enthusiasm from those earning them. Usually having one just meant that you had spent an uncomfortable half-hour talking to your friend's mom about Citizenship.</div>
<div class="line">So I think we'll be alright. Although if they start somehow incorporating DRM into swiss army knives (no whittling copyrighted works!), somebody's gonna have to die.</div>

                    <p>Some of you might've seen <a class="reference external" href="http://www.dcist.com/archives/2006/10/17/frightening_fil.php">my post on DCist</a> yesterday about Count Gore De Vol, DC's hometown horror host. I have to confess that I wasn't aware of his existence until recently. Now that I do I'm an instant fan.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://isohunt.com/torrents/?ihq=uhf">Local broadcasting</a> sounds like a lot of fun — in one interview I read, Dick Dyszel, the man behind Count Gore, recounts the character's origins: the station needed a horror movie host, and he already had a lot of white pancake makeup on hand since he also helmed the channel's Bozo the Clown franchise. In addition to the makeup, he says he already had a cape lying around because &quot;it was the seventies&quot; (which I find mystifying and vaguely scandalous). Transylvanian accents are cheaper than either of those things, therefore: vampire.</p>
<p>But not only was I ignorant of the Count's existence, I didn't even realize that horror hosts were a national phenomenon. Of course I knew about <a class="reference external" href="http://www.elvira.com">Elvira</a>, Mistress of the Dark. But it turns out that her only real innovation was having enormous breasts. There are <a class="reference external" href="http://www.horrorhosts.com/">horror hosts</a> all over the country, presiding over plywood coffins and quietly helming late-night showings of abysmally bad scary movies. Some are <a class="reference external" href="http://www.creaturescape.com/HHH/sonofghoul/sonofghoul.htm">charming</a>, some are <a class="reference external" href="http://www.geocities.com/horrorhostunderground/html/hosts/119.htm">kind of sad</a> (yet apparently popular), and others look like they might be <a class="reference external" href="http://www.creaturescape.com/HHH/themortician/themortician.htm">legitimately spooky</a> (check out the guy's <a class="reference external" href="http://themortician.web.aplus.net/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderfiles/sitebreak.mpg">sample video</a>).</p>
<p>Even though he's no longer on the air, it's nice to know that Count Gore is ours — particularly since he seems to be among the most venerable and lighthearted of the horror hosts. And <a class="reference external" href="http://countgore.com/Dungeon.htm">his webpage</a> contains regular columns from a bunch of hosts from other parts of the country, which implies to me that there's a real sense of community among these guys. I like to imagine them all getting together for barbeques.</p>
<p>Anyway, I find it all pretty heartwarming. I'm still not ready to subscribe to Fangoria, though.</p>

                    <p>I feel your pain, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.unfogged.com/archives/week_2006_10_08.html#005580">Billy</a>. On Saturday I drove down 395 to visit my mom in Louisa (home of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.charlottesvillenewsplex.tv/news/headlines/4250196.html">alleged deer heads</a>!). On the way there I saw two deeply confusing things.</p>
<p>First, a Calvin window decal on a truck. He wasn't urinating, though — he and Susie Derkins were kneeling in prayer before a towering cross. It looked a little like <a class="reference external" href="http://www.webbsgraphics.com/decals/imagemagic.php?img=3dfKzcvYoeTbnZapx9Ho2uKboJufk9na2g%3D%3D&amp;w=400&amp;h=300&amp;page=popup">this</a>, except for that sticker's lack of Susie (there are a lot of variations on this decal available on the web).</p>
<p>I guess the message is that there is a power and a love in this world even greater than that of Ford or Chevy. I know that it's hard to open your heart to such a possibility, but the angry piety written on the face of the woman driving the SUV in question told me that I ought to try. Or else.</p>
<p>ALSO: while trying to find that particular decal, I stumbled across <a class="reference external" href="http://www.stickergiant.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?ftbppp_sort=popularity&amp;Screen=SRCH&amp;Store_Code=sg&amp;search=calvin">this page</a>. I defy you to find a better window into the conservative zeitgeist.</p>
<p>Second, a roadside fruit stand/garden center on Rt. 3 had a 30'-tall silver figurine crucified on an enormous cross. It has &quot;NASA&quot; clumsily written on its thigh. It doesn't seem to exist on Flickr yet, and I missed it on my way home, but <a class="reference external" href="http://flickr.com/photos/trevira/138205065/">this</a> might give you some of the flavor. But think bigger, silverier, and more crucified. Somebody either really likes astronauts or really hates them. That, or they have a serious space-crow problem.</p>
