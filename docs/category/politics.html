                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>Not to me, anyway.&nbsp; But I think that perhaps I could just use some further explanation from people smarter than myself about how the financial system works.&nbsp; So consider this a plea for help -- one that I would've issued over Twitter, if Twitter's character limit was 2300% larger.</p>
<p>Anyway, the problem: <a class="reference external" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/11/AR2010011103892.html?hpid=topnews">this article</a> makes the case that the Federal Reserve has been having a very profitable year:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Fed will return about $45 billion to the U.S. Treasury for 2009, according to calculations by The Washington Post based on public documents. That reflects the highest earnings in the 96-year history of the central bank. The Fed, unlike most government agencies, funds itself from its own operations and returns its profits to the Treasury.</p>
<p>The numbers are good news for the federal budget and a sign that the Fed has been successful, at least so far, in protecting taxpayers as it intervenes in the economy -- though there remains a risk of significant losses in the future if the Fed sells some of its investments or loses money on its stakes in bailed-out firms.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>Much of the higher earnings came about because of the Fed's aggressive program of buying bonds, aiming to push interest rates down across the economy and thus stimulate growth. By the end of 2009, the Fed owned $1.8 trillion in U.S. government debt and mortgage-related securities, up from $497 billion a year earlier. The interest income on those investments was a major source of Fed profits -- though that income comes with risks, as the central bank could lose money if it later sells those securities to reduce the money supply.</p>
<p>The Fed also made money on its emergency loans to banks and other firms and on special programs to prop up lending, such as one that supports credit cards, auto loans, and other consumer and business lending. Those programs impose interest and fees on participants, with the aim of ensuring that the Fed does not lose money.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, okay, some of this makes sense: the emergency loan programs involve third parties and can, in fact, produce profit via interest on the loans.</p>
<p>But two questions.&nbsp; First: as the article states, these earnings will go back to the Treasury, which will be &quot;good news for the federal budget&quot; -- except that much of the earnings are attributed to gains from purchased federal debt -- bonds paid out by the Treasury.&nbsp; So, uh, how is this &quot;profit&quot; not completely circular?&nbsp; I suppose that perhaps it represents money that we thought we had spent but hadn't.&nbsp; Still, the Post's presentation of the issue seems very strange.</p>
<p>Second: what is the article talking about, anyway? Not to toot my own project's horn <em>too</em> much, but we've got <a class="reference external" href="http://www.subsidyscope.com/bailout/federal-reserve/">this nifty visualization of fed holdings</a> based on their weekly H.4.1 reports, and it's just not the case that the fed has increased the amount of Treasury securities it holds.&nbsp; There was a dip, but we're basically back at 2007 levels.&nbsp; The fed's portfolio has gotten much larger thanks to the bailout, but the real story looks to be its still-expanding investment in mortgage-backed securities.</p>
<p>I'm just the tech guy, so I hesitate to go much further out on this limb.&nbsp; But I think Neil Irwin could've done a lot more to distinguish between Treasuries and MBSes, and what they mean for the Fed's holdings.&nbsp; Help me Ryan Avent, you're my only hope!</p>
<p><strong>MORE:</strong> The <a class="reference external" href="http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2010/01/12/the-feds-earnings/#comments">first comment</a> on Felix Salmon's coverage of this article is helpful: basically, this is good news because it's not bad news.&nbsp; Perhaps it's a bit silly to think of profit from Treasury securities as a windfall for the government, but at least the Fed managed to keep prices from collapsing, which could've easily happened.&nbsp; I'm still confused by how the article presents its thesis, though.</p>

                    <p>Okay, yes, Michele Bachmann <a class="reference external" href="http://washingtontimes.com/news/2009/jun/17/exclusive-minn-lawmaker-fears-census-abuse/">refusing to participate in the census</a> is a bit kooky. But I'm sympathetic. I started participating in the Census survey of household employment a few weeks ago (SPOILER ALERT: I still have a job). The very next day I began receiving unusually high numbers of calls from phone surveys. Pepco, private companies, and who knows how many other sample-seekers who I hung up on before identifying. It's leveled off a bit since, but there was a pronounced effect.</p>
<p>I know, I know: they're not allowed to sell my information. It's probably just coincidence. I mean, malfeasance by the government or its agents? The very idea is ludicrous!</p>
<p>And yet I remain convinced by the experience. And so I understand where Michele is coming from. If they're willing to sell my phone number, is it <em>really</em> so outlandish to think that the ACORN agents administering the census will be secretly sizing up respondent families' fitness in order to facilitate the involuntary harvesting of organs (and their subsequent redistribution to welfare recipients) under the coming socialized medicine dystopia? Of course not. Stay strong, Michele.</p>

                    <p><a class="reference external" href="http://meganmcardle.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/11/manhattan_no_more.php">This post of Megan's</a>, which details why calls for &quot;another Manhattan Project&quot; are dumb, is quite good. I'll go ahead and suggest that calls for &quot;another Apollo Program&quot; are generally even dumber — they're the same thing, except the speaker doesn't have enough guts to be willing to bring the A-bomb to mind.</p>
<p>But this got me thinking about the circumstances under which these sorts of projects can work. Here's my stab at it. These sorts of national greatness problems need:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>... to be primarily an engineering problem.</li>
<li>... to not contain the words &quot;... and be economically viable&quot;.</li>
<li>... to have been solved at a smaller scale, or to seem solvable on the basis of some compelling math.</li>
<li>... to not be about finding a solution to a biological problem, unless that problem can be solved by wiping out a non-microscopic organism.</li>
<li>... to be undertaken out of concern that another country might get a leg up on us if we don't succeed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Obviously this is based on a small set of data points. Basically: we've built the atom bomb, gone to the moon, dug a big canal, built a bunch of roads, and run a number of impressive (and impressively expensive) science experiments. We almost certainly <em>could</em> wipe out malaria (almost did!), or develop cellulosic ethanol/Jimmy Carter's &quot;synthetic oil&quot;, but we either don't really want to or think it might be a waste of money. And we definitely haven't cured cancer or AIDS, despite trying pretty hard.</p>
<p>There've been more than forty State of the Union speeches since Kennedy said we were moonward-bound, so I'm sure I'm missing at least that many calls for ambitious national initiatives. But this is the basic lay of the land, I think: you've got to pick something that seems genuinely urgent, and which is hard but not too hard. It's simple when you put it that way.</p>
<p>As you might imagine, I'm rooting for China to announce that they're building a space elevator.</p>

                    <p>My professional journalist friends are professionally obligated to, well, be professional. Although this precept serves them and their readers well nearly all of the time, I think it will prevent them from analyzing the <a class="reference external" href="http://kdka.com/local/attack.McCain.Bloomfield.2.847628.html">Ashley Todd affair</a> with the thoroughness it deserves. So, unencumbered as I am by such considerations, let me try to clarify the lesson that should be drawn from all this: College Republicans are the fucking scum of the earth.</p>
<p>I say this not to insult Republicans in general. I disagree with members of the GOP about a lot of things, but recognize that nearly all of them are perfectly good, reasonable people. But in my experience, folks who become involved in the party's machinery at a young age seem to be intensely despicable at a much higher rate than their more mature fellow travelers. I was hesitant to be skeptical of Todd's account, at first — skepticism is not generally an appropriate way to respond to the claims of a victim of violent crime. But if the picture was sort of suspicious, Todd's campus affiliations left me feeling even more dubious about her story.</p>
<p>College is a time for quixotic idealism. That's not to say that young people can't earnestly hold conservative beliefs, of course. But if a person is passionately pro-life or nutty for Nozick, he or she is, at that age, much more likely to become involved in an advocacy organization that tries to further those ends directly — it's easy to find such organizations on a college campus, after all. Normal people get involved in politics by first caring about an issue, then realizing that the best way to achieve their ends is to organize their efforts under the umbrella of a larger party. That doesn't happen all at once, though.</p>
<p>Who opts to instead immediately begin working for a demographically unpopular political party, where your chief activities will involve writing little-noticed op-eds and arranging speaking honoraria for recently disgraced administration officials? Often, the answer seems to be those with a Machiavellian enthusiasm for reaching the levers of power. These are not good people.</p>
<p>Why don't I think the same criticism thing applies to the young Democrats? Well, to an extent I'm sure it does. But I think it's probably easier to be a starry-eyed College Democrat. You can participate in various organizational efforts motivated by an idealistic conception of participatory democracy — registering new voters, that sort of thing. There will be a lot more of you, too, making participation more appealing to the sorts of people who want to get laid rather than the sorts of people who want to screw others — you'll be surrounded by more normal people, in other words. You'll also probably have less funding per capita and, by virtue of your numbers, more internal tension and examination, making it harder to twist inward into a tight little coven of aspiring conspirators.</p>
<p>But of course I'm speculating here. Besides, there's no reason to get defensive; hijinks like those of Todd and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.dailyprincetonian.com/archives/2007/12/14/news/19743.shtml">Francisco Nava</a> speak for themselves. Maybe the College Democrats are every bit as despicable as their Republican counterparts. But if they are, then they seem to at least be a bit more competent about it. Give them credit for that. There are few things more pathetic than a liar who's not yet adept at her craft. Someone who tries to inflame racial tensions to further her political ends is one of those things, though.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Tim writes to remind me that not all College Republicans are horrible people. Well, alright. I overstated things a bit. But my point remains: fewer young people are attracted to the organization than to its Democratic equivalent, and to some extent they come for different reasons. Some of those reasons are not healthy.</p>
<p>A few others things. First, credit where due: much of the conservative blogosphere has from the start approached this story in a restrained and thoughtful manner. Second, those saying that Todd's refusal of medical attention was a clue to the hoax are wrong — I've refused police offers of medical attention after getting hit by a car (twice, in fact). If something bad has happened to you and you're pretty sure you're okay, sometimes you just want to go home (if you haven't got health insurance and are unsure who'd be footing the bill, this goes double). Third, Todd seems to now be alleging a history of mental health problems. Depending on how this claim turns out, my feelings about the hoax may become very muddy indeed. The territory where &quot;couldn't help it&quot; begins is murky, and, from a practical standpoint, not necessarily coextensive with &quot;should be excused&quot;.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>Michael Pollan was on Fresh Air a moment ago. It's part of his world/public radio tour in support of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/12/magazine/12policy-t.html?partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink">Farmer In Chief</a>, last week's NYT Magazine article asking the next president to adopt better agricultural policies. I heard him giving pretty much the same spiel on a Philadelphia-area NPR station over the weekend, too.</p>
<p>I don't want to quibble with the man's larger crusade, but he keeps making one particular point that really bugs me. Pollan is fond of pointing out that since 1960 the average American household's spending on food has dropped as a share of income, from 18 percent to 10.</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure this is dumb. Or half, dumb, anyway. I'm sure food <em>has</em> gotten cheaper in absolute terms, and that those savings have been paid for in animal suffering and environmental destruction.</p>
<p>But it's also the case that household income tends to increase faster than the rate of inflation, while human nutritional requirements do not. <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_household_income#Median_household_income_and_the_economy">Wikipedia says that real median income has increased about 30% since 1967</a>. Unless I'm missing something, that means that if a family used to spend $1800 on food, today they spend $1300 — not $1000, as Pollan implies. If median household income data was available for 1960, rather than 1967, you can bet that the differential would be smaller still. And if you consider the fact that household size has <a class="reference external" href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14942047/">declined from 3 to 2.6 people</a> since 1967, the gap shrinks even more.</p>
<p>Of course, the picture is much more complicated than just a dollar amount. I'm sure we eat out a lot more, eat more processed food, eat more meat, pay more for specialty food and less for staples, and generally eat in ways that support Pollan's thesis. But this particular argument about income is a bit dishonest, and I wish he'd quit using it. Nutritional needs do not scale with income.</p>
<p>This is a pet peeve of mine with economic arguments about consumption in general: they tend not to pay any attention to the limits of human biology. This is why I'm similarly suspicious of estimates of exploding per capita bandwidth consumption. Yes, our bandwidth needs will continue to increase. But the human nervous system has its own bandwidth limits, too. Maybe there'll be one more video resolution revolution — HDTV2, let's say (pending the invention of a more confusing acronym). But to go beyond that will require video walls — they look cool in <em>Total Recall</em>, but why would you pay for something larger than your field of view? — or three-dimensional holo-whatnots. I'm sure the latter will be popularized eventually, but I'll probably be pretty old and confused by then.</p>
<p>The human fovea has a finite number of neurons, and we're already pretty good at keeping them busy. Personally, I think that household bandwidth use is likely to level off sometime in the next decade or two — there's only so much data that a human body can use. Our bandwidth expenses as a percentage of income will then start to fall, both because the growth in demand has slowed and because income continues to rise, but also because the resource itself will continue to get cheaper as technology improves.</p>
<p>That won't constitute proof that we aren't spending <em>enough</em> on bandwidth, though. It'll just mean that we've found some other stuff to spend our new money on, rather than simply ramping up our budget linearly. (My guess: hyper-ipods.)</p>

                    <p>I'm not a regular reader of the <a class="reference external" href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/">Corner</a>, but I've found myself stopping by after each debate to enjoy a bit of schadenfreude. And, with apologies to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.brianbeutler.com">Brian</a> — this is <a class="reference external" href="http://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Abrianbeutler.com%20corner%20bashing">his gig</a> — it really just makes <a class="reference external" href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=MjQxM2YzM2U5YTk1YjE0ODQyNWI5NmIzMTA2ZjFkZjA=">no goddamn sense</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Saturday Night Live recently did a terrific sketch on the bailout bill in Congress. Shortly afterward, the sketch â€” which had been available on NBC's website â€” disappeared. The sketch mocked a wealthy couple who profited off subprime mortgages named Herb and Marion Sandler, and it turns out there really is a wealthy couple named Herb and Marion Sandler who made billions off of subprime loans, and speculation was that offending the real Sandlers was the reason for pulling the sketch.</div>
<div class="line">So now the sketch is back up, without any mention of the Sandlers. But as the L.A. Times notes, what's really curious is that the re-edited sketch removed any satirical references to Barney Frank's involvement in creating the economic crisis:</div>
</div>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">In the original skit Sandler addresses Frank, saying, &quot;And thank you Congressman Frank as well as many Republicans for helping block Congressional oversight of our corrupt activities.&quot;</div>
<div class="line">To which Frank replies enthusiastically, &quot;Not at all!&quot;</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>That's all gone. I'd love to hear an explanation for that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Okay, here's an explanation: when you edit a character out of a scene, it's awkward to leave in lines that have other actors interacting with that now-nonexistent character. I realize this may seem like kind of a technical point, but I assure you that even those of us who are not professional screenwriters can, with diligence, grasp the dramaturgical logic underlying NBC's decision.</p>
<p>I've got no opinion of the decision to edit out the Sandlers, incidentally. Aside from the Barney Frank impression it was a pretty lousy sketch anyway — making it shorter is a generally good idea.</p>

                    <p>Once again, I pretty much lost track of the debate by its end — I was typing furiously and drinking too fast. But I guess I agree that Palin seemed to be merely a bit dim, rather than so cartoonishly stupid that you'd hesitate to trust her with solid food.</p>
<p>She did regress in at least one respect, though: her pronunciation. She managed to say the word &quot;nuclear&quot; perfectly correctly during her convention speech. But last night she adopted the &quot;nucular&quot; formulation favored by grade school boys and our current president. Here, check it out.</p>

<p>There are a few ways to react to this. <a class="reference external" href="http://www.unfogged.com/archives/week_2008_09_28.html#009273">Wolfson linked</a> to <a class="reference external" href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001134.html">this piece at Language Log</a> today, which perceptively notes that:</p>
<blockquote>
Ordinary people, faced with what are for them deviant, &quot;wrong&quot;, bits of language, see nothing but a mistake, period. They are resistant to the linguist's idea that there could be a rationale for the &quot;mistake&quot;, even a system to it, or that, in fact, the very same thing could result from different sources or represent different systems. (This attitude presents a tough challenge when we teach beginning linguistics courses -- not only when we talk about dialects, but also when we talk about language acquisition. One of the hardest lessons for many students is that instead of saying what's wrong, what people &quot;can't&quot; or &quot;won't&quot; do, they should be describing what people *do*, and making hypotheses about *why* they do that.)</blockquote>
<p>On the other hand, this is stupid. It's nuclear. Everybody knows that. Perhaps someday the situation will become sufficiently muddy that a postmodern assessment of the word's pronunciation will become appropriate. But we're not there yet. Right now if you press people — even those who say nucular — most will grudgingly admit that there is a correct pronunciation of the word, and that it doesn't rhyme with &quot;tubular&quot;.</p>
<p>Also, it's worth pointing out that linguistics is dumb and the classes I had to take about it in college were awful. So there.</p>
<p>No, I prefer to subscribe to a theory along <a class="reference external" href="http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~nunberg/nucular.html">these lines</a>: namely, that the choice to use the &quot;nucular&quot; pronunciation is increasingly a deliberate one, at least among politicians. I suspect that it's going to eventually become a sign of party allegiance on the right, a little piece of deliberate ignorance designed to subtly defame members of the &quot;Democrat Party&quot;.</p>
<p>The only other explanation I can think of for the discrepancy in Palin's pronunciation is that her convention speech was spelled out on the teleprompter (which she <a class="reference external" href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=NTY3MTI3MzhmNzhmNGJlYmIwOTYzMTNmZjA4ZDk3MTE=">didn't</a> <a class="reference external" href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=ZjM5NjhhMDYwZDgwYWRlNWFhZTUzMTEyZTk5YjBjY2E=">use</a>, mind you!) FO-NET-I-KAL-LEE. I suppose that's plausible enough — you can take your pick between that or the deliberate mispronunciation explanation. As it so often does when examining modern conservative behavior, it's a toss up between stupidity and malevolence.</p>

<p>It's good! But I've gotta say: if you grew up going to a church with a halfway-competent minister — someone with some charisma and some time spent in seminary — this clip is going to sound pretty familiar. That's not to diminish it, but the cadence and patterns are amazingly similar to what I listened to every Sunday growing up. This guy's got talent, no doubt, and his message is an indisputably important one. But it's a well-trodden form. I guess I just want to point out that if you find this experience particularly moving, you can probably enjoy it on a weekly basis a few blocks from your house. It'll be a bit more Jesus-y, but the delivery and rhetorical structure will be just as satisfying.</p>
<p>And I say all this as a kid who grew up Presbyterian. The Frozen Chosen! I can only imagine the firestorm that a Baptist with some book-learnin' could bust out.</p>

Major news outlets have written such fact-checking articles for years. &quot;But in the last two election cycles, the very notion that the facts matter seems to be under assault,&quot; said Michael X. Delli Carpini, an authority on political ads at the University of Pennsylvania's Annenberg School for Communication. &quot;Candidates and their consultants seem to have learned that as long as you don't back down from your charges or claims, they will stick in the minds of voters regardless of their accuracy or at a minimum, what the truth is will remain murky, a matter of opinion rather than fact.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>I have read a lot of comments like this over the past few weeks. And while they're sort of funny, they're also deeply depressing. I suppose that says as much about my sense of humor as it does about the electorate. But one of those things results in awkward moments at parties, while the other will ultimately lead to the death of thousands, if not millions, if not the destruction of the entire planet.</p>

<ul class="simple">
<li>To everyone asserting that the Democrats just don't get it, and that only you, the author, have a privileged insight into what makes real Americans so gosh-darn <em>real</em> — and they're going to love Sarah Palin! — please, shut the fuck up. You're just guessing, you out-of-touch elitist, exactly the same way that I am. Show me some polls. Even if you dismiss the fact that the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003844485">early</a> <a class="reference external" href="http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080903/NEWS15/80904002">returns</a> don't agree with your analysis, you should temper your statements with the realization that the odds of the vice presidential pick having a significant impact on the race's outcome are very, very small.</li>
<li>To those using Twitter for non-humorous political analysis: you should probably stop. This applies doubly for Democrats who employ it to compliment Republican machinations in an attempt to paint themselves as bold, contrarian truth-tellers in the tradition of — what, Alan Colmes? The instantaneous, abbreviated nature of the medium makes this a tough act to pull off; you'll usually just come off sounding credulous and reactionary. The good news is that if you're reading this you're almost certainly not who I have in mind. But really: if you want to play contrarian, do it in a macroblog format. That will at least afford you enough characters to express your dumb observations in a clever-sounding way.</li>
</ul>
<p>Whew! I sure am cantankerous this morning.</p>
<p><strong>ALSO:</strong> Somewhat less emphatically, let me add that I (predictably) don't really buy the argument that going after Palin will prompt a meaningful backlash. In terms of media narratives, sure — but nobody should care about that. The <a class="reference external" href="http://matthewyglesias.theatlantic.com/archives/2007/11/smear_me_once.php">depressing truth</a> seems to be that the first mover advantage overwhelms the final result of most societal deliberations.</p>

<p>I'm surprised to hear myself say it, but after reading <a class="reference external" href="http://dcist.com/2008/07/23/novak_hits_pedestrian_its_not_joe_w.php">Martin's writeup</a> I feel a little bad for Bob Novak, who hit a pedestrian with his car this morning. It sounds like it was only a matter of time: the comments are just getting started, but so far about 10% are from people reporting incidents where Novak almost hit them, too.</p>
<p>But like I said, I feel bad for the guy. Bob and I go way back. When I was a little kid I used to watch the McLaughlin Group with my dad. I don't remember much from that experience besides McLaughlin's plaid Christmas jacket and the paternally-instilled lesson that Novak was a Very Bad Man. The situation became clearer during senior year of high school, when my government teacher would fulfill his educational duty by showing us taped episodes of <em>Crossfire</em>. It was an exciting time: Bill Press pioneered the disoriented, exasperated style of liberalism that would later help America ignore Al Gore; and the program itself was just beginning to metastasize into the odious force that Jon Stewart would eventually banish to another dimension. But the most remarkable spectacle was happening across the table from Press, where Robert Novak exuded pure reptilian malevolence with the sort of ease that made you want to stand up and applaud. When he tried to smile the entire class would physically recoil.</p>
<p>But now, looking back, I realize that Novakian evil isn't anything to fear. I didn't know it at the time, but the McLaughlin Groupies who should have been inspiring bone-chilling terror were Fred Barnes and Mort Kondracke. They were the true harbingers, the types of guys whose ilk might lobby for offshore drilling on the strength of an invitation to an oil magnate's daughter's super sweet sixteen; or who might accidentally launch missiles while trying to play Snood, then refuse to feel bad about it.</p>
<p>So what if Novak outs the occasional CIA agent or runs down the occasional pedestrian? His is a totally comprehensible evil. And, for what it's worth, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.radaronline.com/features/2008/07/hated_pundits_chris_matthews_keith_olbermann_bill_oreilly_an_4.php">this Radar feature</a> indicates that he's a perfectly nice old man, who delights staffers at every office holiday party with jigs played upon his famous golden fiddle.</p>
<p>My point is that Washington knows how to deal with his type: when we've had a few too many missing pedestrians and/or wars, the town's bravest men descend into the secret Masonic catacombs below and, confronting the beast with hemlock and holy water, force him to dissolve into shrieks and a foul, sulfurous mist. At this point the Washington Times prints a note indicating that Mr. Novak will be on vacation until the next solstice, and everyone declares themselves more or less satisfied.</p>
<p>That's the way things work around here, and it's a system we're comfortable with. Seeing misfortune befall ol' Bob seems like an imbalance, and that makes me sad. If I get my choice of foe I'll take reptilian evil over reptile-sized brains any day.</p>

                    <p>Ezra <a class="reference external" href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/ezraklein_archive?month=06&amp;year=2008&amp;base_name=saucy_ignorant_contrarianism">links approvingly</a> to a <a class="reference external" href="http://thinkprogress.org/wonkroom/2008/06/07/wired-ignorant-libertarianism/">Wonk Room post</a> complaining about <a class="reference external" href="http://www.wired.com/science/planetearth/magazine/16-06/ff_heresies_intro">Wired's new environmentalist-baiting issue</a>, which, among other things, decries green enthusiasm for organic farming as detrimental to the more important cause of reducing greenhouse emissions.</p>
<p>The author, Paulina Borsook, doesn't challenge the article's contention that organic farming is less productive than conventional farming. But she finds fault with the Wired article because its carbon calculation fails to include a number of factors: carbon emitted transporting fertilizer, pesticides and hormones; the carbon capital costs of the companies that supply them; and carbon impact of increased healthcare costs stemming from the consumption of non-organic food.</p>
<p>Some of these critiques are legitimate. Some of them are pretty silly. None of them are quantitative in any way.</p>
<p>It's easy to see why. Seriously, how many fewer medical expenses will an average individual incur if they eat organic food versus non-organic food? No, no cheating: I said &quot;seriously&quot;. No hunches allowed. You have to actually cite data and do the math. Good luck. I'd be impressed if you even manage to come up with a plausible justification for your answer's order of magnitude.</p>
<p>Doing this stuff is impossibly difficult, as is amply demonstrated every time someone tries to figure out the comparatively narrowly-defined problem of biofuels' net energy balance. This is the first problem: literally every human endeavor consumes energy — and of course, it's very hard to reduce any action in civilization to just one step. It's tough to figure out how much energy something took, very tough to accurately guess, and nearly impossible to know how much carbon it took to generate that energy.</p>
<p>This came up when I was out in San Francisco for work (a trip that was unambiguously environmentally awful, I'll be the first to admit). Over beers Michael told a story about a passenger on his flight jealously guarding his trash, refusing to surrender it to the flight attendants unless they promised it would be recycled.</p>
<p>But it's not that easy, right? Last I heard, metal is unambiguously beneficial to recycle; glass takes more energy to recycle than it's worth; and plastic — well, who knows? It probably depends on the type of plastic and where the recycling plant is.</p>
<p>Or take the great <a class="reference external" href="http://blogs.nature.com/news/thegreatbeyond/2008/05/get_your_greendex.html">coffee cup debate</a>: if a given ceramic mug is likely to get less than a thousand uses, you're better off drinking from a styrofoam cup. Probably, anyway. I'm sure it depends on your dishwasher, or its settings. Or if you don't have a dishwasher. Or the detergent you buy. And probably how far you are from the water pumping station, right? Maybe how much rain your area gets, or has gotten this year, or what floor you live on.</p>
<p>Which is the other problem: as individuals it seems like we all pretty much live within the margin of error on these questions. It adds up over the population, of course, but for one person it's nearly impossible to know what the right thing to do is. There are unambiguous things, of course: don't leave the water running when you brush your teeth, and minimize electricity use, and don't leave your car idling. Although sometimes even <em>those</em> wind up ambiguous: I've heard that restarting a car takes about as much gas as running it for a minute.</p>
<p>But then, I probably heard that from someplace like Wired. So who knows? This is the real problem, the meta-problem: while the only people with an incentive to really figure this out are academics, the only people with an incentive to <em>talk</em> about it are those who sell ad space to people targeting an audience that likes green content or an audience that likes counterintuitive content (both detestable in their own ways). And the press is more than comfortable enough with their anecdotes and innumeracy to continue publishing hunches they had while shopping at Whole Foods, as if a half-day's worth of googling and algebra was sufficient to untangle the world's unimaginably complicated economic and energy-use web (a pursuit that I admit I've <a class="reference external" href="http://www.manifestdensity.net/2007/10/15/or_we_could_just_drink_gasolin/">indulged</a> in myself — but at least nobody paid me for it).</p>
<p>All of which is to say that until we actually tax or cap or otherwise price carbon, Borsook's counterargument is just as silly as the Wired piece. We'll all keep doing our best, but it's inevitably going to be lame and probably ineffective until we've got some reliable, unignorable signals from which to make decisions. Until then I don't know what to do besides make my best guesses, muddle through, and rededicate myself to an overwhelming sense of defeatist liberal guilt.</p>

                    <p>So where can I sign up for more timely updates from the media conspiracy? I'm imagining an email list. Or maybe a dashboard widget with Growl notifications telling me when and how to unfairly marginalize the Ron Paul campaign.</p>
<p>When I went to bed last night, MSNBC had begun expressing doubts about Senator Clinton's prospects. But that was it! By this morning the floodgates had opened and suddenly everyone is willing to acknowledge what has been true for weeks: that there's really no way for her to catch up that doesn't involve people taking to the streets. It really is striking, bizarre, and a bit frightening to see how suddenly, uniformly and arbitrarily this change occurred. The most generous interpretation is that after one or two people risked embarrassment by acknowledging the actual situation, everyone else felt free to adopt the new storyline.</p>
<p>Without the fourth estate to help it play make-believe, I guess it's unlikely that the Clinton campaign is long for this world. That's fine by me. But I'm still a little bitter: I'd gotten pretty good at writing rote, despairing <a class="reference external" href="http://dcist.com/2008/05/07/morning_roundup_252.php">morning roundup</a> introductions about the primary campaign's interminability. When I woke up this morning and rescanned the headlines I had to throw away a rather clever paragraph. Sucks!</p>
<p>So please: a little more warning next time the media conspiracy suddenly and arbitrarily shifts direction — those of us at the distant bottom of the org chart would really appreciate it. Maybe you guys could set up a Google Calendar or something.</p>

                    <p>So I guess that Glenn Greenwald and Megan are having a fight over what stories the media covers. This seems a little odd, but I guess she yelled at him, so now his commenters are yelling at her. And while I don't want to align myself with the people who comment on her site, who tend to be (for one reason if not another) some of the worst people on the planet, it's worth remembering just how lousy the metrics data Megan <a class="reference external" href="http://meganmcardle.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/04/a_great_business_opportunity.php">refers to</a> can be.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://idolator.com/tunes/corporate-rock-still-sells/who-arbitrates-arbitron-328449.php">Consider this admittedly irritatingly-formatted conversation about the Arbitron ratings</a>. Basically: over the last decade or so Arbitron, the one big radio ratings agency, recorded the declining popularity of rock radio, and stations like DC's own WHFS were shuttered (boo!). Then Arbitron developed a new technology that passively monitors what people listen to instead of relying on them to accurately report their listening habits. It turned out that rock radio was considerably more popular than anyone thought — rock listeners were just unusually bad at filling out Arbitron's surveys. With that factor removed, rock stations are now once again popping up in cities that have rolled out the new monitoring technology.</p>
<p>Now, while I certainly don't want to imply that listening to Smash Mouth correlates with intelligence, in general I think it's probably true that it's harder to collect tracking metrics on the sorts of educated, sophisticated consumers that Greenwald's commenters presumably consider themselves to be. Their time will tend to be more valuable, meaning your ratings company will be able to afford to buy less of it. And they may have less time to consume media, meaning there's less collectible data available per capita — even if you don't have to pay for it. They also may be quicker to notice that you're tracking or otherwise inconveniencing them and take steps to stop you. Show of hands — how many people are reading this with Adblock Plus installed?</p>
<p>From listening to Emily talk about her work it's clear that avoiding sampling error is hard enough when the attempt is made in a rigorous, well-funded academic setting. And of course the situation here is considerably worse. Ratings companies like Nielsen, Arbitron and the like have a financial incentive to sample poorly (or as poorly as they can get away with). And, from my cursory understanding of their industry (I read DCRTV! I tell clients which web analytic reports to buy!), it doesn't seem as though the firms sell themselves with their highly scientific methods so much as they sell themselves by being the only game in town.</p>
<p>So it doesn't seem totally outrageous to me to suggest that metrics-driven editorial decisions may favor idiotic stories even more than the economists' magical intersecting lines say they should. I think the internet has helped reverse this trend, but America is still probably being fed stupider content than it ought to be. And, lest you think I'm just creating elaborate justifications for my own tastes' supremacy, keep in mind that I say all this as a guy who ordered a pay-per-view wrestling event less than a month ago.</p>

                    <p>Look, I like Barack Obama, too. I hope he wins the nomination and becomes our next president. But <a class="reference external" href="http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2008/3/5/14345/50395/126/469746">this stuff</a> about the Clinton campaign altering videotape of him to make him seem blacker is just crazy. Have we all really never seen a political ad before? Here, allow me to summarize the art form for you:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><em>Grainy, black and white footage of Candidate A, stretched extra-wide or extra-tall. The camera slowly zooms in on Candidate A's lips, which move in slow motion but without sound.</em></div>
<div class="line">NARRATOR: Candidate A says he's for [good things]. But according to [somewhat reputable news source] on [date] he said [nuanced opinion]. Maybe that's why [neutral-sounding fringe group] called Candidate A &quot;[outrageous smear]&quot;.</div>
<div class="line"><em>(brief pause)</em></div>
<div class="line">NARRATOR: Candidate A. [misleading interrogatory]?</div>
<div class="line"><em>Cut to wide shot of Candidate B. He is standing in a sunlit alpine valley, surrounded by adorable woodland creatures and an assemblage of attractive, multicultural children. They look up to him expectantly, hoping to absorb the wisdom of their elders so that they, too, might grow up and take their rightful places in the glorious unfolding story that is AMERICA.</em></div>
<div class="line">Candidate B: I'm Candidate B, and I approved this message because [something other than &quot;I owe private industry many favors&quot;].</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>This is how things go. You jack up the contrast, distort the image, slow it down and screw around with the colors because it makes your opponent look generically creepy — not because it accentuates particular racial attributes. For some reason the kossacks are pretending that nobody has ever run video of their opponent through a filter. They're either <a class="reference external" href="http://althouse.blogspot.com/2008/03/why-are-letters-nig-on-childs-pajamas.html">insane</a>, dishonest, or haven't been paying any attention at all. This graphical sniping is common enough that <a class="reference external" href="http://www.snpp.com/episodes/2F02.html">it's been parodied on The Simpsons</a>, for pete's sake.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> More from <a class="reference external" href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2008_03/013281.php">Kevin Drum</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.factcheck.org/elections-2008/did_clinton_darken_obamas_skin.html">FactCheck.org</a>. I hadn't realized that the evidence being cited was coming from different video sources, and that one of them is <em>YouTube</em>, for chrissakes. It's simply impossible to meaningfully identify the sort of subtle trickery that's being alleged when the quality of the evidence is so poor.</p>
<p>With that in mind, a few good litmus tests to apply before opining on these matters: can you succinctly define <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_correction">gamma correction</a>? Have you ever had to figure out what <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_space">color space</a> an image is using? Does <a class="reference external" href="http://spyder.datacolor.com/index_us.php">this</a> look at all familiar? If so, then by all means speak your mind. If not, allow me to gently suggest that you have some wikipedia-reading to do.</p>
<p>After that, get me digital stills from the debate and the ad that were recorded on the same hardware. Only then will it be possible to identify the alleged manipulation as genuinely existing — at which point my previous objections about the likely lack of racial malice surrounding the manipulation will resume applying. Seriously: this is laughably weak stuff.</p>

                    <p>I meant to talk about the new evidence that biofuels are a bad idea when <a class="reference external" href="http://www.brianbeutler.com/2008/02/corn_woes/">Brian first wrote about it</a>, but I forgot. Today <a class="reference external" href="http://matthewyglesias.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/02/flipflop_needed.php">Matt mentioned it</a>, and I was reminded that virtually everyone is ignoring a key aspect of the biofuel land use debate. If I may quote the beginning of the cover story in the current issue of the excellent <a class="reference external" href="http://www.brewingnews.com/mid-atlantic/">Mid-Atlantic Brewing News</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Blame drought in Australia and rain in Europe. Blame increased interest in ethanol as an energy source.</div>
<div class="line">Even blame the growing popularity of beer in China.</div>
<div class="line">Those—and more—are reasons to expect higher beer prices in 2008, and why some brewers will be unable to make some beers no matter how strong the consumer demand. Craft brewers face what more than one calls &quot;a perfect storm&quot; of higher costs and reduced availability for both the hops and malt used to make their beers.</div>
<div class="line">&quot;Prices are going to go up... there's just no doubt about it,&quot; predicts Jim Busch of Downingtown, Pa.'s Victory Brewing Co. &quot;And some brands will disappear. Other brands will just totally change in their character.&quot;</div>
<div class="line">&quot;Brewer owners are going to have to raise their prices,&quot; agrees Russian River Brewing Co. founder and brewer Vinnie Cilurzo in Santa Rosa, Calif., &quot;just to stay in business.&quot;</div>
<div class="line">&quot;I think this year will be, to use the Chinese curse phrase, 'interesting,'&quot; comments Hugh Sisson, president of Baltimore's Clipper City Brewing Co.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>The threat is real, people. You know <a class="reference external" href="http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/3620/2898/">Tupper's Hop Pocket</a>, right? Well, not this year you won't — ingredient prices have made it not viable to produce.</p>
<p>So, to summarize: changing global climate; baseless biofuel enthusiasm; and the terrifying prospect of a nation's worth of people who look different from use dragging themselves out of poverty — all of these forces are conspiring to make your favorite brand of beer marginally more expensive and/or taste a little less like pine needles.</p>
<p>And what are our prospective presidential nominees doing about this looming crisis? Nothing. There was only one man prepared to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.dennis4president.com/go/issues/a-sustainable-future/">stop global climate change</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.desmoinesregister.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071106/NEWS09/711060402">approach biofuels with appropriate skepticism</a>, and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/14759/candidates_on_us_policy_toward_china.html#261">exact merciless economic punishment upon the Chinese</a> for drinking beer (instead of attending to human rights). That's right — it was <a class="reference external" href="http://www.satyamag.com/nov03/beerintro.html">Dennis Kucinich: the Beer Candidate</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for our nation's future, this truth has become apparent too late. Hell, I would've done my best to support a Department of Peace with a straight face if only he'd explicitly pledged to keep beer prices low. I used to think it was just the former that couldn't occur without the latter; now I see that it works both ways.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>Alright. I am, admittedly, not an economist or health care expert. But I've spent an above-average amount of time drinking with people of both persuasions. And I read <a class="reference external" href="http://pipeline.corante.com/archives/2008/01/28/laissezfaire.php">the same Derek Lowe post</a> as Megan. But I was struck with a pretty different thought as I read it, which I will now bore you with.</p>
<p>The question at hand is whether it would be a good idea to give the U.S. government the power to bargain on behalf of prospective drug buyers. Right now Europe may be getting a free ride thanks to the relatively high prices we pay in non-monopsonistic system, the thinking goes. Empower U.S. consumers (by, uh, de-empowering them), get them lower domestic prices, and perhaps European prices will be driven up to compensate.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://meganmcardle.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/01/supply_meet_demand_demand_meet.php">Megan</a> and Dr. Lowe both say that's silly, and I buy their arguments — it's more likely that the total market size would shrink rather than automatically rebalancing itself in a zero-sum manner. But Megan also says this:</p>
<blockquote>
What we are losing through Europe's refusal to pay higher prices for drugs is not help covering the cost of the drugs that our buying funds; it is the never discovered drugs that a larger and more lucrative market would have supported.</blockquote>
<p>So, alright, I'm willing to believe that there's a socially optimal size for the pharmaceutical market. If the drug companies get more money they can spend more on R&amp;D and we'll get better drugs. Conversely, if they get less money (because we're paying less per pill) we'll be able to give the currently available drugs to more people who need them..</p>
<p>But here's the thing: if you're a regular reader of Lowe's blog, you know that the drug industry has been doing <em>terribly</em> at coming up with useful new drugs recently. At ITP this is usually expressed in terms of concern over what big companies are going to do when their blockbuster patents expire and they have nothing to replace them with. But it also means that recently the social benefit we get from each dollar of pharma R&amp;D has been relatively low. In the past few years a lot of new drugs have proven to be dangerous, or less useful than the ones they were supposed to replace, or have failed in the final stages of the regulatory process.</p>
<p>The line about drug companies profiting off of publicly-funded research is a canard — Lowe has convincingly explained this again and again. But all the indications are that the admittedly intensive process of turning &quot;basic research&quot; into usable drugs has been working less well than usual recently — from failed inhaled insulin to cholesterol-lowerers that don't affect artery blockage to weight loss pills that make patients want to kill themselves, it's been a pretty dismal period. So dismal, in fact, that at the moment it seems that, if anything, we're spending too much money on drug development — if there's a real tradeoff here, it sounds to me like we should be foregoing some of that expensive and currently unproductive research in favor of buying generic statins by the truckload.</p>
<p>If the progress of the related science occurs in a perfectly linear order then I suppose there's an argument for pushing through this dry spell. But it seems likely that it doesn't; that instead the aforementioned &quot;basic research&quot; informs the drug development process, and that if we just sit back and wait for a bit we might end up getting more bang per buck across time.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Also, this seems crazy:</p>
<blockquote>
So the most probable outcome of introducing monopsony power here [in the U.S.] is that the market for drugs shrinks to the point where it will support few-to-no new drugs.</blockquote>
<p>What?!</p>

                    <p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.movering.com">Emily</a>, continuing an impossibly long streak of being great, sent Charles and me some Xbox games as a thank-you for the use of his car when getting her moved back to Philly for the new semester. One is &quot;The Darkness&quot;, which I haven't yet played but apparently revolves around a demonically-possessed mob hitman who uses his supernatural powers to exact brutal revenge upon his enemies, including eating their hearts to increase his occult abilities (or, as summed up by <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Darkness_%28video_game%29#_note-0">Game Informer's review</a>: &quot;Players are immersed in an adventure that brings out the best of humanity&quot;).</p>
<p>The other game is Bioshock, which has received a lot of &quot;Game of the Year&quot; nods and which Charles popped into the Xbox 360 last night. It's pretty amazing. It's been out since September, I believe, but for those who don't keep up with the state of the art in nerdery: set in 1960, the game begins with the player swimming toward the surface of the ocean. You emerge, gasping, amidst the flaming wreckage of a plane. After swimming into the blackness of the waves you find a mysterious tower. Inside is a bathyscope that carries you beneath the sea to a fantastic art deco city filled with super-science, Objectivist folderol and a society that's in the process of catastrophic collapse. So far the shooter mechanics seem to be fairly ordinary (though fun!), but it's fascinating to watch the city and its story reveal themselves. The mysterious founder, Andrew Ryan (anagram alert!) is equal parts Ayn Rand and Charles Foster Kane — it's fantastic to listen to the recordings of his crazed idealism that are scattered through the game, even as you realize that the game's ultimate means of grappling with his philosophy will likely involve firing rockets at it.</p>
<p>I spent a little time this morning googling for the inappropriately cerebral magazine articles that I expected such a pop-Libertarian exercise to spawn, but so far I've come up mostly empty-handed. There's <a class="reference external" href="http://www.wired.com/gaming/gamingreviews/magazine/15-09/pl_games">this</a> Wired review, but it mostly makes it sound like another game where the creators have included a continuum (frequently available by pressing &quot;start&quot;) between obvious good and obvious evil and then called it &quot;moral complexity&quot;. <a class="reference external" href="http://www.avclub.com/content/games/bioshock">This Onion AV Club piece</a> makes it seem like that may actually be the case in terms of play mechanics. But the comments on <a class="reference external" href="http://www.reason.com/blog/show/122437.html">this Hit &amp; Run blog post</a> (which points at the Onion review) make it clear that the underlying story isn't so simplistically interpreted.</p>
<p>The creator of the game has given a <a class="reference external" href="http://objectivistcenter.org/cs/forums/318/ShowPost.aspx">number</a> of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3153215">interviews</a> touching on what he thinks and intended, but I'm surprised that none of the tech-savvy Libertarian journalists I know have taken the chance to write up a review. I should say that although it seems to be a pretty fantastic videogame, I've got no illusions about Bioshock's ultimate philosophical relevance — I get the feeling that most of the Libertarians I speak to consider Rand something of a weight around their necks in terms of how they're popularly perceived, and it seems unlikely that a video game designer who explicitly bills himself as unserious will have any genuinely new ideas to contribute. But it still seems like a decent hook for an article, and a potentially excellent way to get your employer to pay for an Xbox.</p>

                    <p>Earlier tonight I was tuned to the Food Network, watching Emeril trudge mirthlessly toward whatever release it is that he has in mind (syndication? retirement? death?). Inevitably, the program cut to commercial. I was presented with a spot encouraging me to sign up for a Health Savings Account. There are savings to be had, apparently! They even had a former Bush administration official on hand to attest to this fact.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://hsainsights.com/">This</a> is the website they were promoting. But I had a strangely hard time finding it just now, having forgotten the exact URL in the whiskey-filled hours between. Googling &quot;HSA insight&quot; didn't turn up anything. They haven't bought any Google Adwords. <a class="reference external" href="http://hsainsight.com/">hsainsight.com</a> is a parked domain. And the commercial itself was kind of cheap-looking and lame. Overall, it seems to be an awfully amateurish production.</p>
<p>So I'm confused. I thought that HSAs were being peddled by dishonest but well-funded rightwing ideologues anxious to have our health insurance system's collective principal shuttled over to Wall Street for a quick one-time windfall (our nation's hedge fund managers' yachts are dangerously tasteful, after all). I expect them to have tons of cash on hand to help them achieve this goal.</p>
<p>But the half-assed nature of this campaign has turned everything on its head. Suddenly it looks like health savings accounts aren't the risky, underclass-bilking investment vehicle that my favorite commentators had led me to believe. Apparently the HSA pimps couldn't even afford <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Mays">Billy Mays</a>! So what gives?</p>

America America aw shucks apparently-not-diabolical. Fine. But what's this?</p>
<blockquote>
[Huckabee] tells audiences that the only soap his family could afford was the rough Lava soap, and that he was in college before he realized showering didnâ€™t have to hurt. &quot;There are people paying $150 for an exfoliation,&quot; he jokes. &quot;I could just hand them a bar of Lava soap.&quot;</blockquote>
<p>He's right about one thing: Lava soap is pretty rough. My dad often had some of their products around the house for cleaning grease off of his hands, and it was definitely not something you'd use without noticing. But that's because it's supposed to be that way — <em>it's got little bits of pumice mixed in</em>.</p>
<p>Anyway what's this bullshit about it being cheap? Lava is a highly specialized utility soap, and one would expect it to command a premium. Clearly, this calls for some internet research. I compared prices for Lava versus Irish Spring — a nice, middle-of-the-road soap used by right-thinking Americans such as myself. A NOTE ON METHODOLOGICAL RIGOR: Lava is mostly sold as single bars. On the web, Irish Spring tends to be sold in 3-packs, so I've divided its prices by the number of bars. Surely a hardscrabble, cost-conscious family like the Huckabees would've bought in bulk.</p>

<p>The best price I could find for Lava was on Amazon — if you buy the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/oz-Lava-Bar-Soap-LAVA/dp/B0002ZW79U/ref=pd_bbs_2/105-2434525-4440409?ie=UTF8&amp;s=hpc&amp;qid=1192836726&amp;sr=8-2">48-pack</a> you can get it for $0.89/bar. But that's still more expensive than retail amounts of Irish Spring, and the package is suspiciously green. If you're really looking for budget soap you can do considerably better than that. Or you could simply pass horse urine through straw and mix with lard. You <em>do</em> slaughter your own pigs, don't you?</p>
<p>So what can we conclude from all of this? I think there are two possibilities. Either Mike Huckabee is a compulsive liar and therefore completely unfit for office; or the Huckabee family has some sort of hereditary economic disability. The latter could perhaps account for his otherwise inexplicable enthusiasm for raising taxes sometimes, slightly. Either way, it's important that he be exposed for the confused old man and/or transparent fraud that he is. Has anything been done with the word &quot;Huckster&quot; yet?</p>
<p>This is the most obviously despicable campaign trail behavior since John Kerry's 2004 cheesesteak pandering. I expect the next Youtube debate to feature AT LEAST one soap-related question.</p>

Will Wilkinson breaks things down <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cato-at-liberty.org/2007/10/12/why-the-mechanisms-of-inequality-matter/">here</a>, and his reading seems about right to me: Matt and Ezra are gunning for maximizing well-being rather than cosmic justice. Will's probably also right about it not being a very good idea to make this argument to the public.</p>
<p>But this struck me as wrong, or at least unfair:</p>
<blockquote>
But surely Matt understands that the inability of utilitarianism to acknowledge principled constraints on the way people may use one another is the main reason why most moral philosophers believe utilitarianism to be false. Perhaps Matt thinks these philosophers confused. But if so, then they share their confusion with most Americans, who also donâ€™t believe utility maximization is a good justification for the appropriation of their property.</blockquote>
<p>Sure, hardline utilitarianism is unappealing. But I doubt that Ezra or Matt actually believe in it. <em>Rule</em> utilitarianism works just fine, and lets us simultaneously accommodate the public's intuition that A) they should be able to go under anesthesia without having their organs harvested and B) there's a fuzzily-defined and slight but real inverse relationship between wealth and property rights — i.e. it's okay to take a few extra hot sauce packets from Taco Bell for later use. And isn't accordance with intuition what the validity of a philosophical system is all about?</p>
<p>Of course, this standpoint is still pretty paternalistic. To which I can only respond: meh.</p>

                    <p>I sure didn't. Actually, my AP Government class mostly spent its time listening to the teacher rhapsodize about Teddy Roosevelt and watching tapes of Bill Press and Bob Novak facing off on an early incarnation of <em>Crossfire</em>.</p>
<p>I don't think my experience was unique. In fact, judging by the coverage of the current <a class="reference external" href="http://atrios.blogspot.com/2007_07_15_archive.html#3567467763734758492">filibuster/non-filibuster/filibuster-forcing-pre-filibuster</a>, it seems pretty clear that even those who should be among the best-informed observers of the political process have very little idea how parliamentary procedure works. Despite the fact that it's completely essential to understanding how things get done in the legislature, reporters tend to just fake their way through coverage of it. I'm beginning to wonder whether anyone outside of a tiny set of professional staffers actually understands how our government works.</p>
<p>It's all very, very strange. It might be time to update those Schoolhouse Rock cartoons into longer, more boring versions of the originals. And hey, as an added bonus, doing so will also provide additional material for a new wave of ironic t-shirt iron-ons two decades from now! It's win-win.</p>

                    <p>Emily and I are in Cazenovia for the weekend, barely. Decades of inbreeding and exposure to elevated levels of cosmic radiation have finally taken their toll on the men and women of the US airline industry: it appears that we're in the waning days of air travel. Our flight was delayed — everyone's flight was delayed. Time lost its meaning, the captain sang the Flipper theme song to us over the intercom, and everyone was inexplicably wearing shorts. The situation is very bad. And as unpleasant as it was to get to bed at 4AM, our ordeal will no doubt pale in comparison to that of the poor soulds who'll be flying after us. God help you all.</p>
<p>Still, there were some bright spots during our time at BWI. First, there was this:</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/663553496/"><img alt="I'd rather be seen reading High Times" class="center" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1068/663553496_3793413541.jpg" style="width: 375px; height: 500px;" /></a></p>
<p>I really can't think of a lifestyle more debauched than driving your boat around, pickin' up boat groupies. It's as if on the last day of 1979 all the swingers were rounded up and banished forever from dry land.</p>
<p>But — speaking of deviancy — the more interesting sighting was a real life Ron Pa/ul supporter:</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/662702991/"><img alt="the Ron Paul REVOLUTION" class="center" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1070/662702991_6ee292e6b6.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: 375px;" /></a></p>
<p>He was accompanied by a profoundly androgenous brother sporting a Mao bag/women's-cut pinstripe jacket combo, and a paunchy father who presumably could have done more. But of course the most striking thing was the t-shirt, the back of which featured the URL of ronpa/ulhq.com, your and my unofficial center for Ron Pa/ul advocacy. Could this young man be part of the legions of Ron Pa/ul enthusiasts (&quot;Paul Bearers&quot;?) whose internet evangelism has put Paul into solid contention for the MySpace vote, and prompted National Journal to enthusiastically declare, &quot;<a class="reference external" href="http://wonkette.com/politics/dept%27-of-second-life-same-as-the-first/national-journal-would-like-you-ron-paul-fanatics-to-knock-it-off-266610.php">Please stop emailing us</a>&quot;?</p>
<p>It seems likely. There was definitely a wild quality about him — an ungroomed Van Dyke on his chin, a flash in his eyes, and a threateningly big class ring on his knuckles — that evoked the mix of iconoclasm and feverish irrationality that necessarily define a political candidate hellbent on dismantling the government.</p>
<p>More disturbingly, I watched him use an actual, honest-to-god pay phone — twice! Now sure, not everyone can afford a cell phone. But this guy and his family looked solidly middle class, and I'm pretty sure his dad had a phone clipped to his belt. Could he just not be trusted to borrow it? Had dad received one too many expensive cellular bills filled with cold-calls to Iowa on Dr. Pa/ul's behalf? Or is it simply that a court-ordered psychological evaluation had barred him from cell phone use? Whatever it was, I'm glad that we're unlikely to cross paths again (except perhaps in Second Life).</p>

First, because it ends on this brazen note:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Ms. Charles has come to think that if this case forces Edâ€™s Lobster Bar to change until it no longer resembles Pearl Oyster Bar, it could be the most influential thing she has ever done.</div>
<div class="line">&quot;I thought if I could have success with this lawsuit, that could be an important contribution,&quot; she said. &quot;If some guy in California is having problems, he could go to his lawyer and look at this case and say, 'Maybe we can do something about it.' &quot;</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>That's right — you'll be doing a <strong>huge</strong> favor to humanity by bringing IP litigation to the world of foodservice in order to protect your business's margins. Thanks a ton, really. But a word of advice: they say it hurts your chances if you campaign for the Nobel outright.</p>
<p>Second, there's the article itself, which completely ignores the well-settled legal questions involved. The closest the article comes to saying &quot;recipes absolutely, unequivocally cannot be copyrighted&quot; (as it ought to) is quoting another restaurant owner who laments, &quot;You canâ€™t protect recipes, you canâ€™t protect what a place looks like, itâ€™s impossible.&quot; That makes it sound like the system is stacked against him protecting his rights — instead of the system explicitly saying he can't assert IP rights over other people's cooking, which is the <em>actual</em> situation. And for what it's worth, the article implies that trademark law <em>can</em> protect what a place looks like — I'm pretty sure that's right, the McDonald's clone in <a class="reference external" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094898/">Coming To America</a> notwithstanding.</p>
<p>All of this ignores the public domain innovations that Ms. Charles benefits from, royalty-free: the cocktails her bartenders serve, the system of reservation-making she presumably employs, and, most amazingly, the Caesar Salad recipe that she says her mother got from another restaurant, but <em>which she's now suing her sous chef for using</em>. Diffuse borrowing seems to be okay; borrowing too much from one place isn't, I guess. But where do you draw the line?</p>
<p>The story mentions that nondisclosure agreements are coming to more and more kitchens, but fails to point out why this is: as screwed-up as our IP system is, it actually dealt with these questions before the food industry was sufficiently powerful to corrupt the process. That's why lawyers are now trying to shove all of this stuff into contract law, where you can get away with <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clickwrap_agreement">much more</a>. In other words: it's because the sorts of claims Ms. Charles is making are untenable under IP law.</p>
<p>There's no question that the sous chef is being tacky by copying Charles' restaurant, but it would be very silly to open a Pandora's box by punishing him for copying paint colors. IP laws are there to encourage people to make new things; the market's there to get them to make those things <em>better</em>. These distinctions can get blurry in the world of novel cuisine. But restaurants are fundamentally in the business of selling food, not seeking rent on ideas about food. This story is asinine, and Pete Wells would have done better to highlight how stupid everyone involved is being instead of just making the guy getting sued sound like a jerk.</p>

                    <p>Yesterday Kevin Drum <a class="reference external" href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2007_06/011482.php">quoted a ridiculous excerpt from the Weekly Standard</a> in which Irwin Stelzer frets about CEOs' solidly middle-class-ish income when compared to the titans of Wall Street.</p>
<p>Hilarious as that sentiment is, it may actually be part of a trend. We've had the May issue of <em>Forbes</em> kicking around the office (don't ask me why), and they have a feature on compensation that begins like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">TOP GUNS</div>
<div class="line">Think chief executives get fat paychecks? People who manage piles of money do much better.</div>
</div>
<p>If you fret about the outsize paychecks of America's chief executives, take a look at the kingpins who run private equity and hedge funds. Reaping the rewards of percentage fees, the 20 top Wall Street fund managers earned an average $658 million in 2006 versus $145 million for the 20 highest-paid chief executives. It's almost enough to think the chiefs ought to ask for a raise.</p>
<p>James Simons, who owns an estimates 40% of Renaissance Technologies, sits atop our list with earnings of $1.5 billion. That's $850 million more than the top-earning chief executive, Apple's Steve Jobs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It concludes like so:</p>
<blockquote>
Ever since the days of Cornelius Vanderbilt Wall Street has been a good place to build net worth. There are 16 billionaires on our list of top Wall Street earners but just 4 among the 20 best-paid chief executives.</blockquote>
<p>Those poor fucking guys! And with the rising cost of fuel, do you have any idea how expensive it's becoming to fly the kids to soccer practice on your private jet? That flat tax can't get here soon enough.</p>
<p>Okay, so hedge fund managers are obviously overcompensated. But <em>who cares</em>? The victims of their outsize paychecks are primarily other elites, who simply get a worse return on their investment than they otherwise might. They can take their business elsewhere if they're bothered by this arrangement. But when a company's resources are unjustifiably directed toward the top, many of the people who are negatively affected are typically powerless to do anything about it. <em>That's</em> the problem. CEO whining about how Billy's mom lets him stay up late (on his own private island) is unlikely to convince anyone.</p>
<p>All of which reminds me: <a class="reference external" href="http://www.reason.com/news/show/118315.html">I still need to see 28 Weeks Later</a>.</p>

                    <p>Emily's signed up for the Club For Growth's email list and seems to really enjoy it. I didn't really understand why, and instead simply chalked it up to the Norquistian charisma that some of my other friends have fallen for.</p>
<p>But now I've got my own Club For Growth equivalent, and I think I understand the perverse pleasure she gets from reading awful emails. Particularly when they're obsessed with perversity.</p>
<p>To wit, let me highly recommend the American Family Association's Action Alerts list. It's been delivering hilariously homophobic gems to my inbox ever since <a class="reference external" href="http://blogstretch.blogspot.com/2007/04/little-ambush.html">Amanda's post</a> got me to sign their survey in support of the gay agenda. I don't think I'm ready to give them my real email address, but last night's <a class="reference external" href="http://www.afa.net/sexualorientations.asp">amusingly terrified list of sexual orientations</a> convinced me to re-up their <a class="reference external" href="http://www.spamgourmet.com">SpamGourmet</a> bucket. Heed the words of founder and chairman Donald E. Wildmon says, &quot;Warning! This listing is offensive.&quot;</p>
<p>Still, to their credit and my immense surprise, Google seems to think that the term <em>telephone scatalogia</em> isn't an AFA creation. Might be time to add Latin to the required coursework for a degree in Gender &amp; Sexuality Studies, academy — if you ask me, T.S. is considerably stupider-sounding than the faux-Latin in the Harry Potter books. Trust me, it's much easier to cow people into intellectual submission if they can't understand what the hell you're talking about. Why do you think we geeks come up with so many acronyms?</p>

                    <p>Yesterday Kriston <a class="reference external" href="http://grammarpolice.net/archives/001250.php">linked</a> to <a class="reference external" href="http://volokh.com/archives/archive_2007_03_25-2007_03_31.shtml#1174960427">an interesting post</a> by Ilya Somin over at The Volokh Conspiracy that wondered what the next changes in our cultural morals will be. Nobody thinks that slavery is okay or that women are inferior to men; similarly, it now seems inevitable that homosexuality will eventually be accepted by society. But what will come after that?</p>
<p>Somin identifies animal rights, capital punishment and forced national service as the likeliest candidates. It's a pretty good list, although I think his libertarian instincts may make him overestimate the likelihood of forced national service becoming a real cause celebre. Similarly, my own instincts make me want to believe that the moral and policy case against capital punishment will gain traction soon — but I also suspect that the death penalty's usefulness for podium-thumping means that it's here to stay for a while longer.</p>
<p>The question of animal rights is the most interesting of the three, I think, and one that I can easily imagine becoming a significant cultural issue. Among my peers, at least, I think there's a general sense that animal suffering is bad and should be minimized, but also an understanding that it may be acceptable in some circumstances. Medical testing? Probably. Rhinocerous-horn aphrodisiacs? Probably not. What's the exchange rate between animal suffering and human enjoyment, anyway, and is it weighted by the complexity of the animal's nervous system? I'm not too worried about a bivalve's subjective experience of pain — pig is more problematic (maybe we should breed or engineer stupider ones). What of bacon?! A little bit goes a long way, after all.</p>
<p>Anyway, it does make one wonder whether there's an end point to society's moral evolution or whether this will be an endless process. It's clear that we haven't yet arrived at what you or I or most people would define as a completely just society. But it also seems likely that someday we'll slip into fuddy-duddy-dom and have our own sense of social justice eclipsed by earnest door-to-door canvassers campaigning for, I don't know, the right to urinate in public. We'll think that we and we alone were fit to judge the right stopping place for the march of progress. No doubt our great-grandparents thought the same thing.</p>
<p>Alternately, maybe we'll someday reach an endpoint. We'll all shuttle through pneumatic tubes in silver jumpsuits and androgenously shaved heads, confident that that there are good and immutable reasons for the few remaining limits on personal liberty that we impose on one another. I've got no idea which scenario will triumph. I'm pretty confident that I'll be dead by the time it all shakes out.</p>
<p>What'll actually be relevant (and at least somewhat related) are the new advances in rebelliousness implemented by the lousy teenagers that many of us will eventually spawn. There's obviously an element of unpredictability here — you wouldn't want to defy social norms in a way that can be anticipated by the squares, after all — but the range of innovatively outrageous teenage behaviors that are at all practical seem to be diminishing. I suppose that the biological realities of parenting make sexuality, tattoos and drug use sort of evergreen options for misunderstood teenagers. But those are also all pretty common in our popular culture. To <em>really</em> be at the forefront of rebellion the kids will have to come up with something new.</p>
<p>My money's on voluntary limb amputation. I predict a sudden uptic in the incidence of <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apotemnophilia">BIID</a>, a rash of shocked newscasts, and a lot of impassioned essays about the limits of the ADA. It's going to be really irritating and, to me and my fellow liberal paternalists, more than a little tragic. Our only hope is for cyborg modification to become feasible first. As you can probably guess, I'm a bit more bullish on that issue.</p>
