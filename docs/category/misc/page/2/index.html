                    <p>Yglesias <a class="reference external" href="http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/archives/2009/12/memo-to-michael-wolff-bitch-is-a-sexist-term.php">responds</a> to Michael Wolff's ruminations on Chuck Schumer calling a flight attendant a bitch:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...by eliding the term “bitch” he manages to completely avoid the subject of sexism, which I think is at the core of the complaint here. But the term is a pure contentless gender-slur. It’s like you’re saying “I disagree with what you’re doing and also you’re a woman which is a bad thing to be!!!!!!!!”</p>
<p>Even if a woman is doing something legitimately bad, it’s no more appropriate to insult her with that term than it is to break out a racial slur just because a guy you have a legitimate beef with happens to be black. That’s the issue here.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Disclaimer: &quot;bitch&quot; is not a term I like nor one that I use. When I hear other people use it, I think less of them.</p>
<p>But I'm not sure that what Yglesias says above is correct. I wrote something about this years ago, but it came out hopelessly muddled, so let's try again.</p>
<p>The difficulty here is in figuring out what we find objectionable about the word. It's easy to become confused by the fact that pejorative language is reserved for unpleasant situations, and give in to the temptation to think that wishing away the word will also make those situations disappear. Yglesias understands that this is stupid way of thinking: people will continue to get upset with one another. And although it's obvious that we should all strive to be pleasant human beings, there's nothing necessarily unjust about expressing your strong dislike for someone. Rather, it's the act of denigration-via-classification embodied by these terms that makes them so odious. This is also correct, I think.</p>
<p>But the comparison to racist language is problematic. It seems to me that as a society we've pretty much decided that acknowledging racial differences is inappropriate except in very specific circumstances. It sounds a little weird when you put it that way, but I think it's essentially what we've done and that it's basically a good idea -- a custom that pushes human behavior in positive directions.</p>
<p>It's not clear to me that a similar societal decision has been made with respect to gender differences. I say this primarily because most people continue to think it's fine to use gendered pronouns. And if that's all right, I don't necessarily see an inherent problem with gendered pejoratives (though certainly there can be circumstances surrounding their use that are profoundly problematic -- the practical case against the word &quot;bitch&quot; is quite strong, I think). Heroine/hero, she/he, bitch/dick. There's a low-resolution take on the continuum. The fact that only the last pair would strike most people as objectionable makes me think that we're facing the situation I talked about above: wishing that people wouldn't get angry with one another and use harsh language. That's a fine thing to wish for, but I don't think it's got much to do with social justice.</p>
<p>The other possibility, of course, is that we should be objecting to gendered pronouns with positive or neutral affect (e.g. heroine, she) as well, just the same as we don't use different words for valorous people of different races. I think this is probably correct, but I also think it's probably not a position that most of the people engaging in this debate would find appealing enough on an intuitive level to embrace. Come to think of it, resistance to the social project of eliminating gendered pronouns could easily be the thing that eventually earns the &quot;cultural conservative&quot; trophy for my generation (take heart, though, future young people: we'll be dead before you know it).</p>

                    <p>I still have a whopping seventeen minutes to go until I need to head to the morning's first meeting (I am told there will be pastry), but Twitter means that I <em>already</em> have compelling internet content to share. To wit!</p>

I realize this was part of the appeal, even as I simultaneously realize that (having not been a part of the Fugazi fanbase at the time of their relevance) I shouldn't claim to fully understand their appeal. Still, forget the humorlessness, the stories about straight-edge-inspired violence, the earnest para-anarchist nonsense. Just listen to the self-satisfied incredulity in that stage banter (banter admittedly being entirely the wrong word in this case). It's hard to listen to it without cringing for ever having been young.</p>

<div class="line"><a class="reference external" href="http://www.avclub.com/dc/articles/john-davis-defends-his-nonguilty-pleasures,35822/">John Davis</a>, on the other hand, proves himself to be kind of a sweetheart, even as he correctly identifies the flaws in the musical abominations that he's decided to stick up for, seemingly because he simply rejects the idea of negativity entirely. I mean, <em>The Pina Colada Song</em>? That's bold. But it's also sort of strangely big-hearted, and makes me tempted to compare Davis to my friend Chris, which Chris doesn't like because he worries that people with beards all look the same to the rest of us, and that's prejudice.</div>
<div class="line">There is one problem with Davis' interview, though, and it leaves me in the awkward position of needing to stick up for Dan Snyder. Davis makes the same claim as <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Snyder#Six_Flags_theme_park">Wikipedia</a>:</div>
</div>
</p><!--  -->
<blockquote>
<p>Snyder eliminated the popular Mr. Six character from Six Flags commercials <sup>[citation needed]</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Citation desperately needed! Snyder bought the park in 2005, and I'm certain I've seen Mr. Six dancing away his bankruptcy worries since then. More importantly, it should go without saying that the character was never popular, and rarely even tolerable.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>During my Artomatic shift on Saturday I finished Charles Stross's <em>The Atrocity Archives</em>, the first in a series of scifi novels that I heard of via Paul Krugman's blog, of all places. The book's conceit is appealing: certain mathematical constructions possess mystical powers — often dangerous ones. Our humble protagonist is part of a highly specialized, highly secret, and highly bureaucratic arm of the British government devoted to suppressing such dangerous technology. It's Lovecraft + spy thriller + ironic office comedy — brazenly so, to the point where the author breaks down his influences in an irritating postscript essay. Still, it was an enjoyable read.</p>
<p>As an unexpected bonus (though I probably should have seen it coming), the book's villains include a cadre of Nazi occultists, the sorts of guys who'd love to see a restoration of the Reich, but who, if that doesn't work out, would be perfectly content to settle for the apocalypse. If you've heard me prattle on about Hellboy you know that crazed Nazi sorcerors are among my all-time favorite pulp bad guys (seriously: how much more villainy can you ask of a villain?). So this was a pleasant way for the book to turn out.</p>
<p>It got me thinking, though, that there must be some source text that discusses the Nazis' bizarre forays into the occult which has influenced people like Charles Stross, Mike Mignola, and anyone else who's penned a story about Hyperborea, the Spear of Destiny or other WWII-era mystical weirdness. So naturally I started plopping search terms into Amazon, hoping to find a definitive account of the aforementioned malevolent hoodoo.</p>
<p>I'm still looking, but have at least stumbled on an interesting tangent: judging by the name, it's entirely possible that the Nazis' secret occult society escaped the war, laid low, and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mozilla-20&amp;index=blended&amp;link_code=qs&amp;field-keywords=thule&amp;sourceid=Mozilla-search">is now manufacturing car luggage</a>. More as this story develops.</p>

But it isn't really necessary. Believe me: if you get a police report filed about your accident (and of course you should — nothing makes an insurance agent happier), personal injury scumbags will wriggle out of the woodwork and plop themselves onto your voicemail almost immediately. When it happened to me I found it pretty annoying, but I suppose it's nice to know that cyclists' rights will be protected.</p>
<p>But a legal jihad against drivers won't change anything. At this point I'm convinced that the only way to make cities bike-friendly is to put fellow travelers (so to speak) into positions of power, <a class="reference external" href="http://nymag.com/news/features/56794/">like they've done in NYC</a>.</p>

                    <p>Emily and I both read and enjoyed <em>World War Z</em> at the beach. Emily enjoyed it enough to ask that <em>The Zombie Survival Guide</em> be included among her birthday loot, and it was probably the spirit of that book that led us to discuss the technical specifics of vampire abatement strategies.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, no consensus could be reached, so it falls to you, internet, to weigh in on the feasibility of killing a vampire by driving one of the following objects through its heart:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Painted wood (latex/oil/lacquer (e.g. a pool cue))</li>
<li>Particle board</li>
<li>Frozen sawdust and water (<a class="reference external" href="http://dsc.discovery.com/fansites/mythbusters/articles/what-is-pykrete.html">see also</a>)</li>
<li>A cone of tightly-wrapped paper</li>
</ol>
<p>Posit that sufficient force is available to overcome problems related to each material's sharpness — we are killing these vampires in a laboratory setting, and for the sake of this argument can safely dismiss practical concerns.</p>
<p>Emily felt strongly that the wood's semantic status was the primary factor at work, leaving her convinced that option one was the only viable method of disposing of the undead. I disagree completely: I think there must be a chemical mechanism at work, which leads me to expect that methods two and three would unquestionably work, and that method four stands a good chance as well. But I have grave concerns about the use of laminated wood, and frankly am surprised that more vampire fiction doesn't make use of actually-that-stake-was-painted-now-I'm-going-to-bite-you-(SURPRISE!) trope that it makes possible.</p>
<p>What say you, internet? Remember to show your work.</p>

                    <p>With apologies to my MBA-possessing friends: <a class="reference external" href="http://www.abc.net.au/rn/backgroundbriefing/stories/2009/2526727.htm">the case against MBAs</a>.</p>
<p>Not that the degree's really worthless, of course. As the above-linked transcript acknowledges, it's an admission ticket to certain spheres of money and power. And the introduction to financial and economic concepts that the associated coursework provides is something I frequently wish I had. But while I won't say that I outright <em>dismissed</em> any resumes because of it — that wouldn't be very responsible of me — seeing the degree on a programmer's resume has definitely prompted me to record a mental strike against them.</p>
<p>In that case it's because I was specifically looking looking for focused technicians. But speaking more broadly, I think the folks quoted in the above-linked transcript are right when they discuss how the brand of generalism afforded by a business education — as distinct from the type produced by a liberal arts education — can be pretty grating to the rest of us, particularly when it's wielded by someone unaware of its limitations. Fortunately, nearly all of the MBAs I know are quick to acknowledge those limits; most of them <em>do</em> have an education in something substantial; and none of them, so far as I know, willingly read management books.</p>
<p>Anti-business sentiment is obviously at its high water mark right now; other than our normal societal baseline of simmering anti-authoritarianism, we shouldn't expect it to last. But for anyone who's worked under a hapless b-school acolyte, the last few months have been something of a golden age. That they're producing radio programs embodying this resentment (rather than just NBC sitcoms) seems noteworthy.</p>

<p>Gag me with a spoon from some little hole in the wall after-hours place in the LES that was supposed to just serve falafel but actually it started to have these awful high school bands sometimes and if you knew the guy he'd sell you big paper cups of Turkish beer and when I tell people this story now I usually say it turned into a Hot Topic because that's funnier but actually I just started hating how young everyone there seemed to be.</p>

It did leave me wondering about another point, though: whether the availability of this sort of back channel is one of the factors that's led to the blogosphere's diminished vibrancy.</p>
<p>There's an obvious advantage to moving the social and argument-refining functions of online conversation to a venue where participants aren't exposed to the risks of misinterpretation, prudishness or unreasonably high expectations. Opting for a listserv post instead of a trackback means no public castigation for stupid mistakes and no worrying about an occasional thoughtless (or just really funny) remark getting you in trouble with your employer. And, as Ezra points out, it's better to have wary experts offer their wisdom in private than not at all. Besides, it's not like participants are giving up much by foregoing the contributions of the slack-jawed commentariat during this process (aside: I remain baffled by well-meaning web triumphalists' calls for the use of technology to enable more direct participation in the policy process — have they spent <em>any</em> time in blog comment sections?).</p>
<p>It's hard to begrudge anyone this sort of professional conservatism, particularly when their industry is in turmoil. I certainly engage in similar behaviors when I find them advantageous. But it does seem likely to me that there's a homogenizing effect that comes from blog-labor-saving devices like mailing lists and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.memeorandum.com/">memeorandum</a>. As a fan of these writers I'm glad for anything that makes their work easier, but as a member of the reading public I have to admit: it's kind of a drag to know that the blogosphere's efforts to improve itself have led to its audience being protected from so much interesting content.</p>

This is a topic that fascinates me — I've <a class="reference external" href="/2007/10/10/wealth-but-no-wages/">poked at</a> it <a class="reference external" href="/2007/04/20/giant-nazi-robots/">before</a>, but of course Matt's take is considerably smarter and more rigorous than any conclusions I've ever reached. His perspective also happens to be cheerier than my own — I remain somewhat pessimistic about the ultimate economic consequences of these changes, even as I find myself looking forward to their effect on our society.</p>
<p>The good news, though, is that I don't actually know anything about economics, so for now let's all just assume that everything will be fine.</p>

                    <p>We live in a pretty Jehovah's-Witness-heavy neighborhood, but I mostly don't mind. Sure, it means the occasional well-meaning pair of Sunday visitors will find me groggily staring at them, potentially shirtless. But that's mostly their problem — I'm perfectly happy to see them. Besides, you never know when you'll find yourself wishing you had a few dozen copies of <em>The Watchtower</em> on hand.</p>
<p>The best side effect, though, are the hand-addressed notes I get in the mail, which contain handwritten notes, which contain printed tracts, and all of which contain numerous spelling and grammatical errors. Still, they're preferable to the ones I used to find placed under my windshield wipers back when I had the car with <a class="reference external" href="http://flickr.com/photos/sbma44/89423228/in/set-72057594051841686/">the awful front-end damage</a>; those would encourage me to seek help for my alcoholism (lucky guesses don't count!).</p>
<p>Anyway, here's the latest one I've received. In most respects it's pretty unremarkable, but does make a case for Bible study that I don't remember encountering before: that it will protect you from <em>zombies and/or ghosts</em>. Possibly also draculas; I'm not sure, it's been a while since Sunday School.</p>

But this mean-spiritedness has got to stop. Yes, it's clear that Vince had been awake for at least 50 hours when that commercial was filmed. And yes, he is an <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vince_Offer">ex-Scientologist who sued Anna Nicole Smith for breach of contract</a> in relation to his failed gross-out comedy movie (the New York Times called it &quot;<a class="reference external" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9805EFDF1F31F93BA15756C0A96F958260&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=underground+comedy+movie&amp;st=nyt">a monument to ineptitude and self-delusion</a>&quot;).</p>
<p>But what's the alternative? This is a subject that Charles, Emily and I have discussed at length. Vince may not be perfect — he's just a human being, as flawed and beautiful as any of us — but at least he has the guts to stand up to Billy Mays and the grasping tentacles of his infomercial syndicate.</p>
<p>Now, I'll be the first to acknowledge Mr. Mays' impressive achievements. But his time has passed; it's clear that these days, his heart's not in it. Worse, his <a class="reference external" href="http://www.asseenontvvideo.com/487/Zorbeez.html">Zorbeez project</a> is a transparent attempt to destroy Vince and the ShamWow, no matter the cost (how else can one explain his proffer of a $60 value for a mere $14.99?!). Doesn't America deserve a fresh new face to sell us oddly-shaped cooking implements and citrus-based cleaning products? Can we really sanction the sort of anticompetitive behavior that Mr. Mays represents?</p>
<p>I say yes! And no! Respectively! Vince may not deserve your love, but when, every night, his shaking hands remove that headset — in that moment he at least deserves your respect. And your order, of course. Call now.</p>

                    <p>It's no secret that <a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/cshirky/status/998786410">the newspaper industry is in trouble</a>. Still, give our hometown paper credit for trying new business models. Last week we saw the Post <a class="reference external" href="http://dcist.com/2008/11/05/special_edition_washington_post_to.php">move strongly into the &quot;collectible knick-knack&quot; market</a>. This week? <a class="reference external" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/11/12/AR2008111200658_pf.html">They're trying their hand at becoming a network security firm / law enforcement agency</a> (this via <a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/tbridge/status/1002184031">Tom Bridge</a>.</p>
<p>Snark aside, this really is a pretty impressive accomplishment for a journalist. Brian Krebs' reporting led directly to a major spam colocation facility getting knocked offline by its upstream bandwidth providers. The result is reportedly a staggering <a class="reference external" href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/securityfix/2008/11/major_source_of_online_scams_a.html">75% overnight drop in net-wide spam</a>. That won't last, of course, but it's still awfully impressive. (Incidentally, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.zunta.org/blog/archives/2006/02/18/interposse/">this isn't the first time</a> that the Post has caused trouble for botnet operators.)</p>
<p>Not to diminish Krebs' accomplishment, but the ease with which this was done — a civilian making some phone calls, basically — also hints at the lameness of our law enforcement agencies' online efforts. This was a U.S. company that was plainly harboring illegal activity. Krebs spoke to some security researchers who let him know about it, then he called the folks providing the malefactors' network connections. Those providers said &quot;wow! you're right!&quot; and pulled the plug. It took time, initiative, and cleverness (the threat of Krebs' bully pulpit helped, no doubt), but it didn't take any warrants or indictments.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the people nominally charged with prosecuting these sorts of crimes are — what? Posing as sexy teens in chatrooms? Fretting about cyberterrorism? It was, admittedly, the Army, not law enforcement, that published the recent <a class="reference external" href="http://www.breitbart.com/article.php?id=081025182242.js2g2op8&amp;show_article=1">asinine report examining Twitter's capacity for supporting terrorists' activities</a>. Still, that mindset seems to be pervasive: people just don't get very excited about going after online criminals who steal money and productivity. Instead electronic crime needs to be blown up into an existential threat — it's about terrorists! Or hostile foreign governments! Or sexual predators! What it really is is a waste of time and money.</p>

                    <p>Before the global economy ended and the dollar recovered, there was a lot of talk about why our currency had begun performing so poorly relative to the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.x-rates.com/d/EUR/USD/hist2008.html">Euro</a> and the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.x-rates.com/d/GBP/USD/hist2008.html">British Pound</a>.

The best thing you can say for these designs is that the implied alternate history in which all US Presidents were zombies is kind of a funny idea.</p>

                    <p>I feel like I'm waking up. That probably sounds grandiose — that's not what I mean. Yes, I'm excited about last night's win and what it means for the country. I'm very ready to be rid of the stomach-sinking thought that my government is torturing people on my behalf. But the election's primary effect on my state of mind has just been to make me feel embarrassingly maudlin every quarter-hour. It doesn't really account for my present disorientation.</p>
<p>That sensation has more to do with how much <em>stuff</em> it feels like I've been doing. Some of it was about the election, but an embarrassing amount was Halloween-related. I enjoy that holiday to an extent that can only be described as idiotic, and I probably took on a bit too much this year. Still, the smoke chillers and corpsed skeleton are now safely stored for next year's installment — an undefined project that I currently find incredibly daunting, and yet already know will have to involve animatronics.</p>
<p>But for now: a return to routine. A wait for the inauguration. Early bedtimes!</p>
<p>First, though, some photos. I managed to take exactly none during the Halloween party, but a bunch of other people did — you can find 'em <a class="reference external" href="http://flickr.com/photos/tags/fickeween">here</a>, if you haven't already. And here's a shot of me and Emily:</p>

<p>I have to cherish whatever opportunities I can find to be the one in this relationship called &quot;doctor&quot;.</p>
<p>More topical: last night's celebration on U Street. Wherever you were when you heard the news last night, I hope there was as much joy on hand as there was in DC.</p>

A more persistent puzzlement: why haven't I spent more time geeking out over, say, The Rockers with Spencer? Between the grittiness, emotion and highbrow disdain, pro wrestling seems suited to his unique style of connoisseurship in a number of ways.</p>

                    <p>Halloween! Words! Contest! Okay, inspiration.</p>
<p>I'm a big fan of old-timey radio — it's just one facet of my having been approximately 80 years old since birth. I am deeply resentful of the fact that <a class="reference external" href="http://wamu.org/programs/bb/">The Big Broadcast</a> doesn't provide podcasts, and am prepared to draft a curt letter to that effect on my IBM Selectric. Perhaps I'll send it to my local paper's editor.</p>
<p>The best old-time radio isn't very spooky, it's true — cowboys, detectives and comedy teams are the order of the day. There are a decent number of supernatural programs, but WAMU tends not to play them. Those that I've found online are almost all awful. One exception, though, is <em>Beyond Midnight</em>. I won't claim to be a connoisseur, but it seems to be pretty good, aside from the discordant shilling for a defunct laundry additive named Bio-tex (which is sort of fun in its own right). And it's considerably easier to listen to than even the audiobooks I've posted in the past — creeping woodwinds and alarmed brass can go a long way toward punctuating a tale of fright.</p>
<p>Here's an episode that I particularly liked. Emily and I shut off all the lights and listened to it over dinner, and it was great.</p>

                    <p>I've been remiss. I apologize. It's just that I've been busy: with work and meetings, but also with getting sick. It's not, I'm pleased to report, one of my signature cardiovascular ailments — no, this seems to be a Cosi-born illness, and so far has just made me tired and in need of a more manly alternative to the phrase &quot;my tummy hurts&quot;. Also, Charles and I have been having something of a Halo 3 renaissance, and that's taken up a fair amount of time.</p>
<p>But all regularly scheduled activities continue: chief among them the Halloween short story contest. I've made some progress on mine, and can now assure you that as a fiction writer I am both long-winded and <em>terrible</em>. Still, it's something.</p>
<p>The essential details, for those only now paying attention: the deadline is a week from today; there's no minimum length; stories may be submitted anonymously; and the winner of the resulting popular vote gets $100. It's easy.</p>
<p>My absence from the internet stopped me from posting more inspirational Halloweeniana, so now I'm going to have to pick up the pace. My last offering was <a class="reference external" href="/2008/10/08/childhood-terror/">particularly lame</a>, so let's return to one of the classics: M.R. James.</p>
<p>Some of James' stories are pretty creepy — <a class="reference external" href="http://gaslight.mtroyal.ca/jamesX05.htm">The Ash-Tree</a> is probably the best one I've read on that score — but that's not the thing about his work that I most enjoy. James taught at King's College and Eton, and composed many of his stories as part of the English tradition of telling ghost stories at Christmas Eve (yuletide, they call it, just to further British things up). It's a tradition I'd never heard of before, but one that sounds pretty great.</p>
<p>As you might imagine, James was bit of a tweedy academic; naturally, many of his protagonists are, too. Their tales generally go something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">&quot;Ho there, Wedgelington! What brings you to the Antiquities Department of Chestlethwick College?&quot;</div>
<div class="line">&quot;Well met, Asterforthe, old bean! To your question: as you can see, it's this blasted urn I've happened across while touring the countryside. By the queerness of the inscriptions I presume it to be Etruscan, or Norse, or perhaps Oriental in nature...&quot;</div>
<div class="line">&quot;Yes, I expect you're right...&quot;</div>
<div class="line">&quot;...But for the life of me I can't prise the infernal thing open! I find myself confounded — utterly flummoxed!&quot;</div>
<div class="line">&quot;Perhaps if I just use this ornate silver dagger...&quot;</div>
</div>
<p class="attribution">&mdash;—AN UNPLEASANT INTERLUDE COMMENCES——</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">&quot;Well! That was certainly a rollicking supernatural adventure!&quot;</div>
<div class="line">&quot;Quite so.&quot;</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a bit unfair. Even if James' supernatural horrors lack some of the existential threat of later authors, they're still plenty spooky. His stories have satisfyingly unambiguous conclusions, but still manage to express themselves with nuance. The foreshadowing is immediately identifiable, but not irritatingly so. The pacing gets to the point, but isn't hurried.</p>
<p>They're good, solid ghost stories — and oh so British. If you've ever watched the Indiana Jones movies and wished that <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Brody#Marcus_Brody">Marcus Brody</a> had been given his own spin-off, then you'll probably enjoy these.</p>
<p>More good news: James' work is in the public domain, and many of the stories are available as free recordings, courtesy of Librivox. The narrator is Peter Yearsley, whose British accent and languid style complement the text perfectly. <a class="reference external" href="http://librivox.org/ghost-stories-of-an-antiquary-by-m-r-james/">Here are the audio versions of James' first major collection</a>. I suggest downloading them and sticking them on your iPod for the next time you're traveling at night.</p>
<p>I suppose I should pick one story, though, so we may as well go with <em>Oh, Whistle, and Iâ€™ll Come to You, My Lad</em>. It embodies all of the Jamesian traits I described above, is considered among his best efforts, and has an <strong>incredibly creepy title</strong> (borrowed from a Robert Burns poem, but still).</p>

                    <p>Tim's <a class="reference external" href="http://arstechnica.com/articles/culture/future-of-driving-part-2.ars">article about the social changes that self-driving cars might make possible</a> is fascinating reading (so is his <a class="reference external" href="http://arstechnica.com/articles/culture/future-of-driving-part-1.ars">earlier installment of the series</a>, in which Tim discusses the history and present state of robotic car technology). But I wonder about <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ryanavent.com/blog/?p=1508">the conclusion that Ryan draws from it</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">I think the net effect of autonomous vehicles on suburban areas would be to make them denser (I think the net effect of a lot of things on suburban areas will be to make them denser). As important as those shifts, I suspect, would be the boon such vehicles would be to explicitly urban areas.</div>
<div class="line">Taxis and car-sharing services are very much complements to walkable urban life. Cheap and effective autonomous vehicles would likewise be complements to urban life, but in a much more significant manner. Itâ€™s hard to overstate the negative effect of parking on dense, urban areas. When fighting against dense, new development, NIMBYs cite parking and traffic concerns first, second, and third. Given the value of urban land, parking has massive opportunity costs. Street space in urban areas is very limited and is currently given over almost entirely to driving lanes and parking lanes. If self-driving vehicles freed up much of that space, it would make room for large increases in transit right-of-way, bike lanes, and sidewalk space.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>I think the less parking/more density argument being put forth is a bit optimistic. Obviously self-driving cars would be phased into the fleet on the road slowly. So long as that's the case, it's hard to see how self-rearranging, super-dense parking lots can be made to work. We'll have to wait for the entire fleet to turn over — a process that, given the steadily increasing quality of modern cars, will take longer and longer as we wait for robot cars to arrive. I can see how a car that's easier to share — or even just one that can drop you off and then go its merry way — could help reduce the amount of parking we need and build. But it doesn't seem likely to make a significant difference during my lifetime.</p>
<p>The more immediate consequence is this, though: if automated carsharing drives down the cost of taking a trip in a private vehicle (you don't have to pay for the full upkeep or purchase of the vehicle, or pay for a driver's time); and if not having to spend time piloting the car drives down the personal cost even further, won't that encourage more trips in private cars? And won't that actually encourage suburban settlement patterns?</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong: I think self-piloting cars will be a boon to everyone. It's just hard for me to see how easier locomotion from arbitrary point to arbitrary point will push people toward the dense settlement patterns that Ryan favors. There's a widespread perception that city schools are bad and that having a yard is nice. I really like living in a city, but I'm not sure that either of those ideas is wrong. If you tell people they can have it all — and better, that it'll all be delivered BY ROBOTS — they'll take you up on the offer.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>Yesterday I tweeted this video, in which a bottle is neatly divided by tying a string around it, igniting the string, and plunging the bottle into cold water. The thermal shock causes the heated portion to fracture, producing a surprisingly clean break.</p>
<p>I'm in the market for some cheap candleholders, you see. I ordered a bunch of votive candles yesterday for the Halloween party, but getting glass holders would have drastically increased the shipping cost, so Emily and I decided to improvise. Something a bit less uniformly shaped will probably look creepier, too.</p>
<p>Cut beer bottles are an appealing option, since we produce those at a much faster clip than we do, say, tiny perfectly-shaped food jars. <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cowtown.net/mikefirth/bottle.htm">This page</a> seems to be a pretty definitive clearinghouse of information on how to cut bottles. Even though the author expressed skepticism about it, the burning string method sounded appealing to me. Or cheap, anyway.</p>
<p>Well, I gave it a shot yesterday. Eventually, it worked:</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/2928764771/"><img alt="Magic bottle cutting: the results" class="center" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3036/2928764771_7d66d4279d.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: 375px;" /></a></p>
<p>It took about ten attempts, though. It does seem like the sort of thing that, with practice, could be mastered. What made the difference for me was banging the bottle into the sink's bottom as I plunged it into the water. But it didn't work when I tried it again with another bottle, and at that point I gave up.</p>
<p>There are other problems with the method, too. You'll need to wear gloves and eye protection, of course, and work in a ventilated area, which can be a pain to find and set up. On my successful attempt the top of the bottle shattered, which was contained by the water but still not fun to clean up. Acetone isn't all that pleasant a thing to work with, and will inevitably get on your gloves, requiring you to take them off before lighting the string. Alternately you can keep a candle burning from which to light the string, as I did, but then you'll have to be sure to keep it clear of the acetone. And of course you still might light your gloves on fire if you aren't careful.</p>
<p>In short: it doesn't work that well, and it's kind of a pain in the ass. I think we'll be pestering friends to save jars after all.</p>

                    <p>Alright! The <a class="reference external" href="/2008/09/24/competitive-spookiness/">Halloween story contest</a> continues, and so does my posting of sources of inspiration / incessant pestering.</p>
<p>So far I've put up stuff from <a class="reference external" href="/2008/09/24/competitive-spookiness/">Hellboy</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.manifestdensity.net/2008/09/26/the_most_terrifying_thing_abou/">Lovecraft</a> and <a class="reference external" href="/2008/10/06/continuing-halloweeniana/">Poe</a>, and my plan was to continue in that vein. But I think that three classic horror authors in a row would be a bit too much. What are we, fancy? Instead, let's take a break to laugh at my expense.</p>
<p>I didn't watch a lot of scary movies growing up, but the few I saw were enough to provide a reliable font of terror into adolescence. One is <a class="reference external" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090887/">Critters</a>, which a cruel babysitter watched on our local UHF station while taking care of me, and which I still think is probably a sort-of-legitimately frightening movie (though I haven't watched it since). The other one involves Garfield.</p>
<p>I thought for a long time that it was the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garfield%27s_Halloween_Adventure">Garfield Halloween special</a> that had freaked me out, but the internet insists that I'm wrong. Having googled around a bit, things have become clearer. That (Emmy award winning!) special had a scary old man and some decent ghosts, but it wasn't the sort of thing that'd really traumatize a little kid. It turns out that I was thinking of the TV adaptation of <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garfield:_His_9_Lives">Garfield: His 9 Lives</a>, a collection of Garfield-inspired short stories that seems to have been the high point of literary pretension related to the Garfield phenomenon.</p>
<p>Some of the stories are comic, but this one is actually sorta spooky, and downright terrifying by when judged by the sensibilities of an eight year-old. I still don't do well with things-transforming-into-other-things.</p>
<p>So yeah, ha ha, that little kid's Garfield-related horror is very funny. Easy to say if you didn't see the TV special! But think back and consider your childhood reaction to... <a class="reference external" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084649/">The Secret of NIMH</a>!</p>
<p>Not so brave now, are you, tough guy?</p>

Despite this, a few more folks have expressed interest to me privately. The supernatural literary juggernaut presses onward! Remember: the deadline is October 27 — that's three weeks from today — and the democratically-determined winner gets a hundred bucks.</p>
<p>Now! On to more sources of spooky inspiration. I said I'd be heading backward in time, and I'm sticking to that. We started off with <a class="reference external" href="/2008/09/24/competitive-spookiness/">Hellboy</a>, then touched on <a class="reference external" href="http://www.manifestdensity.net/2008/09/26/the_most_terrifying_thing_abou/">Lovecraft</a>, the latter being a major source of inspiration for the former. Let's do the same thing for Lovecraft and talk about the author that most influenced him: Poe. I know, I know: it's obvious. But it's also unavoidable. I mean, c'mon — just <em>look</em> at the guy.</p>
<p>I picked up a copy of Poe's collected works this spring, and have been intermittently working through his short stories since then. Here's the thing: a lot of them aren't really very scary. Some of his most famous works, like <em>The Pit and the Pendulum</em>, are relatively shallow, shlocky nonsense that reads like it was plotted by an eleven year-old.</p>
<p>Of course, many others are more effective. But even when reading those better stories I frequently find myself thinking that the protagonist would have benefited from growing up under the regime of an older brother, whose cheerful abuse might've forced his younger sibling not to be such an unbelievable wuss.</p>
<p>But that's the point, really, and what makes Poe relevant. In his best stories the terror he describes is almost exclusively psychological in nature: if only the narrator could control his unsteady nerves, or escape his obsession, or even just smoke a bit less opium, everything might be okay. But he can't, so it won't.</p>
<p>The guy's also got a knack for doomed love stories. Or, more precisely, stories that occupy a doomed love affair's epilogue, when hope is gone but a terrifying supernatural ambiguity is just beginning. Those are the ones I like best. Luckily for me there are a surprising number that fit this description — including, of course, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.videosift.com/video/The-Simpsons-The-Raven">The Raven</a>. But my favorite non-animated work is <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Ligeia">Ligeia</a>, which is not only a good exemplar of the form but also includes the poem <em>The Conqueror Worm</em>, which is pretty great in its own right (and which has also served as inspiration for <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Hellboy-Vol-5-Conqueror-Worm/dp/1593070926/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1223316613&amp;sr=8-1">a Hellboy story</a>).</p>
<p>Poe's pleasantly located in the public domain, so there are a bunch of ways to get the story:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>There's the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Ligeia">online text</a>, of course.</li>
<li>There's also a <a class="reference external" href="http://librivox.org">Librivox</a> audio recording of it (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.archive.org/download/story_5_librivox/ligeia_poe_py_64kb.mp3">64kbps mp3</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.archive.org/download/story_5_librivox/ligeia_poe_py.mp3">128kbps mp3</a>). Convenient, but Poe's filigreed sentences are essential to conveying his narrator's state of mind, and they're hard to follow when read in the deliberate manner of Librivox contributor Peter Yearsley. (Yearsley's style works well on some other stories, though, so I intend to get back to him.)</li>
<li>Finally, if you've got an iPhone or iPod Touch you should really go grab <a class="reference external" href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=284956128&amp;mt=8">Stanza</a>, a free book reader that makes available a large and similarly-cost-free collection of public domain works via Feedbooks. Incidentally, if you have a Kindle or Sony reader (or just something that takes PDFs), <a class="reference external" href="http://www.feedbooks.com/book/783">Feedbooks has you covered</a>, too, no extra app required.</li>
</ul>
<p>Okay! Enough with the big names. Next time we'll creep forward, then lurch fully back into the twentieth century. Then I don't know what, but it'll be scary.</p>

                    <p>Although everyone's keeping a low profile so far, I'm encouraged by the interest expressed to me privately about the <a class="reference external" href="/2008/09/24/competitive-spookiness/">Halloween story contest</a>. I think this'll be fun.</p>
<p>So let's press onward! As promised, I'm going to post a bunch of spooky stuff in order to provide both inspiration and a gentle kick in the ass. I think I'm going to start this process by heading back in time from <a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/30858603&#64;N08/sets/72157607468306330/show/with/2885384174/">the Hellboy comic</a> that started the process.</p>
<p>The Hellboy universe has a lot of influences, and Mike Mignola swings between them pretty wildly. But more than anyone else, the book owes a debt to H.P. Lovecraft. Sometimes this is explicit — the BPRD <em>Plague of Frogs</em> storyline could be fairly called an adaptation of <em>The Shadow Over Innsmouth</em> (which we'll get to later). But the most important idea taken from Lovecraft is atmospheric in nature.</p>
<p>Lovecraft's probably best known for making our pop fright-fest aesthetic include more tentacles than it used to. That's not his real innovation, though. Before Lovecraft, horror was mostly about deviation from the normal — about the horrible things that might exist, things which put themselves at odds with virtue and far from god. Lovecraft pointed out that if there is a god — well, first of all, that should probably be pluralized — and second of all, it's pretty presumptuous for us to assume that they care for mankind or the world we've built. Human society and its idea of goodness is a pleasant anomaly; one we're born into loving and defending, but one that has little in common with the essential cold vastness of the universe. We are so, so tiny. It's probably too much to ask for even <em>indifference</em> from the unknowable forces that dwarf us. Why should we be the only thing with intents and ends? We may just be the only thing that flatters itself by bothering to call those ends benevolent.</p>
<p>Put another way: if you've ever found yourself standing outside on a dark, cloudless night and paused to imagine the radio waves from our civilization and the heat from your body commingling as they radiate into space, the photons soon to be lost forever in endless cold — and better that than for them to be noticed by something else, something incomprehensible and uncompassionate — if you've ever thought something like that, shivered, and then hurried inside, you probably owe H.P. Lovecraft a royalty payment.</p>
<p>Lovecraft said that the story he liked best of those he ever wrote was<em>The Colour Out Of Space</em>. Although it's not directly related to his more famous works within the Cthulhu mythos, it is as emblematic of his sense of cosmic dread as anything else I've read. Here's the text:</p>
<blockquote>
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Colour_Out_of_Space">H.P. Lovecraft – The Colour Out Of Space</a></blockquote>
<p>iPhone owners may also be interested in installing <a class="reference external" href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=284956128&amp;mt=8">Stanza</a>, a free book reader application that has <em>The Colour Out Of Space</em> available through its Feedbooks catalog.</p>
<p>Boo!</p>

                    <p>So! Halloween is fast approaching, and as some of you know, <a class="reference external" href="http://twinkle.tapulous.com/index.php?id=2106255">preparations are well underway</a>. I'd like to try something new this year, though: let's have a spooky story contest. Folks will submit their stories — anonymously, if they'd like — and we'll all read and vote on them during the week leading up to Halloween (non-robotically, I hasten to add). The winner gets a $100 bar tab, or bottle of scotch, or, if you're one of those professional writer types that needs some sort of compensatory justification for wasting time writing about ghosts, a small green portrait of Benjamin Franklin.</p>
<p>Let's say that the deadline is the morning of Monday, October 27. That's a little more than a month — plenty of time to write, I think. It'll also give us all a few precious pre-Halloween days to read and vote on everyone else's work.</p>
<p>I realize the task may sound daunting — it does to me, too, at least a little bit. But I'm inspired by the example of the Salon d'Avent, which indicates to me me that you guys are capable of it. Plus I've already talked to a few folks who've said they'll come up with something.</p>
<p>Besides, it doesn't have to be a sprawling masterpiece. I've read terrifying stories that are less than 300 words. You could write a sonnet to a dead girl, or a business letter to that vampire who's been giving you trouble. Or, if you're <a class="reference external" href="http://waste.typepad.com/">Wolfson</a>, you could write in some archaic form that leaves me feeling both terrified <em>and</em> dumb. It just needs to be made of words, spooky in nature, and able to appeal to your fellow blog reader. All you have to do is start thinking of scary things for the next couple of weeks, then take half an hour or so to write them down. It's easy money!</p>
<p>To serve as inspiration (and an occasional reminder), over the course of the next month I plan to post some spooky stories that I'm personally fond of, hopefully in a variety of media. Let's start off with an easy one: a comic. Don't worry, we'll get at least somewhat more literary later on.</p>
<p>This is a nine-page standalone story from <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/B-P-R-D-Universal-Machine-Mike-Mignola/dp/1593077106/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1222269637&amp;sr=8-1">BPRD vol. 6: The Universal Machine</a> (BPRD is a Hellboy spinoff, and has become an excellent title in its own right — go <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/B-P-R-D-Universal-Machine-Mike-Mignola/dp/1593077106/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1222269637&amp;sr=8-1">buy it</a>!).</p>
<p>This little story probably took no more than two pages of script, but it's one of my favorite things from the Hellboy universe. It's wry, and short, and sad. And of course it's spooky, too. Click the graphic below to open it up as a Flickr slideshow.</p>

                    <p>Getting back from Philadelphia yesterday was not fun. I imagine it won't surprise anyone to hear that the Chinatown bus has been getting more and more crowded as people respond to higher gas prices. What <em>is</em> surprising is how badly the bus industry is dealing with it. Are they running more buses? No. Raising ticket prices? No. They seem not to have noticed that anything's different, in fact, despite everyone else managing to — yesterday there was even a young guy shooting footage and doing interviews for what I presume to be a short documentary about the situation.</p>
<p>And that situation is not good. Sommer, Jeff and I showed up around 4:30, intending to catch the 5:00 bus. The 4:30 was late, so we were in time for that, too (buses to DC only depart a few times during the day, but these two are scheduled close together). But a couple hundred other people were waiting, too. The two buses came, loaded and left for DC, but we weren't able to make it onto either. Nor were a lot of other people. And it was nerve-wracking: the crowd was pushing and people were fighting. The situation wasn't helped by new riders who seemed to feel they were entitled to physically bar others from boarding while their families and friends pushed up to the front of the crowd. Understandable, I guess, but dangerous.</p>
<p>At that point we decided we'd had enough and, after confirming that Greyhound wasn't running another bus anytime soon, we headed to the train station. Amtrak, at least, has responded to the increased demand: they've jacked up their fares. That at least makes it easier to avoid being crushed to death, but it's still hard to understand why bargain-basement rail travel costs six times as much as the bus. I mean, sure: infrastructure. Overhead. Better service. Relatively paltry public subsidies. But <em>six times</em>?</p>
<p>I hope that the bus companies begin to respond to the demand for this route soon. All the new players — Bolt, DC2NY, Megabus — run NYC/Philly and NYC/DC routes but, despite the NYC/DC bus assuredly passing through Philly to drop off passengers, they won't let you book a trip that doesn't include New York. As someone already prone to seething over New York City's collective solipsism, it's pretty infuriating to see half-empty buses leaving for the Big Apple on the half hour while people are risking serious injury jostling for a $15 seat to DC.</p>

<p>Of course, the design is also a bit impractical: got any existing tunnels or stations? Well, I hope you've got a lot of money, too, because you're going to have to rebuild them all.</p>
<p>But it strikes me (the person who knows nothing about trains) as a potentially feasible idea if implemented by simply delinking individual cars. New cars could be brought up to speed by an engine that hangs around a given city, accelerating passengers, connecting them to passing trains and then heading back to repeat the process. Disconnected cars could coast into station or be picked up by such a system. You'd have to figure out the right car to sit in based on your destination, but the upside would be to make every train an express.</p>
<p>The downside is no doubt the complexity involved in synchronizing speeds so precisely as to make such a system safe. But surely it must be possible — after all, this is a problem that's been well-addressed for <a class="reference external" href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=ALu7dxP5fao">over a hundred years</a>.</p>

                    <p>Via <a class="reference external" href="http://outtamindouttasite.typepad.com">Catherine</a> comes <a class="reference external" href="http://dc.mybikelane.com/">MyBikeLane</a>, an effort to document (with license plate annotation!) drivers' lack of respect for bicycle lanes. This is a subject dear to my heart as, during my twice-daily commute through <a class="reference external" href="http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&amp;ll=38.905428,-77.031112&amp;spn=0.004266,0.009538&amp;z=17">Thomas Circle</a>, I often keep myself bitter/amused by pondering how unimaginable it would be for a driver to be ticketed for violating the space defined by the bike lane.</p>
<p>Thomas Circle is a hotbed of bike lane atrocities. Putting such a lane on the outer edge of a traffic circle is a bad idea to begin with: you're inviting cyclists passing through the circle to cut directly in front of vehicles leaving it. Without the bike lane those cyclists would presumably join the regular flow of traffic, making them a lot more likely to be noticed by drivers.</p>
<p>But it's not just a problem of design. Drivers have no respect for the lanes, and unless they've noticed a biker in sight are all too happy to drift into them, whether from wanting to turn less sharply, a desire to pass stopped traffic or simple carelessness. Fair enough — I'd be looking for a shortcut if I was stuck on 14th at rush hour, too. But given drivers' general awfulness at noticing bikes, there really can be no middle ground: they need to stay completely out of what few lanes we've been given.</p>
<p>Perhaps most mystifyingly, a hotel located on the Southern edge of the circle has helped itself to ten feet or so of the bike lane, setting up white traffic cones in it, presumably to save themselves a spot for their valet service or something similar. Bad enough that they feel entitled to do this — but white? The color of every miscellaneous marking on the road? A color perfectly suited to blending into the gray background noise of the street? Who would make a traffic cone white?! An idiot, that's who. I don't know about anyone else, but I've already creamed one of those asinine cones, thankfully without injuring myself in the process. Next time it happens I'm taking the goddamn cone home with me.</p>

                    <p>Well, I'm sitting in Dulles airport. Rain fell for about ten minutes during the drive out here, and the consequences have been dire: not only is my flight delayed, but the jetway has somehow been damaged and a power surge left the display board frozen in a cruel &quot;ON TIME&quot; rictus.</p>
<p>In other words, it's a great time for complaining. But not about any of this, actually: I've got the internet, a nearby Five Guys, and a power outlet. My boss, JP, is sitting next to me, obsessively checking our flight status in a way that ensures I don't have to pay any attention to what's going on. And the other guy sitting next to me has now made three consecutive phone calls expressing his nearly-outraged incredulity regarding the type of solder and flux that a subordinate suggested using for a project (&quot;40/60?! Who does he think he is?&quot;). I think he's talking about plumbing, but I'd like to believe I have it within my heart to embrace soldering in all its many forms, so this background noise still counts as soothing.</p>
<p>No, I'm pretty well set-up here. This carping has to be backdated: it's about what happened on Sunday when Emily, Charles and I flew out of SFO. The security area wasn't crowded. Charles had gone through the metal detector, I think, and Emily and I were the only two people at the table to which we'd been assigned.</p>
<p>&quot;Excuse me, miss!&quot; said a busty, bustling TSA representative. &quot;I have a registered passenger here!&quot;</p>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Registered_Traveler">Registered Traveler</a> program, you might recall, is a fairly new initiative by which air passengers can pass through expedited security lines by paying a $100-ish yearly fee to one of several private firms that then run regular background checks. Those who enroll pass through faster lines, and eventually may be allowed to do things like keep their shoes on or their laptops in their bags. It's meant for frequent travelers, and we, the public, are assured that the fees will provide additional lines and personnel — there should be no effect on those who don't enroll.</p>
<p>This was not our experience. The young woman brought by the TSA employee was allowed to cut in front of us, and was then personally led through the security process like a blind baby kitten. That was irritating, but not a particularly large inconvenience — like I said, the lines weren't long. But there also wasn't much of a point to plopping that lady's patrician ass in front of us and escorting her through — it probably made her feel special, and us less so, but nobody was saved or cost any meaningful amount of time. Still, if this is the system they use during busy periods, it really <em>is</em> going to make air travel worse for everyone who doesn't pony up $100/year to gain entry into the program.</p>
<p>Now of course there's nothing wrong with charging more for better service. But I think there's at least a <em>little</em> something wrong when that service is a government-mandated barrier to travel, and more so when it's one powered by secret lists and standards about which appeal is nearly or completely impossible. It also seems like a bad idea to give richer — and therefore more influential — passengers a way out of a system that, without some sort of opposing pressure, will inevitably become more and more irritating and inhumane as bureaucrats try to save their jobs by figuring out up ways to prevent plots that no one can anticipate.</p>
<p>I suspect the registered traveler is doomed to descend into the kind of corruption that surrounds Russian cars' <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/17/world/europe/17moscow.html?_r=4&amp;ref=world&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin">flashing blue lights</a>, although probably in a somewhat less glaringly tacky fashion. It's an inherently elitist system administered by private interests that's granted the power to short-circuit an allegedly vital security system. How could anyone think this will end well?</p>

                    <p><a class="reference external" href="http://meganmcardle.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/05/false_contempt.php">Okay</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/ezraklein_archive?month=05&amp;year=2008&amp;base_name=and_ill_take_some_contempt_on">I</a> <a class="reference external" href="http://matthewyglesias.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/05/outback_strikes_back.php">agree</a>: the New York Times treating a visit to a chain restaurant like some sort of sociological safari is a pretty irritating premise for an article. And as a child of the DC suburbs whose family very, very rarely dined out, I'm not sure what kind of claim I have to this conversation. I eat a lot of arugula (it's good!), which I think probably at least partially disqualifies me.</p>
<p>But I do think we need to establish some reasonable limits on the anti-NYT populism that's currently pouring forth from the blogosphere. Because let's be honest: Outback Steakhouse is fucking disgusting. Admittedly, I've only been once. But what kind of steakhouse doesn't ask how you want your steak cooked? I honestly can't even tell you what kind of animal provided the steak I ate. It sure didn't <em>seem</em> like beef.</p>
<p>Now it's true that I'm a fan of the &quot;big greasy fried onion thing&quot; school of culinary thought. But <a class="reference external" href="http://www.redhotanblue.com/MENU.HTM">others</a> do it so much better. Add in Fosters' claim to the worst hangover:pleasing taste ratio in the beer industry, and you can see that the entire Fauxstralian concept has little to redeem it.</p>
<p>But the other chain restaurants in that article are fine. Alright, I admit to having a grudge against the Cheesecake Factory, largely on the basis of their strangely mosquelike Clarendon location (and the perpetual lines outside it) serving as a constant local reminder of the American Empire's impending collapse. And I find something a little off-putting about Olive Garden's explicitly stated promotional campaign: &quot;Come fill up on bread!&quot; But Chili's, Bertucci's, Friday's, P.F. Chang's and Applebee's are all fine (I've never eaten at a Red Lobster, but a recent Tivo subscription to &quot;Deadliest Catch&quot; is making me want to).</p>
<p>There's nothing wrong with these places' recipes, per se, other than their inability to power pretentious foodie smalltalk and their depressing implications re: our country's per capita alfredo sauce consumption. With the cost spread over millions of diners, I believe these chains are probably willing to invest seriously in coming up with dishes that are about as good as possible given the constraints of their supply chain, price range and varying levels of kitchen talent.</p>
<p>But I can understand why they have a bad reputation — and it isn't just snobbery. The difference is really just about which restaurant in the chain you visit. If you find one with a good manager, chances are you'll get decent service and decent food. If you go to one that isn't as well run — the Chili's I last visited comes to mind (it was located in some airport) — every bite will make you acutely aware of how little care went into your meal between the walk-in and your plate.</p>
<p>The power of the brand means that a bad restaurant that belongs to a franchise can stay in business much longer than a bad restaurant that belongs to a person could; which means that if you find a bad one it'll probably seem <em>particularly</em> bad. I think it's that phenomenon — our automatic capacity for mindless brand loyalty — that makes the chains seem unappealing rather than any designed aspect of the dining experiences on offer.</p>

<p>Pretty totally sweet. City Veins, are you paying attention? You can skip to 0:52 if you're strapped for time.</p>
<p>I remember one assembly in middle school that featured something similar. For reasons still unknown to me an administrator had us all come to the auditorium and then said, basically, &quot;Children, this gentleman has built a laser harp. Please listen respectfully, and DO NOT GET INTO HIS VAN.&quot;</p>
<p>Then the laser harp guy bounded out and said &quot;Hi kids! I built this laser harp! If you think about it, that proves that you can do <em>anything you set your mind to</em>. But only if you stay off drugs! Now, who wants to hear a bad MIDI sample of an electric guitar?&quot;</p>
<p>Ah, laser harp guy. You poor bastard.</p>
<p><strong>UNRELATEDLY:</strong> Am I the only one who's found every single thing he's heard about the Newseum so far to be completely grotesque? But then, I suppose I've been down on the project ever since they scrapped the initial plans to build it high enough to reach into heaven.</p>
<p>(Yesterday, when all the network anchors interviewed Petraeus there, like high priests conducting sacred rites at their newly opened temple? Pretty bad.)</p>

I keep trying to figure out a reason I believe bookstores will survive into the future, but it seems pretty clear that books will eventually be as mercilessly digitized as music, and most bookstores will close, just as most CD stores were shuttered long ago. Tell me why I'm wrong.</blockquote>
<p>I agree with Ezra, so I don't really have anything to add except the suggestion that any answer to his question that includes the phrase &quot;the way books smell&quot; or variants thereof should be immediately disqualified.</p>

Aspartame is right out, as is caffeine: &quot;the onslaught of daily stimulants leaves the body depleted of energy, unable to reach the level of vibration necessary to effectively broadcast intention to the universe.&quot; Clearly.</div>
</div>
<p>Also, the author is quick to point out that native cultures around the world use drugs as powerful spiritual aids, that our, like, Western culture just doesn't uderstand or can't accept or something. However, the drugs that people actually like to use once they've got indoor plumbing are very bad for magically turning your crude drawing of a winning lottery ticket into that above-ground pool you've been hankering for. I know, it's a drag. On the upside, you should feel free to eat all the microalgae you want.</p>
<p>Yes, this is just another moron making things up on the internet. Hell, I do it all the time. Look, here I go: &quot;Python's a dying language.&quot; There, I said it. Soon Google will pick it up and it will be officially true. This process is called epistemology, and it's the foundation of our modern society.</p>
<p>But scroll down. There are dozens of comments on the article, all of them deeply depressing. &quot;Dear Crackpot,&quot; they say, &quot;Normally I enjoy your articles where you make things up that support my unscientific worldview. But this time the made up things contradicted some aspects of my elaborate system of dietetic make-believe! Please correct this at your earliest convenience.&quot;</p>

                    <p>A question: why doesn't anyone put wind turbines on top of skyscrapers? Mythbusters just informed me that gusts at that height can reach 90 mph. Selling the produced electricity back to the grid might be problematic in a lot of places, but one imagines the energy could be used for the building's heating and cooling plant.

                    <p>Megan is pondering <a class="reference external" href="http://meganmcardle.theatlantic.com/archives/2007/10/the_perils_of_buy_local.php">an interesting question</a>. Apparently some contrarians have begun trying to convince her that the carbon cost of transporting non-local food is so high that the metabolic energy she expends by biking to work may come at a larger carbon cost than just taking a cab. That is, a distantly-grown apple takes so much energy to grow, produce and deliver that we'd be better off burning fossil fuels rather than expending human effort.</p>
<p>Two things. First, as Megan points out, gasoline has to be transported, too. Second, not too long ago <a class="reference external" href="http://www.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2007/07/22/the_localvores_dilemma/">Drake Bennet</a> pointed out some good reasons for wondering whether local food is actually environmentally friendly: it doesn't take too many trips to the farmer's market in a mostly-empty car for the tomato you just bought there to represent more energy use than the one shipped across an ocean in a massive container ship, then packed into a fully-loaded diesel semi.</p>
<p>But I'm still curious about how the energy use breaks down. Some figures arrived at via quick googling:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://bioenergy.ornl.gov/papers/misc/energy_conv.html">One gallon of gas contains 121 MJ of energy, or 28,920 kilocalories (1 dietary calorie = 1 kilocalorie)</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://auto.howstuffworks.com/question527.htm">A 175 lb bicyclist traveling at 15 mph expends about 34 calories per mile</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_Average_Fuel_Economy#Current_standards">The highest average fuel economy in US history was 26.2 mpg</a>. Depressingly, this occurred in 1987, according to Wikipedia.</li>
<li>Fight with Quicksilver's calculator functions a little and you get... let's see here... <em>*whirring noises*</em>... 1103.81 kilocalories per mile of travel by car.</li>
</ul>
<p>So bicycling is 32.4 times more efficient, in terms of pure energy use, than driving an average car (from 1987). Making energy by growing and harvesting food certainly takes a lot more energy than making it by pumping oil out of the ground and putting it through a fractionating column. But 32 times more per unit of produced energy? Well, maybe.</p>
<p>At any rate, the difference in locally- versus distantly-grown food seems unlikely to be the deciding factor. The real question is whether, carbon-wise, you should be making that bike ride at all, regardless of where your groceries began their journey. I can easily imagine a tomato requiring 32 times more energy to grow, harvest and deliver than it provides in food energy.</p>
<p>But who knows? It's all very confusing, and the concerned individual taking deliberate action to save the environment through carefully researched lifestyle changes seems to me to be embarking on such a crapshoot that they'll be very lucky if, when all is said and done, they've managed to even offset the carbon cost incurred by their EnergyStar LCD monitor's daily display of Treehugger.</p>

                    <p>In response to my last post a much-better-informed little birdy sent me a transcript of a Homeland Security Committee hearing about online Islamic extremism. It was an interesting read, and I may say something else about it later. But for now, here's the part that was most immediately striking:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">In an effort to raise its</div>

<div class="line">insurgent group held a website design contest open to anyone in the world with</div>

<div class="line">the mouse from the winner's computer.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>It's inhuman and morally outrageous, yes. But <em>man</em>, that's a pretty good idea for an online contest. If you could just tone down the evil you might really have something there.</p>

                    <p>The Post's got <a class="reference external" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/11/AR2007091102087.html">a story</a> that might be of interest to my fellow UVA alums: apparently one of the school paper's idiot cartoonists has gotten himself fired over an offensive cartoon. It took some hunting, but I managed to find the cartoon in question, which comes from a comic strip called <em>Quirksmith</em>:</p>
<p><img alt="Quirksmith Ethiopian Food Fight Cartoon" class="center" src="/static/2007/09/12/quirksmith_ethiopian_food_fight.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 133px;" /></p>
<p>As you might expect, the most notable thing about the comic is its overwhelming lack of funniness. The joke's confused in a way that's difficult to explain — rather than being smartly flipped to hilarious effect, the conceptual setup simply lolls off to the side, like the top layer slumping off of an <a class="reference external" href="http://pygmalioninablanket.blogspot.com/2007/09/all-we-do-is-cakes.html">overengineered cake</a>.</p>
<p>It's also not very offensive, I don't think (said the white, middle-class, first-world blogger). The figures have a primitive look, but not one that's easy to unequivocally define as racist (Thinking about this more, I've changed my mind — obviously implying that all Ethiopians live in primitive conditions is pretty racist; my initial scan was for physical caricature, which isn't present. But the Post article quotes the aggrieved parties as complaining about the famine-related sentiment rather than the pictoral representation, so I think it's safe to press onward regardless...). Maybe I'm being overly and/or insufficiently generous, but I doubt the cartoonist is even aware that there's currently a famine (or near-famine) occurring in Ethiopia.</p>
<p>The Post article points out that the guy is 22 years old — that's close enough to my age that I bet he heard the same Ethiopia-targeting &quot;yo mama so skinny&quot;-style jokes that I did in elementary school. In this case Ethiopia is just being lazily used as a stand-in for the tragically un-pluralizable Nicole Richie.</p>
<p>But he must have arrived on the tail-end of this lame playground schtick, or perhaps heard it from an older sibling. So it's not entirely surprising that various similarly-aged student groups would see the strip as a mean-spirited non sequitur rather than merely a lame riff on a decades-old joke. Still, calling for the author's head over this is strikes me as playing into the hands of the David Horowitzes of the world.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I think the strip has been somewhat comedically redeemed by the controversy, if only because the Post writeup includes the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Robert Mankoff, cartoon editor for the New Yorker, which specializes in drawings that mock human foibles, looked at Woolard's cartoon after a reporter e-mailed it to him.</div>
<div class="line">...</div>
<div class="line">&quot;The New Yorker magazine would not have published it,&quot; Mankoff said.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Surprising, I know. You'd think it would be a shoo-in, given that it's both a) so inscrutable as to imply non-existent depth and b) not at all funny. Unfortunately it contains no French puns, so the magazine had to politely decline the submission.</p>
<p>Of course, none of the preceding should be taken as a defense of the <em>Quirksmith</em> author. Like nearly all Cav Daily cartoonists, he deserves the worst that the universe can come up with. This isn't the first time he's fed indefensible red meat to ideologues, either; apparently the following cartoon actually made it onto <em>The O'Reilly Factor</em>:</p>
<p><img alt="another stupid quirksmith cartoon" class="center" src="/static/2007/09/12/quirksmith060824.png" style="width: 500px; height: 165px;" /></p>
<p>Ugh.</p>
<p>I shouldn't end on a down note, though. I can't compete with Jon, who tells me that nearly-perfect <a class="reference external" href="http://pbfcomics.com">Perry Bible Fellowship</a> ran in the paper at Syracuse while he was in school. But the Cavalier Daily did have one or two good comics while I was an undergrad. My favorite was <em>Shallow Grave</em>, a bitterly funny strip drawn by a guy named <a class="reference external" href="http://polyn.com">Sean Polyn</a>, who happened to work in the same lab where I spent some time.</p>
<p>Sean's too busy being a neuroscientist to draw strips these days, but he's still got a <a class="reference external" href="http://polyn.com/strips.html">bunch of em online</a>. Here are a few of my favorites:</p>

<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.movering.com/yogaball">Yogaball is sweeping the nation</a>, and all that you can hope to do is familiarize yourself with its rules before a rising tide of family fun sweeps over the carpeted floors of your home and you just stare — and then it's like the time between now and that first spreading sheet of water never existed, and suddenly you're crying/gasping for breath in a small pocket of air near the ceiling, an indifferent flashlight bobbing next to you, and you can hear yourself and the splashing water but otherwise it's silent. THAT'S how fun Yogaball is. Prepare yourself, and consider purchasing flood and/or lawn sport insurance (if available/extant).</li>
<li>Have you ever wondered what Sommer's favorite food is? Of course you have. Well, stop torturing yourself about it. This and other revelations can be found in <a class="reference external" href="http://www.washingtonian.com/blogarticles/people/capitalcomment/4989.html">her interview with Washingtonian</a>, which she handled with grace and wit.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://pygmalioninablanket.blogspot.com/2007/08/something-meaty-this-way-comes-part-2.html">This</a> is what Western civilization has been working toward all these years.

<li><a class="reference external" href="http://torrentfreak.com/comcast-wrongfully-denies-interfering-with-bittorrent/">Comcast claims they aren't interfering with BitTorrent despite strong evidence to the contrary</a>. The problem apparently isn't affecting all Comcast users, and TorrentFreak says that some BT client authors are integrating workarounds into their programs. So if you're a Comcast customer perhaps you don't need to panic after all.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=13829386">Frank Deford on pro wrestling's high mortality rate</a>. It's nice to see a real sports journalist talk about wrestling and its occasionally tragic aspects without sneering. But Deford's stretching things when he tries to connect the deaths directly to steroid abuse in other sports. Yes, wrestlers' anabolically-enhanced bulk contributes to a lot of premature heart attacks. But that's just part of the story — there's also abuse of other substances among wrestlers, particularly opiates. The industry involves a lot of travel and an economic structure that encourages wrestlers to continue to work while injured. As a result a staggering number of wrestlers get addicted to painkillers at one point or another, and often other drugs as well. The lifestyle is basically that of a chemically supercharged carny. Steroid use certainly isn't healthy, but I don't think it completely explains why the wrestling industry produces so many dead men in hotel rooms.</li>

                    <p>I haven't started reading <em>Deathly Hallows</em> yet, although Emily and I did break down and sheepishly buy a copy from the customer service desk at Giant last night. She's most of the way through, but is currently taking a break. I've been rereading a borrowed copy of the sixth book (thanks <a class="reference external" href="http://ficke.typepad.com">Matt</a>!), reminding myself of important contextual points like who the hell Romilda Vane is and how to pluralize &quot;horcrux&quot;.</p>
<p>I've also found myself reading a lot of blog posts about whether Harry Potter is good or stupid or could beat up my dad. Most of these are merely the forces of curmudgeonliness checking in for another round of the fight that <a class="reference external" href="http://secretplans.org/Journal/74/michael-chabon-on-short-stories">Michael Chabon started</a> (it's both a children's book and a wild commercial success, so they like their odds).</p>
<p>There's also the willfully counterintuitive posts — folks who decide not to let the books charm them, then write 300 words about how they don't see what the big deal is. My favorite so far is <a class="reference external" href="http://commentisfree.guardian.co.uk/megan_mcardle/2007/07/harry_potter_the_economics.html">Megan McArdle's economic critique of Harry Potter</a>, the subhead of which contains the hilarious assertion that &quot;successful magical worlds depend on basic economic principles&quot;.</p>
<p>It's tempting to quibble with Megan's complaints about the apparent limitlessness of magic, dismay at the authorial sloppiness implied by a reliance on imperfect communication between characters, and puzzlement over how stratification of wealth can exist in a society blessed with extraordinary abundance. But plausible answers to these criticisms can be found in the AD&amp;D rule book (any edition), <a class="reference external" href="http://www.auburn.edu/~vestmon/Gift_of_the_Magi.html">O Henry's short stories</a> and contemporary American society, respectively. So I won't belabor the point.</p>
<p>I do think it's interesting to consider the books' appeal, though. Kriston provides a nice account of it <a class="reference external" href="http://www.campusprogress.org/soundvision/1732/in-defense-of-harry">here</a>. But I think my own reasons come closer to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.unfogged.com/archives/week_2007_07_15.html#007203">Ogged's</a>: these books are hugely comforting. The reliable patterns of discovery, worry-prefaced resolution and compassionate authority figures are incredibly soothing. Plus there's the handily straightforward good/evil dynamic, which makes even the tension reassuring in a Rocky IV-ish sort of way. More than anything, there's a pervasive sense that everything will work out in the end. Or there is for me, anyway — perhaps those who've already finished the new book will disagree.</p>

I guess I'm probably behind on all of this, but I found it interesting and, as someone who's at least had offsets purchased on their behalf, personally relevant. The upshot seems to be that you can't just buy $1 worth of carbon non-release. Your money's actually pushing the margins of where it makes sense for companies to implement clean technologies — projects that they were considering doing for reasons unrelated to climate change. It's not clear whether traders are doing a good job of actually getting the money where it can best tip those scales, though, or whether it's just a case of a smattering of environmentally beneficial projects having their profit margins inflated at random. It's also unclear how much of the transaction the brokers are pocketing.</p>

Details seem a bit scarce, but odds are that they'll just be throwing the Sprint logo into the ID3v2 metadata sections of the tracks (or whatever the equivalent is for AAC). It's an interesting idea, but I have a hard time imagining it's a strategy that would be worth pursuing if not for the one-time earned media that its inventiveness is garnering.</p>

The first such party just featured Dr. Pepper (the groom was Mormon, though, so this was pretty transgressive at the time).</p>

Fortunately, my friends at the IMF are uneasy with his story — and, of course, deeply concerned that the sum in question gets to the person who truly deserves it. So they're trying to get in touch with me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We want to hear from you before we can make the transfer to confirm if you are dead or not.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
RE: OUTSTANDING PAYMENT.
Good day, Your Long overdue Payment. I saw your name (in the Central Computer among the list of unpaid contractors,inheritance next of kin and lotto beneficiaries that was originated from Africa, Europe,
Asia Plus Middle east, Americans ) among the list of individuals and companies that your unpaid fund has been located to the Standard Chartered Bank, HSBC,Barclays Bank, Natwest  Bank Uk,and Bank o f America.
Your name appeared among the beneficiaries who will receive a part-payment of $10 million and has been approved already for months. You are requested to get back to me for more direction and instruction on how to receive your fund. However, we received an email from one Mr. Robert Water who told us that he is your next of kin and that you died in a car accident last
week.

                    <p>Ezra <a class="reference external" href="http://ezraklein.typepad.com/blog/2007/06/faith.html">wonders</a> why one religion can be considered more worthy of belief than another, using Christianity and the Flying Spaghetti Monster as examples:</p>
<blockquote>
The flying spaghetti monster and what-have-you are clearly not belief systems with the demonstrated resiliency or applicability of Christianity, but my crude understanding of the way faith works in all this doesn't provide much illumination as to why [Christianity and other mainstream religions] are more worthy of faith, as opposed to a sort of for-the-good-of-society adherence.</blockquote>
<p>But the answer is pretty simple, isn't it? The Flying Spaghetti Monster is designed to be an enormous &quot;fuck you&quot; to people of faith. It's pretty funny, but an idea grounded in that sort of aggressively negative impulse is obviously unworthy of genuine respect.</p>
<p>Other religions were designed for more genuine reasons, and those reasons matter to people. The extent to which a belief system appears to be genuinely concerned in helping its followers — that's important. I think this can be hard for devout atheists to see, because they tend to believe that all organized religions amount to systems of enslavement and oppression (whether or not they were intentionally designed to be) — religions' practical badness may vary, but they're all theoretically distasteful in the same way. I think that's a perfectly coherent way of looking at things, but it does assume that the observer is less naive than a large chunk of the earth's population. That's not necessarily an untenable position to be in — but while you're there, you should do your best to not be an ass about it. That means no <a class="reference external" href="http://www.subgenius.com/">ironic religions</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://evolvefish.com/">Darwin fish</a> or <a class="reference external" href="http://www.slate.com/id/2135499/">zealous anti-evangelism evangelism</a>.</p>
<p>Reducing all religions to one undifferentiated mass of irrationality is a bit hubristic. I think it's not unreasonable to say that if a tradition has meant a lot to a lot of people and isn't a completely transparent scam (e.g. Scientology), then it deserves to be accorded more deference than religious thought-experiments like the FSM. It's just a matter of showing respect for your fellow human beings, some of whom probably even deserve it. A tiny sliver of benefit-of-the-doubt isn't too much to ask.</p>

                    <p>Via <a class="reference external" href="http://www.unfogged.com/archives/week_2007_06_03.html#006919">Unfogged</a> via <a class="reference external" href="http://highclearing.com/index.php/archives/2007/06/04/6562">Jim Henley</a> comes an extremely interesting feature in New York Magazine about <a class="reference external" href="http://nymag.com/news/features/2007/profit/">how NYC businesses make their money</a>. You can see the markup on fish at Nobu, how dollar stores stay in business and how to get into the fast-paced and exciting crystal meth industry.</p>
<p>But <a class="reference external" href="http://nymag.com/news/features/2007/profit/32900/">this</a> is the most arresting of the slides. You know, I've been reading <a class="reference external" href="http://pipeline.corante.com/">Derek Lowe's excellent blog</a> for a while now — he's a chemist working in the pharmaceutical industry, and provides fascinating looks at how the industry works on a regular basis. Unsurprisingly, he's more sympathetic to the drug companies than the average American. And he does a good job of convincing readers that these corporations aren't the merciless profit engines that we all imagine them to be. He's got me at least partially convinced — I stand ready with Lowe-penned rebuttals to arguments about universities doing all the drug discovery work, and a sense of pity for those poor executives who are stuck with astoundingly large bills for clinical trials. What else can they do, though, but stalwartly defend the public's health?</p>
<p>But the NY Magazine graphic undercuts all that. Everyone knows that drug companies spend huge amounts of money on marketing. I hadn't realized that the amount dwarfs the cost of trials, though.</p>
<p>And, having just read <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/03/health/03docs.html?_r=1&amp;oref=login">Sunday's article</a> about doctors continuing to receive payments for research, speaking and trials even after public disgraces, I'm left even less sympathetic. Lowe <a class="reference external" href="http://pipeline.corante.com/archives/2007/06/03/pecunia_non_olet.php">blogged about it</a> and also didn't come away happy. I agree with him that it's unlikely that drug companies are selecting <em>for</em> incompetent doctors. But the fact that they're paying even the bad ones implies that a large proportion of that &quot;marketing and sales&quot; budget goes to shoveling money at every doctor in sight. Presumably this is done to generally shift prescribing habits toward particular companies' medications — or at least to avoid falling out of favor when some other company's busty new sales rep comes by with promotional scrip pads and promises of golf junkets.</p>
<p>After all, that immense promotional budget couldn't <em>all</em> go toward commercials of newly-continent men toasting each other with water, could it? The evening news/<em>Wheel of Fortune</em> block simply doesn't have that much ad inventory.</p>
<p>I wonder whether this is the sort of thing that universal health care is supposed to solve. Maybe my wiser friends can clue me in. I can imagine a plan with a formulary making these sorts of payouts pointless. But it seems like it'd have to be a pretty strict formulary — probably stricter than would be medically wise.</p>
<p>Anyway, I'm not entirely sure why I'm blogging this. My best guess is that Ezra emits some sort of electromagnetic field that makes people interested in healthcare. I'm sure it'll wear off soon.</p>

                    <p>Tonight we play miniature golf. This has been on the beach-agenda every year, but this year's staying-the-whole-week innovation makes it look like it's finally going to happen. I'm pretty excited; I consider mini-golf to be an important part of the beach experience.</p>

<p><em>Dinosaur or Pirate Ship?</em></p>

<p>Keep saying it until it's almost a zen koan. Dinosaur or Pirate Ship? There may not be an answer, but this does not excuse you from seeking one.</p>

Misuse of a/an is a pet peeve of mine — when I come across &quot;an university&quot; or a similar formulation I immediately know that what I'm reading is going to become terrible, if it isn't already. It's a great tip-off that the author hasn't made a connection between writing and speaking, and that spells trouble — a stream of &quot;whilst&quot;s is rarely far behind.</p>
<p>On the other end of the spectrum, of course, is <a class="reference external" href="http://www.matthewyglesias.com">Yglesias</a>'s neverending cavalcade of homophones — a case where speaking and writing are so tightly connected that all kinds of amusing minor typos result (see also: my constant overuse of colons, semicolons, emdashes and commas). I suppose you can err too far in either direction, but Matt's is by far the more readable option.</p>
<p>Of course, none of this explains the dismayingly frequent &quot;an historic&quot; formulation. I can't account for that one at all, except to say that I think our species is probably doomed.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>Look, I know that everybody's <a class="reference external" href="http://news.independent.co.uk/environment/wildlife/article2449968.ece">very concerned</a> about the disappearing honeybees. For the record, I am pro-bee: I enjoy consuming their sugary vomit both on toast and in tea. And out of all the invertebrates I think they run the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ilovebees.com/">best alternate reality games</a>.</p>
<p>But the last couple of weeks have seen a ridiculously large portion of the internet devoted to concern about them. It's difficult to find a comment thread that doesn't have someone chiming in about the fucking bees. &quot;This is somewhat OT,&quot; they'll say, &quot;But have you heard about how cell phones are killing bees? I'm just as concerned about [Bush administration malfeasance / a blogger code of conduct / Sanjaya getting voted off Idol] as anyone else, but if we lose the bees we'll have bigger things to worry about.&quot;</p>
<p>This is frequently accompanied by a quote from Albert Einstein that, in an oddly contemporary, half-colloquial formulation, opines about the agricultural importance of honeybees, despite Einstein seemingly possessing no particular expertise about either subject (at least when the bees in question are traveling at less than the speed of light). I'm skeptical of this quotation's provenance, but I do kind of like the idea of attributing random boosterism to history's great thinkers. For instance, did you know that Rene Descartes is frequently credited with coining the phrase &quot;Reduce, Reuse and Recycle&quot;? Or that John Donne was fond of composing epigrams pointing readers to the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.climatecrisis.net/takeaction/carboncalculator/">climatecrisis.net carbon calculator</a>? It's true! I'm pretty sure I read it on Wikipedia the other day.</p>
<p>Well, relax. According to a marginally-more-reputable source, the bees are probably going to be fine. As we drove to Stanford, Emily and I heard a full hour-long show on NPR about the disappearing insects. I can't find a URL for the show — this was the Bay area, so I guess it's probably only available on the goddamn WELL — but trust me: it was authoritative-sounding.</p>
<p>The roundtable discussion featured an entomologist whose lab was conducting the largest nationwide survey of colony collapse disorder, another entomologist who he seemed to not like very much, and a guy who'd written a book about California bees and, I think, lived among them and learned their ways. A parade of well-meaning San Franciscan hybrid owners called in with every possible bee-killing grievance that you, I and the rest of the internet could think of — electromagnetic radiation, GM crops, pesticides, the war in Iraq — and the bee experts methodically shot down each one. &quot;Yes, it's disconcerting,&quot; they'd say, &quot;But it's happened in the past, long before this particular [chemical / technology / front in the global war on terror] existed.&quot; They also said that there's no apparent correlation between affected colonies' proximity to developed areas, and that even bees that operate solely on organic crops have been afflicted. When the bees leave their colonies they abandon the site in a hurry — other animals avoid it for a while, too, even if there's still honey present. The experts seemed to feel that a fungus, parasite or other natural pest was probably to blame. It's happened before and the bees have recovered.</p>
<p>So let's all calm down. The most pressing bee-related problem of this spring has been and continues to be how to get rid of the threatening, probably-Africanized ones that seem to be setting up shop at the far end of my porch. Yet on this subject, the Kos diarists have remained strangely silent. Priorities, people.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Prompted by arguing the point in comments over at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.unfogged.com/archives/week_2007_04_22.html#006670">Unfogged</a>, I managed to track down the program in question. It's from the imaginatively-named &quot;Forum&quot; on KQED. The show's archive page is <a class="reference external" href="http://www.kqed.org/epArchive/R703090900">here</a>.

<p>This graffiti may not seem very remarkable. But in a town where every other beer comes in a pint glass with an Eagles logo on it, and any group of three or more adults can be counted on to eventually disrupt the parade/checkout line/funeral they're attending with a chant of &quot;E-A-G-L-E-S EAGLES!!!&quot;, it's kind of noteworthy.</p>
<p>Also, note the stray mark between the N and S in &quot;Redskins&quot;. That's presumably the point at which the artist was dragged away from the wall and beaten to death.</p>

                    <p>I'm sitting on the couch, watching Tivoed episodes of <a class="reference external" href="http://travel.discovery.com/fansites/bourdain/bourdain-season3.html">Tony Bourdain's fantastic travel show</a>, sipping coffee and settling in for a day of <a class="reference external" href="/2007/03/14/similarity-matrix-2/">coding-for-fun</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://asap.washingtonpost.com/tourneytracker/bracket.html?FxeL">basketball-watching</a> (I got off to an okay start, but I know I'm doomed).

<p>Naturally enough, I'm psyching myself up for all of this by reading some old material on the internet about professional wrestling. What could be more logical? I used to know an awful lot about it, considering myself a &quot;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.doubletongued.org/index.php/dictionary/smark/">smart mark</a>&quot;. I even went to the theater to watch <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyond_the_Mat">Jake The Snake Roberts smoke crack on film</a>. I don't really keep up with it anymore, but it's relaxing and familiar, and that makes it just right for this morning's pre-caffeinated period.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>There was a lot of good swag at SXSW, most of it in the form of promotional trinkets that a self-describedly net savvy individual such as myself will proudly add to the constellation of brands that define his persona, despite their uncaring and inhuman nature (they would take our blood if it could be used to cool CPUs). In fact, I'm wearing a <a class="reference external" href="http://pipes.yahoo.com">Yahoo Pipes</a> t-shirt right now. Capitalism works!</p>
<p>I didn't realize it at the time, but the best or at least most interesting swag came in the tote bag that every attendee received. For one thing, there was the pin from <a class="reference external" href="http://www.makezine.com">MAKE Magazine</a> that I cherish but have already almost managed to destroy. But this curiousity was even more striking:</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/421764736/"><img alt="a picture of a packet of nicogel hand gel. smokers are supposed to rub it into their hands to alleviate cravings." class="center" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/183/421764736_2be07ae9d0.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>I didn't have the guts to try it, but <a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/people/blturner/">Ben</a> did. &quot;My hands feel <em>great</em>,&quot; he said, after an initial period of wondering whether it would do anything. &quot;They're all cool and relaxed.&quot; Presumably this was menthol Nicogel.</p>
<p>I'd try it, but I'm too chicken — I feel like I use my hands an awful lot. So I've given it to Charles, who seems to be in the Nicogel's target market. Hopefully he'll give it a shot and report back.</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/421773474/"><img alt="an issue of Wizard Magazine" class="right" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/129/421773474_5a7e313145_m.jpg" /></a>Even better, though, was the unassuming inclusion of a copy of Wizard, which was one of many magazines in the packet (Linux Journal is really good!). Any other nerds reading this will probably be familiar with Wizard. During our childhood it served primarily as a price guide for comics, reporting made-up numbers that were supposed to chart a complex economy defined by two whole companies and a million parents' basements. It always sounded like an interesting thing to read, and sort of was — until you realized that reading actual comic books was way more fun than reading meta comic books.</p>
<p>Nowadays it's a bit glossier and more accessible. In this issue, at least, there are a lot of two-page spreads devoted to essays on things like &quot;What's in store for the X-Men in 2007?&quot; They get quotes from comic writers and artists, and everyone talks about the characters as if they were real people (just like in Soap Opera Digest, if the covers are any indication). It certainly helped me figure out some of the gibberish that Kriston and Matt have been spouting the last few months. I may even make the effort and <a class="reference external" href="http://isohunt.com/download/16530435/punisher+war+journal+3">catch</a> <a class="reference external" href="http://jomic.sourceforge.net/">up</a> with this whole &quot;Civil War&quot; storyline.</p>
<p>But Wizard is no longer just about comics. They've also branched out into the wider geek world. And although they're not the greatest interviewers in the world, the writers proceed with an entertaining lack of pretension. Let's be honest: nobody gives a fuck what a producer from Lost thinks about mythological archetypes. They just want to know who the Others are, and when Kate and Sawyer are going to do it. Wizard is sensitive to this fact. Every question in every interview could be rewritten as, &quot;No, seriously, give us some spoilers.&quot; It's great.</p>
<p>And in this issue there is, in fact, an interview about Lost. It's with David Lindelof, one of the show's creators. You can find it <a class="reference external" href="http://www.wizarduniverse.com/television/lost/002870368.cfm?page=1">here</a>, and it's wonderful. Not because it contains any satisfying revelations about the plot — it doesn't reveal anything. But at the very end it officially releases Lost dead-enders like myself from the show's infuriating grip:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><strong>Youâ€™ve said that there is a sort of five-season plan in place for &quot;Lost.&quot; Are you guys still on track for that plan?</strong></div>
<div class="line">Did I say that?</div>
<div class="line"><strong>I think you said it...</strong></div>
<div class="line">I think thatâ€™s one of those things that has been attributed to me that no one has actually said. There have been sort of vague questions as to how much story we have or what the plan is, and I think that the only thing that Iâ€™ve ever said on the record is that if we were in a position to actually end the show on our own terms, that it would probably be at the end of four years. That would be the ultimate nexus point for the show. But unfortunately, itâ€™s completely moot whether itâ€™s four years or five years or seven years, because I donâ€™t own the show and [co-creator and executive producer] J.J. [Abrams] doesnâ€™t own the show and [executive producer] Carlton [Cuse] doesnâ€™t own the show - Touchstone and ABC own the show. And as long as itâ€™s a show that is popular and that people are watching, theyâ€™ll never let us end it, which is sad and depressing.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>There you have it: confirmation of the show's inevitable X-Filesification. The only thing you can do is stop watching, then swoop back in when its cancellation has been announced. Thank you, Wizard.</p>
<p>And thank you for tricking Emily into reading you. Guys, how many times have you been asked to analogize Marvel vs. DC to Playstation vs. Xbox? I don't even think she was asking it sarcastically. Not entirely, anyway.</p>

                    <p>Saturday night was astoundingly great. Earlier in the week Josh asked me if I might like to dress up like a superhero and stand around an Arlington TV studio for a few hours. Clearly the answer was yes.</p>
<p>So two nights ago Emily and I joined Josh and Lindsay at Galaxy Hut before heading a few doors down to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.arlingtonmedia.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=12&amp;Itemid=257">channel 69</a> to be extras in the next episode of <a class="reference external" href="http://channel102.net/show.php?show=88">Defenders of Stan</a>.</p>
<p>Getting a bunch of people dressed up like superheroes is an excellent way to start an evening. And Arlington's small-world tendencies made the evening even better: <a class="reference external" href="http://dcist.com/staff.php#hemal">Hemal</a> and her sister Payal were there, and I was pleasantly surprised to see <a class="reference external" href="http://www.thelegwarmers.com/jr.asp">HT</a> in a jaunty cape — I've known the guy off and on since taking computer classes at the Career Center together, where he and I acquired the advanced Applesoft BASIC skills that eventually led him to work with my friend <a class="reference external" href="http://www.mp3.com/users/Jon47/profile.php">Jon</a>. Like I said, Arlington's a small world. A small, inbred world.</p>
<p>The shoot was pretty fun, particularly since Josh made an in-costume run to Whole Foods for beer. After things wrapped up we tried to head back to Galaxy Hut, but they looked a little crowded and were charging a cover. So Josh continued his streak of real-life heroism and drove us all into the city to meet up with folks at Townhouse. I stopped taking photos at that point; Kriston's photostream <a class="reference external" href="http://flickr.com/photos/cappseus/395804032/">picks up</a> the <a class="reference external" href="http://flickr.com/photos/cappseus/395803956/">story</a> from there.</p>
<p>But here are the shots I did get:</p>

                    <p>Well, I'm back. The retreat was fun, and surprisingly useful. I'm more hostile than most when it comes to what I call team-ology — the sort of unscientific time-wasters that arise when someone takes an ex-CEO's platitudes about proactivity (or whatever else) a little too seriously. A surprisingly large number of people can be convinced that a set of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.successories.com/index.cfm/fuseaction/dir_product.brand_title_sku/product_group_id/e429709c-250d-488d-a7bb-90f537107324/brand_id/e1624976-0a99-4882-a357-9fa2471c0b4b/product_title_id/f045815b-2367-4b4a-86fd-70bd3f8012b2/product_id/6818c9b9-d30d-4419-bb21-43bcafec1d9d/page_number/1/page_sort/name/product_theme_id/e5c78b41-e1d4-4e31-9b7b-736baa0eb698/Above-Beyond.cfm">successories-style</a> cliches nested in a simply-made-up dependency tree counts as a theory of something. Ropes courses and trust falls are infinitely more useful than that sort of bullshit.</p>
<p>Fortunately there was surprisingly little of that stuff on the ED retreat. Most of the exercises we did were useful or led to useful conversations. Still, for sheer team-building efficacy nothing can compete with drinking beer and playing DDR:</p>
<p>We had almost no internet access at the site, so I've been out of touch. That's led to me being a bad blogger, contenting myself over the weekend with adding useless <a class="reference external" href="http://kailashnadh.name/ducksoup/">Technorati widgets</a> and archives to this site instead of content. I can't say that the trend of pointless but technically interesting effort is going to end anytime soon — here's a teaser for the latest <a class="reference external" href="/2006/12/08/be-your-own-aronofsky/">useless thing</a> that I'm trying to do with video:</p>
<p><img alt="ascii art" class="center" src="/static/2007/01/16/_20thcenturyascii.jpg" style="width: 439px; height: 283px;" /></p>
<p>But I realize that I've been putting my few long-suffering readers through a lot of technical mumbo jumbo lately. I promise I'll try to reengage the non-robotic part of my brain sometime soon.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Here's <a class="reference external" href="http://blogs.nbcuni.com/DwightsBlog/2006/11/how_to_work_well_with_others.php">a workplace philosophy</a> that I wholeheartedly endorse (see final paragraph).</p>

<p>I suppose that this verbal use of &quot;gift&quot; isn't technically incorrect — that's what the internet tells me, anyway. But it still seems really, really ugly to me. I've given up on the rest of the American-speaking world, but I expect more from my turtleneck-wearing yuppie compatriots in Cupertino. They really ought to task some more people with editing. So to speak.</p>

<div class="line">As far as I can recall, there is no candy bar on the national market that contains raisins. None of even moderate prominence, anyway. The closest you can come is Nestle's generally-underrated <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cybercandy.co.uk/search/index1.php/url_indprod/xdbc_2">Chunky</a> product, but its length:(width+height) ratio is all off — it's some sort of ill-conceived candy chimera.

<div class="line">Now, I'm not noting this to argue for raisins as a primary candy bar component — I know that proposition would be controversial. Still, you have to admit that raisins are a classic confection ingredient; a solid, dependable utility player. Yet the candy bar industry systematically ignores them. Meanwhile, various other ingredients — the poorly-defined &quot;nougat&quot; in particular — seem to me to be consistently over-represented. I don't know exactly what's going on, but it's virtually guaranteed to be sinister.</div>

<div class="line">First, my blogging performance. Work is taking nearly every waking moment, and will continue to do so through Monday. It stinks.</div>
<div class="line">Second: Glenn Beck, as noted by Mike Boyer via <a class="reference external" href="http://cyrusfarivar.com/blog/?p=1185">Cyrus</a>. I happened to catch Beck's exchange with representative-elect Keith Ellison while I was at the gym the other day, and it was pretty disgusting. As quoted by Boyer, here's how Beck started off the interview with Ellison, who is our country's first Muslim congressman:</div>
</div>
<blockquote>
OK. No offense, and I know Muslims. I like Muslims. I've been to mosques. I really don't believe that Islam is a religion of evil.... With that being said, you are a Democrat ... what I feel like saying is, 'Sir, prove to me that you are not working with our enemies.' And I know you're not. I'm not accusing you of being an enemy, but that's the way I feel, and I think a lot of Americans will feel that way.</blockquote>
<p>If my memory's right, Boyer's ellipses are a little unfair. Beck prefaced his comments by pointing out that Ellison favors a &quot;cut and run&quot; strategy in Iraq. So this ridiculousness was at least in part motivated by Ellison daring to have opinions about foreign policy that differ from those of a learned cable news anchor — it wasn't <em>entirely</em> about Ellison's religion. Still, there's no denying that Beck was saying to a democratically-elected representative: <em>the burden of proof is upon you to prove that you're not a traitor. Go!</em> It was kind of astounding.</p>

That weekend remains undocumented, although I do have a blockbuster post about brains in jars planned (it was a good weekend).</p>
<p>This weekend it was Kriston and Kate's turn, and we had a grand ol' time, with lots drinking, eating, a competitive pie-off, and a visit to the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.phillyjazz.org/bobbarb.html">Pabstiest Place On Earth</a> (with special guests The Oldest Jazz Band Ever). It was great.</p>
<p>The weekend also featured the completion of a Philadelphian obligation that I had somehow, until now, escaped: cheesesteaks. Kate was attending the Mütter Museum with a friend, but on Saturday Emily, Kriston and I wended our way through the Italian market and on to the center of cheesesteak culture in Philadelphia (and therefore the universe).</p>
<p>Pat's and Geno's Steaks sit across the street from one another, and are by far the most famous purveyors of gristle and cheese in the city. Native Philadelphians don't seem to like to admit loyalty to either — doing so would betray a lack of nuance, revealing the speaker as an unserious person who hadn't considered the science and philosophy of cheesesteaks in a careful and dispassionate way. Needless to say, this quest for knowledge is deeply personal — tourists are not invited — so instead of giving you a straight answer they'll generally just pick a family member's name at random and pretend that it's an actual steak-purveyor (&quot;Yeah, those places are okay, but you've really got to have a steak from Uncle Joe's&quot;).</p>
<p>But Pat's and Geno's were the obvious entry points for cheesesteak philistines like ourselves. Besides, they were nearby. So that's where we headed.</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://flickr.com/photos/lhoon/150998789/"><img alt="photo of Pat's Steaks by Flickr user LHOON" src="/static/2006/11/12/20061112_pats.jpg" /></a>The two businesses look very different. Geno's is a neon abomination: whored out in orange and sporting a co-branded Harley dealership, it's an obvious affront to the Heavens, challenging God to strike down earthly, steak-begotten pride. Pat's is considerably more sedate, offering amiable signage and little other decoration. It looks like the type of place you'd imagine Texan high school football players take their girlfriends immediately before accidentally knocking them up.</p>
<p>But the differences aren't just superficial; there's also the question of politics. It's hard to miss the giant placards outside Geno's that memorialize Officer Daniel Faulkner, who, the reader is helpfully informed, was &quot;murdered by Mumia Abu-jamal&quot; in 1981. Of course, vehement opposition to a cause celebre of the far left isn't proof of anything — but it isn't a very good sign. More conclusive: the notices by the order window aggressively asserting that patrons must order in English because this is America (dammit), and that failure to do so may result in service being refused. There's even a newspaper clipping with a photo of the owner proudly pointing at the sign, as if to say, &quot;Hey, check out what an enormous asshole I am! I think it's <em>great</em>.&quot; Needless to say, we avoided Geno's.</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://flickr.com/photos/gregscher/181969149/"><img alt="photo of Geno's rightwing signs by by Flickr user greg s." src="/static/2006/11/12/20061112_speakenglish.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Admittedly, Pat's is not as expressly ideological; I have no proof that their politics are more in keeping with my own than Geno's. However, buying a steak at Pat's involves spending so much time standing in line — and in so many <em>different</em> lines — that I feel comfortable identifying the management as fellow travelers (Geno's has multiple lines, too, but they have more of an airport security screening/All-American feel to them).</p>
<p>After a slow but successful Saturday experience at Pat's I had expected to be able to avoid Geno's permanently and entirely. But Kriston and Kate wanted to get a last-minute steak as we headed out of town, and the line at Pat's was imposing. We put on our best Walmart-shopper faces and headed to Geno's, where we promptly acquired sandwiches and tried to find a seat that hadn't been covered by the depressing sick that had been falling from the sky all day.</p>
<p>We were only fifty yards from Pat's, but it felt much, much father than that. The line had expanded while we placed our orders, filled out by Eagles fans coming for a post-game snack. The Eagles had just decimated the Redskins, but these fans didn't look happy. Maybe they were still smarting from Senator Santorum's recent defeat; maybe Clinton Portis' broken hand hadn't satisfied their bloodlust. Whatever it was, their eyes uniformly shone with obliviousness, anger, or a combination of the two. It suddenly seemed very cold, and we ate in silence, resisting the urge to compare the meal to Pat's and thereby alert the mob to the presence of outsiders. I remember thinking: <em>this is how Anne Frank must have felt when she ate cheesesteaks.</em></p>
<p>We finished, climbed in the car and escaped into the rain-soaked evening. So, the verdict? Well, Pat's had better bread, and their battered, Burger King-style fries were — although objectively unremarkable — superior to Geno's completely uninspired frites. But the most obvious difference was the sandwich: Pat's chopped the steak, resulting in a gooey mass that seemed more like a confused cheeseburger than a sandwich in its own right. Geno's kept the steak whole, which initially inspired confidence but ultimately backfired due to my having a more precise awareness of exactly what I was eating.</p>
<p>If I had to choose I guess I'd cast my lot with Pat's, even before considering the political dimension. But mostly I have to vote for c), None of the above. The sandwich at Geno's reminded me that I used to eat cheesesteaks all the time: they fed them to us with regularity in Arlington public schools. And they were fucking <em>gross</em>. The meals I had at Geno's and Pat's weren't much different from those awful school lunches — except each cost $11 instead of $1.35. Next time I'll stick with the jumbo sliceria at the market's north end.</p>

<div class="line">Atrios <a class="reference external" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/bRuz/~3/47154871/2006_11_05_atrios_archive.html">notes</a> that Tradesports completely failed to predict the outcome in the senate. In some ways, it's unfair to use control of the senate to criticize the idea of non-financial futures markets. In this case, we're talking about a very small range of possible outcomes and a situation that was genuinely hard to predict. All Tradesports said was that the Republicans were 70% likely to retain control. That probability has to collapse into reality at some point, and 30% is nothing to sneeze at. It just didn't work out this time.</div>
<div class="line">But I'm glad to crow about this failure, because I've been seeing more and more references to Tradesports on sites I read, and they're almost always unilluminating — or they're at least frustrating, since I have no idea who and how many participate in these markets. Apologies to my journalist friends — I realize that graphs from online futures markets are one of the greatest labor-saving devices to hit your profession since the invention of Lexis Nexis or Larry Sabato. But they're still sort of boring-slash-infuriating.</div>
<div class="line">As far as I can see, all that these markets get you is an honest effort on the part of their participants. Homerism and marketing within such systems become dramatically more expensive than such practices are elsewhere, which discourages dishonest behavior. That could certainly be useful when it comes to predicting sports outcomes or box office grosses or any number of other endeavors where prognosticators could have a motivation to deceive or insufficient motivation to carefully evaluate the problem.</div>
<div class="line">But when it comes to things like <a class="reference external" href="http://www.wired.com/news/politics/0,1283,59818,00.html">terrorism</a> or <a class="reference external" href="http://hurricanefutures.miami.edu/">hurricanes</a>, the futures market idea seems incoherent to me — unless you believe in its particular brand of magic (many open source enthusiasts are guilty of this, I should note, but they're no less wrong to do so). Experts in these rarified fields are presumably already doing their best to make objective predictions based upon all the data they can find: there are career-related mechanisms in place to encourage them to do so. Adding more voices and weighting them by cash on hand seems unlikely to be as useful as listening to and evaluating the justifications behind each voice's prediction.</div>
<div class="line">Basically, I don't see how you can divorce the qualifications of the contributor from the valuation placed upon his or her opinion. A desire to make money may be enough to qualify someone to predict how the Wizards are going to do, but I don't really see how it could help me figure out when a hurricane is going to make landfall.</div>
<div class="line">Admittedly, political outcomes seem more suited to the idea... but not in this case! So yeah: get bent, futures markets. Arguments make for more interesting reading than market graphs ever will.</div>
