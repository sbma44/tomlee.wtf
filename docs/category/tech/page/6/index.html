                    <p>Will Wilkinson is <a class="reference external" href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2012/04/technology-politics-and-hope">too kind to me</a>, but too cruel in general:</p>
<blockquote>
[The] hyperventilating false drama about never-delivered transformative change is by no means unique to the tech beat. Here on the politics blogs, we're only too happy to remind our readers that every coming election is the most important election in a generation, that the fate of our civilisation depends upon which of two barely discernible politicians' cronies get paid. If we can't generate a narrative with live-or-die stakes out of meaningless developments in public-opinion polls, then we've got nothing worthwhile to offer. Reflecting too often upon the ultimate triviality of almost everything we write about does no good for technology or politics writers, or for their readers. The illusion that the next thing will be truly meaningful has always meant more to us than the reality of the next thing. I agree with Mr Lee that there is something quite sad in the way Mr Madrigal, after having discovered that he has been reporting on nothing of significance, does not then go on to draw the well-warranted conclusion that he has wasted some of the best years of his youth foolishly yammering on about ephemera, but instead doubles down and declares &quot;we all better hope that the iPhone 5 has some crazy surprises in store for us later this year&quot;. But it's only sad because life is sad. Really, why not roll the rock back up the hill?</blockquote>
<p>I am rarely out-gloomed, but I think this is one such instance. So let me present a case for technology being meaningful. I think it's possible! Anyone who knows me can tell you that, contra my somewhat embittered bloggy pronouncements, I love technology. I mess around with Arduino on weekends; I obsessively amass, modchip and then fail to actually play game consoles; I spent my holiday building a programmable array of Christmas lights; and I can put my hand on a Digikey packing slip without leaving my bed (though this last credential is perhaps as much about messiness as it is about geekiness).</p>
<p>The point is that I believe in this stuff. Information technology, in particular, is incredibly powerful and democratically accessible, and I genuinely think it can improve our society. When you see me getting upset about the tech industry, it's because I feel that others have lost sight of this. They're making this inspiring thing I love into a silly business school game, or they're making ignorant promises -- on my behalf, it feels like! -- about things they don't understand and which won't ever come to pass. Loudmouths are distracting from good work done humbly. Fuck those guys; I hate 'em. I wish they would shut up and go away. But since they won't, we might as well get on with things.</p>
<p>If you're someone with technical skills, hopefully you you will prove to be better at ignoring those people than I have. Aside from that, I'd like to talk about the ways that I feel a career making technology can be meaningful. Because I really do believe it's possible; I would hate the people who know me, who work with me, to read this blog and conclude that I feel otherwise.</p>
<p>Not, mind you, that your job has to define you. There's nothing wrong with doing an honest day's work and coming home to enjoy your family, or partner, or dog. Pick up a hobby. Enjoy your vacations. In a few short decades you will only exist as the memories of your loved ones. A few more and you'll be nothing more than a couple of kilobytes in the Mormons' genealogical databases. I wish I had a better deal to offer, but by all accounts history is relentless, and it seems assured that rocking back and forth muttering/tweeting about &quot;innovation&quot; and &quot;disruption&quot; will be no charm against it. The important thing is to try not to waste the time you have on stupid bullshit.</p>
<p>I should warn you: this will be grandiose and sappy. To wit:</p>
<div class="section" id="improve-the-world">
<h2>Improve the World</h2>
<p>Yes, the hi-tech, still-quite-expensive things that you build will mostly be used by rich people. That's just a for-now thing, though. Smartphone adoption is already better than home broadband penetration. Speaking <em>very</em> conservatively, in two generations, everyone in America will be using this technology. In four, I'd bet on everyone in the world using it. And in the meantime, you can push on the decisionmakers. Correcting asymmetries of information can ameliorate asymmetries of power, despite <a class="reference external" href="http://gurstein.wordpress.com/2010/09/02/open-data-empowering-the-empowered-or-effective-data-use-for-everyone/">the occasional troublingly counterintuitive result</a>. Look at what <a class="reference external" href="http://publiclaboratory.org/home">Public Laboratory</a> is doing: democratizing technology to make it possible for ordinary people to monitor and -- hopefully -- legally defend the quality of their environment. I'm admittedly biased, but I find their work incredibly inspiring.</p>
<p>A lot of efficiency gains are made possible by better information -- <a class="reference external" href="http://www.greenbuttondata.org/">dynamic energy pricing systems</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://relayrides.com/">car</a>- and <a class="reference external" href="https://toronto.bixi.com/corporate/bixi-corpo">bike</a>-sharing fleets, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nest.com/">programmable thermostats</a>. Information technology has a real role to play in keeping the earth habitable.</p>
<p>But you don't have to know anything about IR filters or weather balloons or Arduino to make a difference. Designing a webform that serves the needs of some fraction of a social worker's clients, freeing resources for others: that's work that isn't flashy, but is truly important. By way of example, my friend Chris helped build a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.mixmarket.org/">clearinghouse of performance data for the microfinance sector</a>, and though I know the day-to-day development experience was nearly indistinguishable from any other CMS-project-hell, it still seems to me a very fine thing to have done. I'm sure that toiling on the EHR problem is even more mind-numbing, and yet it's unquestionably of huge potential importance. Writing a line of code can feel very distant from the act of directly alleviating human suffering, but that distance is and will continue to shrink.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="create-knowledge">
<h2>Create Knowledge</h2>
<p>The callowness and innumeracy of those promoting the Big Data brand almost defies belief, but (I should remind myself more frequently) it's important not to let this distort your perspective. Yes, there are dopes who don't understand that a properly selected sample of their (inevitably clickstream or social media) data could get them the same &quot;insights&quot; (always insights) as their massive Hadoop infrastructure. Plus it would let them use scientific-looking error bars, which I bet they would enjoy.</p>
<p>But there really are problems in need of solving which are bigger than human cognition. The gulf between the people who think their FitBits will extend their lifespan and the people working on actual computational biology problems is vast, but those willing to traverse it should be celebrated. There are archives to be digitized, regressions to be run, extraterrestrial radio signals to be processed. There are <a class="reference external" href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/superfastmatch/duzeewx_7-0/pzCqzFVtxxgJ">more disciplines than I can imagine</a> that could make use of our skills if only they were introduced to them.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="make-art">
<h2>Make Art</h2>
<p>All of this stuff is changing us, and we're going to need to spend some time figuring out how -- particularly as the energies, quantities and general magnitudes of the things we can manipulate grow ever more threateningly huge. Somehow we're going to have to give this old monkey brain the slip.</p>
<p>That would be the pragmatic case, but maybe it's foolish to try to mount one. What better thing could there be to spend your time on than making beauty? Besides, you'd be hard-pressed to read much of <a class="reference external" href="http://rhizome.org/">rhizome.org</a> or the (now-defunct) <a class="reference external" href="http://new-aesthetic.tumblr.com/">New Aesthetic Tumblr</a> or the increasingly philosophically-minded indie game scene and not come away convinced that a bunch of exciting, fast-moving (and yes, somewhat insufferable) conversations are reaching crescendo <em>right now</em>. It's getting to be the part of the party where you have to shout to be heard, and either everyone will start to dance or there'll be a fight or we'll get up on the roof. <em>Something</em> interesting is sure to happen -- it probably already is, in fact.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="try-at-the-very-least-not-to-hurt-anyone">
<h2>Try, At The Very Least, Not To Hurt Anyone</h2>
<p>There are a few subdisciplines that you should probably stay away from. &quot;Neuromarketing,&quot; Zynga-style games, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2012/04/ff_klout/">Klout scores</a> and other algorithmic approaches to eliminating human agency, dignity and/or equality strike me as basically evil, and though the trend they represent is probably unstoppable, I sure wouldn't want to be associated with it. Ditto becoming one of the quants designing the HFT engines of tomorrow, or one of the parasites that make their living off of SEO.</p>
<p>On the more benign/less high-skill end of the spectrum, coupon sites are starting to look less like a positive-sum marketing interaction and more like a system for skimming small businesses' revenue. This model has been deployed to arguably good effect in the past (newspapers! Gmail!), but this latter phase seems to merely be subsidizing my fellow yuppies' lifestyles in a sort of bizarrely regressive retail sales tax scheme. If you have the economic freedom to choose, I'm confident that you'll be able to find something more productive to do with your time and talents.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="if-you-absolutely-must-play-the-startup-game">
<h2>If You Absolutely Must Play The Startup Game</h2>
<p>Understand that you're unlikely to come up with a million dollar idea solely by sticking together free software like so many legos, hoping that lightning will strike and you'll wake up to a valuable population of users who are now pleasantly locked into your product by network effects and/or transition costs. Sure, it happens -- for now, Instagram still counts as an example rather than a punchline -- but a lotto ticket offers only slightly worse odds, and requires you to spend much less time fiddling with Keynote. It's simply too easy for other, smarter people to have the same idea and build it. Competitive markets are good for consumers and bad for entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>But if the startup dream compels you, I would suggest two things.</p>
<p>First, realize that ICT makes information cheaper. That's it, really. If you want to earn money with this technology, you should look for tractable problem areas where information is still expensive.</p>
<p>Second, connect your project to the logistical nightmare that is the real world. Ship physical goods, install a bikesharing fleet, go meet with the bureaucracy to get the data you need for your business intelligence site. These things are hard to do without leaving the house (or at least picking up the phone), and consequently fewer of them are being done. Another handy heuristic bucket: pursue ideas that require capital for things other than loft space, foosball tables and your bar tab. The low hanging fruit has been plucked, in other words. Reach higher. It'll certainly be more interesting, and you might even improve your odds.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="i-m-a-lucky-guy">
<h2>I'm a Lucky Guy</h2>
<p>I've already copped to not being a startup guy myself. I guess I should probably acknowledge that I'm not a particularly cheerful person, either. But while I have admittedly made some terrible decisions, my professional choices haven't been half bad, if I do say so myself. I'm extremely grateful to have the opportunity I do: one that affords me the chance to do work that I count as meaningful across a couple of the above dimensions.</p>
<p>I can't guarantee you'll have the good fortune I've had in finding a fulfilling way to spend your workdays, but I do wish you luck at not wasting your time.</p>

                    <p>Spencer is <a class="reference external" href="http://spencerackerman.typepad.com/attackerman/2011/07/nexus-7.html">right</a>: <a class="reference external" href="http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2011/07/darpas-secret-spy-machine/all/1">this Wired piece about DARPA's Nexus 7 initiative is very good</a>. Nexus 7 is an ambitious data processing effort meant to synthesize both traditional signals (e.g. vehicle tracking data) and unorthodox signals (market fruit prices seem to be their favorite example) into useful intelligence through sophisticated analytic techniques taken from the social sciences.</p>
<p>And it's a pretty good reminder of why I'm wary of the Big Data movement. &nbsp;These were my two favorite bits:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On the surface, there wasn’t much to it: just a graph of violence in the Jalalabad region, and a plot of those fruit prices. When the level of violence was stable — reliably low, or reliably high — so were those prices. Fruit sellers knew what to expect. But when there were sudden swings in the number of attacks, the prices shot up.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Nexus 7 team said, you could use the fruit as an indirect indicator of instability.</p>
<p>The reaction was less than rapturous.</p>
<p>“Right from the start, I’m like: Oh. My. God,” one of the people who attended a Nexus 7 presentation tells Danger Room. “A high school kid could do that.”</p>
<p>Afterward, Dugan presented the pilot as a triumph — a “big breakthrough” that impressed a bevy of four-star generals.</p>
<p>Privately, she was underwhelmed. Dugan was looking for projects that could save troops’ lives, and maybe even bend the direction of the war. By that standard, fruit-price swings seemed pretty inconsequential.</p>
<p>But the presenters maintained an aura of confidence. Oh, this is just a test. Give us more data sources, they said, and we’ll make better connections. We’ve got the hardware: a cloud computing platform that would soak up all kinds of classified and open source intelligence data. We’ve got the software: these social science PhDs and counterinsurgency veterans, who can figure out how to apply that data to rebuild Afghanistan.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and:</p>
<blockquote>
&quot;One assumed there was some secret mound of data to be exploited. But it’s just not true.&quot;</blockquote>
<p>I've fallen prey to this temptation: thinking that your mastery of <em>awesome tools</em> means you're about to do some <em>awesome stuff</em> (perhaps via some cleverly counterintuitive Freakonomic insight). Unfortunately, it's not that easy. You actually need to have a great idea before great things will happen, and it's difficult to come up with great ideas unless you both know and care -- deeply -- about the topic you're planning to examine.</p>
<p>It's important to acknowledge that the story of Nexus 7 seems to be told, to some extent, from the perspective of people in the military establishment who feel insulted or threatened by the project. &nbsp;But that in itself is telling: it's never a good idea to enter a field of inquiry with the assumption that those who preceded you were well-meaning simpletons -- particularly when your reasons for thinking so boil down to a difference in the complexity of your tools.</p>
<p>I think this same story is about to unfold in the tech industry, albeit with a more cheerful tone. &nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/jobs_for_data_scientists_explode_across_the_market.php">Consider this recent post from Read Write Web about the explosion in job listings mentioning the phrase &quot;data scientist&quot;</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
&quot;Right now, everybody with data knows that there's value in there, that they should be doing something,&quot; says Edd Dumbill, program chair for&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://strataconf.com/">Strata</a>, O'Reilly's new conference on Data.&nbsp;&quot;Trouble is, nobody's entirely clear on the next steps, but they do know that a data scientist can help frame questions and transform data into useful insight.&quot;</blockquote>
<p>They don't &quot;know&quot; this. They're assuming it. &nbsp;And this leaves me worried, because the ability to draw meaning from mountains of information is almost always going to depend on the specific question being examined more so than the tools being used or the investigator's level of enthusiasm for the idea of quantitative analysis.</p>
<p>It's not that I don't believe in the techniques and tools that have these folks so excited. &nbsp;It's not even that I think nothing will come of data-rich firms applying quantitative analytic techniques. These things have got me excited, too! &nbsp;I'm trying to make sure we take advantage of the same kinds of tools at work. &nbsp;Still, there's no substitute for good ideas.</p>
<p>To me, this wave of hype doesn't seem much different from the one that occurred at the start of the last decade. &nbsp;&quot;Look at the power of webservers and online payment processing!&quot; we exclaimed. &quot;Can you imagine the benefits they'll yield when applied to the problem of selling pet food?&quot;</p>
<p>Those things <em>are</em> powerful. But that's beside the point.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>There were two good pieces on NPR this morning discussing the reaction to Wikileaks.</p>
<p>First, there's <a class="reference external" href="http://www.npr.org/2010/12/13/131979010/corporations-are-drawn-into-wikileaks-controversy">this story</a>, which briefly gets at some of the concerns about Twitter as a platform for activism that I tried to express in <a class="reference external" href="http://www.prospect.org/cs/articles?article=the_cost_of_hashtag_revolution">this piece</a>. The point Shirky makes is an important one: so much vital expression now happens in privately-controlled mediums that nominal speech rights are often a bit beside the point. This, combined with the fact that we seem to be relitigating the &quot;should shield laws apply to bloggers?&quot; question, makes me think that we're collectively more confused about how you can and ought to be able to speak on the internet than I would've expected. Hopefully we'll muddle our way through to a productive conclusion.</p>
<p>Second, they did a piece <a class="reference external" href="http://www.npr.org/2010/12/13/132015315/as-u-s-hunts-hacktivists-some-ask-is-it-worth-it">discussing the costs of prosecuting participants in Operation Payback</a>, and it's also worth a read. I'm sympathetic to the basic dilemma: going after the participants is a lot like calling in Interpol for a vandalism case. Individual actors are only responsible for substantial damage when considered together; and nobody's very happy about the idea of locking up bored rich kids. Still, it's worth keeping in mind that <em>this is what a hard computer crime problem looks like</em>. It's not thrilling to me to read that the FBI and DOJ are basically shrugging their shoulders and saying, &quot;Eh, that sounds too hard.&quot; This is all the more galling when these agencies <em>are</em> bothering to pursue computer crime enforcement agendas around intellectual property. Like it or not, distributed international attacks are the class of problem most in need of solving.</p>
<p>One other thing I'd add: keep an eye on how useful the &quot;cybersecurity&quot; community makes itself during this process. My guess is that they'll keep their traps shut (or at least spend their time gleefully fretting about what kind of funding requests Stuxnet will necessitate) while the &quot;computer security&quot; community does the hard work of grappling with the Operation Payback DDoS. On the other hand, I suppose the cybersec guys were probably the ones behind DDoSing Wikileaks, so, y'know, your tax dollars at work.</p>
<p>Third: about that DDoS. I'm not sure what to say about it, really. I find the argument that it <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cpeterson.org/2009/07/21/in-praise-of-some-ddoss/">can be considered civil disobedience</a> to be more compelling than I would've expected. I'm somewhat sympathetic to arguments like the one <a class="reference external" href="http://timothyblee.com/2010/12/10/the-case-against-ddos/">Tim makes here</a> (or that's discussed in <a class="reference external" href="http://www.deannazandt.com/2010/12/12/legitimate-civil-disobedience-wikileaks-and-the-layers-of-backlash/comment-page-1/#comment-46538">this comment</a>). But I think the idea that past instances of civil disobedience were done in an orderly manner by uniformly thoughtful people who did their best not to inconvenience anyone else is probably wishful thinking. I'm no expert on this stuff, but that strikes me as the sort of perceptual shift that happens after a movement is vindicated by history. You're going to have to piss some people off. Otherwise you might as well go schedule a protest march for all the good it'll do you.</p>
<p>And although I'm not particularly sympathetic to Payback's targeting of Amazon — cowardly though the firm's behavior may have been, too many others rely on the AWS infrastructure, and there are plenty of hosts out there — the payment-processing and DNS control points now being counter-attacked by Operation Payback really do represent worrying concentrations of power. These systems are controlled by entities that are immune to public oversight, yet seem to be completely compliant when state agents ask them to restrict their customers' liberty. That's a recipe that should worry libertarians a lot more than it seems to.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there's Gawker. And although it's probably a mistake to conflate all of these actors, there do seem to be some connections. The &quot;Anonymous&quot; community is becoming a sort of petulant digital Fight Club that's going to be very difficult to combat, and which behaves in a chaotic and unprincipled manner. That they're targeting those who <em>dare to talk about them</em> is pretty dismaying; that the only way to respond seems likely to be a combination of quiet state cooption of ISPs and throwing children in jail — that's incredibly depressing.</p>

                    <p>Alex Payne <a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/al3x/status/25614922261">points</a> to a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.links.org/?p=998&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+links%2FZvUZ+%28Ben+Laurie+Blathering%29">blog post by Ben Laurie</a> that discusses Diaspora and Haystack, and how projects like these can attract huge amounts of press, only to flame out as their charismatic founders' incompetence is revealed.</p>
<p>I agree with Ben's post, but it's worth being a bit more explicit about what allows these situations to arise: the quality of most tech journalism is abysmal. I mean really inexcusably bad. Mainstream publications regularly assign writers to cover the software industry that have a level of understanding regarding the field that would be unacceptable in an intern. The most esteemed practitioners in the tech press are either focused on the consumer electronic user experience or are building personal brands around faith-based tech triumphalist movements.</p>
<p>In this sort of environment, it should be no surprise that an embarrassing hype cycle can emerge -- one that talented self-promoters will use to enhance their status and wealth. I find it difficult to assign all that much blame to those self-promoters: the whole problem is that <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect">they don't know any better</a>. What more can we expect? Besides, it's very easy to start believing your own bullshit once people with seemingly-meaningful professional credentials start validating it. Self-promoters will self promote; it's not realistic to expect them to be the ones providing diligence.</p>
<p>I suspect that the problem may have to do with the structure of the industry: if you know much about it, you're probably going to be able to make more money participating in it than writing about it. I don't know enough about finance to really judge, but it seems as though that press sector suffers from a similar systemic disability -- certainly all can agree that the financial press didn't cover itself in glory in advance of the recent financial crisis. Once that story became big enough, talented generalist journalists filtered in and did the job properly.</p>
<p>But unless and until the skill premium for the software industry diminishes relative to journalism I'm not sure there's a good way to align incentives in a way that fixes this problem. The best we can do is to recognize that the journalists who wrote excitedly about Haystack and Diaspora made a mistake; they were fooled, and they wasted our time. There's no need to tar and feather anyone, but their credibility needs to suffer if we want this situation to improve.</p>
<p>Maybe we don't need it to improve! It's not that important, to be perfectly honest. But it sure does bug the hell out of me.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>Way back when, I wrote a <a class="reference external" href="http://dcist.com/map/">Google Maps application</a> for <a class="reference external" href="http://www.dcist.com">DCist</a> that overlaid the DC Metro system on the usual GMaps tiles. People found it useful -- me especially, since I think it helped me land a job at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.echoditto.com">EchoDitto</a>.&nbsp; Its only real innovation was some simple, hacked-up geometry that would horrify a cartographer, but which allowed me to make an attractive map that recalled <a class="reference external" href="http://wmata.com/rail/maps/map.cfm">the more stylized WMATA map</a>.&nbsp; It wasn't rocket science, but I still occasionally get emails from developers asking me how I did it (which is slightly bizarre, given that the code is right there for them to see).</p>
<p>In 2007 the GMaps API got an update, and <a class="reference external" href="http://dcist.com/2007/07/13/dcist_maps_come.php">I converted the project into something called a mapplet</a>. I had to rewrite a few things, but it was more or less the same.&nbsp; The main difference was that mapplets were used through the maps.google.com interface -- you could add a bunch at the same time, but you could still use Local Search and permalinking and comments about businesses and other Googly innovations from within the interface.&nbsp; I didn't have to implement any of that stuff!&nbsp; Instead, users could simply have their polished Google Maps experience supplemented by my modest mapplet.&nbsp; Handy.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, over the last few weeks I've started receiving reports that the mapplet's behaving weirdly.&nbsp; Load the mapplet, then do a search for something -- the station markers will disappear, and sometimes some of the lines that are supposed to connect them will, too.&nbsp; It looked to me like an event handler had started working differently, so I went to investigate.</p>
<p>Alas!&nbsp; It turns out that v2 of the API has been deprecated.&nbsp; They're on to v3 (not so bad) and they've discontinued the mapplet platform entirely (bad)!</p>
<p>I can still make the lines appear on a Google Map.&nbsp; But I don't think I can do it on the maps.google.com interface.&nbsp; This is a drag: I don't think the thing's half as useful as a standalone product as it is when it supplements search functionality.&nbsp; And I really don't want to reimplement the entire maps.google.com interface (even though, yes, they expose the API for their local search stuff).</p>
<p>So! Developers! Anyone out there dealt with this? I'm not eager to dump a huge amount of time back into this project -- a project that's increasingly unnecessary thanks to Google Transit and the addition of transit stations to the GMaps tileset, but which is still useful when you're working at a modestly wide zoom level.&nbsp; But it would be nice to get things working again.</p>

                    <p><a class="reference external" href="http://motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2010/03/you-and-your-browser">Kevin Drum elects to take security advice from Microsoft</a>. This is not a good idea!</p>
<p>In a nutshell: MS says that users ignore warnings about unsigned encryption keys, which makes those warnings useless.&nbsp; Some browsers, like Firefox, make it <em>really difficult</em> to ignore unsigned keys, but that's annoying, and MS says we should abandon such efforts.</p>
<p>This is wrong.&nbsp; Those warnings are saying: &quot;The URL you entered means that you've asked for a snoop-proof connection, so okay, your connection to this server is encrypted; however, <em>I can't verify that this server is who it's claiming to be</em>.&quot;&nbsp; Your conversation with the server will be private, but you could be subject to a so-called man-in-the-middle attack, whereby someone hijacks the local network segment you're on and starts speaking on behalf of, say, bankofamerica.com.&nbsp; The magic of the certificate authority system means that they can't do this without generating a warning.</p>
<p>There is one caveat: if they simply don't try to use encryption, the warning won't be generated.&nbsp; This is one of the reasons why you're supposed to check for <a class="reference external" href="https://">https://</a> in the URL whenever you submit sensitive information; not just so that your password isn't available to everyone else on the Bolt Bus (though that's a good reason, too), but also so that anyone pretending to be a server they're not will get caught.&nbsp; Unfortunately, people aren't very good at checking for that little s in the URL or that little key icon or whatever other little security indicator your browser provides, so the bad guys just direct their victims to unsecured sites.</p>
<p>That's too bad, but it isn't a sign that warnings about unsigned keys are bad ideas.&nbsp; Actually, the fact that phishers have drifted away from that link in the security chain means that <em>it's working properly</em>.&nbsp; Weakening it isn't any kind of solution.&nbsp; MS security researchers would be better-served by spending more time thinking about how to get people to notice when they ought to be using a secure site.</p>

<p>I read the article, though, and found myself disagreeing with its author, Marisa Meltzer.&nbsp; How can you provide an accounting of Tumblr's success and not use the word &quot;Gawker&quot; once?&nbsp; The service was launched in New York in the right kind of scene, was pitched in the right kind of way, attracted the right kind of writers, and grew from there. Like so many successful products, you can't simply run Tumblr's featureset backward through the perfectly-deterministic mechanism of the imagined market and arrive at a proper accounting of why it succeeded and its competitors failed.</p>
<p>I agree that it's worth talking about the subtle mechanics of the site -- how there's a thumbs-up mechanism but no thumbs-down; I think the consolidation of reader and blog into a single form is a genuinely interesting idea. But Meltzer's account seemed to me a bit like explaining the success of the iPod via a discussion of its clickwheel.</p>

                    <p>It's hardly worth noting, but <a class="reference external" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/09/27/AR2009092703026.html">this</a> is a lousy editorial.&nbsp; A couple of points, one of which I buried in the last post about net neutrality:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Comcast's reversal of its decision to fiddle with Bittorrent seems to be getting bandied about as an example of the market taking care of things. People should be less sanguine: it was not market pressure from clients but rather PR pressure from activists that forced Comcast to back down.&nbsp; And if the net neutrality issue hadn't been looming at the time, the outcome could easily have been different.&nbsp; Mustering that level of coordinated outrage is not a sustainable model for policing ISP behavior.&nbsp; Other ISPs offer evidence of gloomier scenarios: in Canada, Rogers has been throttling Bittorrent -- and, in fact, all encrypted traffic, since it can't distinguish encrypted BT from encrypted anything-else -- since at least 2005.&nbsp; Similar difficulties face customers of some Australian ISPs.&nbsp; And there are other policies that have been in place so long that people have stopped complaining: unless something has changed, I'm still prohibited from running a server for personal use off my home connection (in principle a server of any type; in practice, port 80 is the only one that will be caught). And it was years -- years! -- before Comcast disclosed or even acknowledged the existence of its secret bandwidth caps.&nbsp; Neutrality opponents are mistaking a single victorious battle for the absence of a war.</li>
<li>The Post piece refers to the broadband market as &quot;a vibrant and well-functioning marketplace&quot;. In truth, it's <a class="reference external" href="http://www.dslreports.com/shownews/Global-Broadband-Prices-Plummet-98942">stagnated</a>: in North America, prices remain steady -- at a rate above what much of the developed world pays -- while ongoing improvements in speed show little hope for of catching up with the networks of countries significantly poorer than the US.&nbsp; If the Post wants to argue that net neutrality will make the situation even worse, fine. But they don't even seem to realize that by global standards our domestic broadband marketplace is an underperformer.</li>

<p>See, I'm going to be heading back from Philly this Sunday, and many Sundays besides, and I'd rather not miss the whole goddamn football season.&nbsp; If WTEM provided an MP3 stream this would be no problem -- the FStream iPhone app would let me listen to the game on stretches of I-95 well beyond the anemic reach of 980 AM.</p>
<p>That's not the case, though.&nbsp; WTEM uses a Flash-based streaming system, apparently through a vendor called streamtheworld.com.&nbsp; That's fine for the web browser, but the iPhone's too stupid to deal with Flash.</p>
<p>So I set out to provide an alternate stream.&nbsp; Amazon offers on-demand virtual servers through its EC2 service, and my first thought was to fire one of those up for each game.&nbsp; At ten cents an hour it would be affordable, and I could use the more-competent server to transcode the Flash stream into a more iPhone-compatible MP3 stream.</p>
<p>I got far enough along this path that I might as well share my work.&nbsp; Here's a quick recipe for setting up a VLC-transcoding-capable server on EC2:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">Launch the following Ubuntu AMI: ami-ed46a784</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Make sure that you've opened port 8080 in the relevant security settings.</p>
</li>
<li><div class="first line-block">
<div class="line">Execute these commands:</div>
</div>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">apt-get -y update</div>
<div class="line">apt-get -y install libmp3lame-dev</div>
<div class="line">apt-get -y install ffmpeg libavcodec-unstripped-52</div>
<div class="line">apt-get -y install vlc vlc-plugin-esd mozilla-plugin-vlc</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><div class="first line-block">
<div class="line">Execute something similar to, but not quite this:</div>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>sudo -u nobody vlc -vvv &quot;<a class="reference external" href="http://208.80.52.80/WTEMAM">http://208.80.52.80/WTEMAM</a>&quot; --sout '#transcode{acodec=mp3,ab=64}:standard{access=http,mux=asf,dst=}'</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This is close.&nbsp; It's <em>really</em> close.&nbsp; If you run this and then load up <a class="reference external" href="http://www.videolan.org">VLC</a> -- the amazingly useful media player -- and connect to the AMI on port 8080, you'll get a 64 kbps transcoded MP3 stream of the WTEM flash audio stream.&nbsp; It works well!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I don't know the specific incantation that makes this MP3 stream compatible with <a class="reference external" href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=289892007&amp;mt=8">FStream</a> on the iPhone.&nbsp; I tried various playlist formats.&nbsp; I tried various audio formats.&nbsp; I tried various container formats.&nbsp; There doesn't seem to be any decent documentation on the internet telling me what to do.&nbsp; It just says it's connecting, forever.</p>
<p>But while searching for a solution I discovered something interesting: there's an iPhone version of VLC!&nbsp; True, it's 13 megs, and yeah, it's only available on jailbroken phones (via the Cydia package manager).&nbsp; But it works great!&nbsp; I pointed it at <a class="reference external" href="http://208.80.52.80/WTEMAM">http://208.80.52.80/WTEMAM</a> and it started spitting out incomprehensible sports radio babble almost immediately.&nbsp; Admittedly, that was over wifi.&nbsp; But I see no reason to expect it to perform any worse over 3G than an equivalent MP3 stream would.&nbsp; I'll be giving it a shot on Sunday during the Giants game. And while I'm sorry to not be providing an MP3 stream for other fans, I'm glad to offer another reason to jailbreak your phone.</p>

                    <p>Tim <a class="reference external" href="http://timothyblee.com/?p=452">wades in</a> to the debate about robots replacing low-skilled workers. I don't think I <a class="reference external" href="/2009/08/09/will-machines-render-low-skilled-workers-useless/">made my case</a> as strongly as I could have, and consequently I can't resist responding, if only briefly.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>I didn't react to the &quot;cost of materials and energy&quot; argument as forcefully as I should have. I really, really, really don't think this is going to be an issue. Machines are <em>much</em> more efficient than humans -- that's sort of the whole point. It's not at all a subtle difference, but rather a massive leap (they don't call the first sweeping wave of automation a revolution for nothing). The price of technology continues to fall. And the energy costs we're talking about are slight: keeping a Roomba charged takes about <a class="reference external" href="http://www.treehugger.com/files/2008/12/this-or-that-roomba-versus-upright.php">a third as much power</a> as illuminating the lamp on your nightstand -- and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/C/AE_compact_fluorescent_lamp.html">that's if the lamp is using a compact fluorescent bulb</a>.</li>
<li>Tim's discussion of our hardwired preference for other humans is an interesting one. But I'm not sure this is a problem that will be as resistant to engineering as he thinks. Consider <a class="reference external" href="http://www.japantrendshop.com/paro-robotic-healing-seal-p-144.html">Paro, the robot seal</a>. By all accounts he works pretty well at soothing nursing home patients. Tim's probably right that people would prefer -- and pay for -- a human R.N. rather than Rosie the Robot in nursing scrubs. But if a suite of relatively simple assistive technologies is cheaper than either -- partially automated showers, biomonitors, pill reminders and the like -- they'll probably settle for that.</li>
</ol>
<p>Human labor remaining competitive with robots seems to assume that one of two things will happen.</p>
<p>First, wages for unskilled labor could be pushed even further down. Presumably this is supposed to happen as average income continues to rise. I'm not sure how this can be considered feasible, either practically or ethically -- we're basically talking about reinventing the serf.</p>
<p>Second, robots could become dramatically less economical due to some sort of resource or energy shock. But given robotic efficiency (and the reality of their still-falling prices), it's hard for me to envision this happening except in the sort of catastrophic scenario in which maintaining human employment levels would be the least of our worries.</p>

<li>The app crashes as soon as you try to do anything after the map loads.</li>
<li>There are way too many pins. And I don't want them to be pins anyway.

                    <p>It seems like the Iranian cyberactivist movement has marked the entrance of the term DDoS into our culture's shared vocabulary. There's a big DDoS attack going on right now, in fact: the Post <a class="reference external" href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/securityfix/2009/07/washington_post_white_house_fa.html?hpid=topnews">has coverage</a> (they're among the targets), and I heard a piece about it this morning on NPR. Governments are among the victims. People are starting to notice that the agencies responsible for dealing with this stuff don't have the power to do much more than write whitepapers. Governments are going to start doing things about it.</p>
<p>I think this will likely take two forms:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Legislated standards for ISPs. In particular, I imagine we'll see ports for IRC and SMTP, if not all non-http ports, move to a default-closed state. I'm not sure how you'll opt into opening them, but SMS verification of an online request seems to be increasing in popularity (my bank does this; Google does, too, when you start to use their App Engine service). There'll also likely be incentives or mandates put in place for things like server-side antivirus scanning of email attachments. The details matter quite a lot — the possibility of a corporate power-grab that constrains citizens' ability to interact securely is real — but I think such attacks can be fought off, and the result will probably be a good thing on the whole.</li>
<li>These ISP standards could conceivably get written into trade agreements, at which point a more politically interesting possibility will arise: the imposition of economic or network sanctions against nations judged to have an out-of-control internet. Is there a damaging DoS attack coming from South Korea? Is that country's government judged not to have adequate standards in place to fight or prevent it? Cut 'em off the network, or throttle their traffic. There's a constituency for this: the WIPO people would be only too happy to have this capability.
This opens up other interesting possibilities. For one thing, the mutually destructive nature of sanctions would become immediately clear to internet users in a way that isn't always obvious in the comparatively sluggish realm of trade. And for another, online false flag operations would become a more serious concern. A hacker group could conceivably blackmail a small, cloutless nation under the threat of eliciting an international network crackdown.</li>
</ul>
<p>It'll be interesting (and no doubt horrifying) to see deep packet inspection debated on the House floor. I think we're headed that way, though.</p>
<p>Oh yeah: let me plug <a class="reference external" href="http://www.csoonline.com/article/print/220336">this article</a>, which is the more entertaining narrative about a DoS attack that I've come across.</p>

They assert their copyright on arrival times; they demand licensing agreements, yet refuse to do so on a small scale; and, perhaps most astoundingly, they say that free iPhone apps count as commercial use of the data because apple sells the iPhone on the strength of the app store's offerings. Ugh.</p>
<p>On the bright side, the technical aspects of my work on a map-based NextBus iPhone app are proceeding well. At the moment there are no obvious obstacles that need to be overcome. That's not to say those obstacles don't exist — they almost certainly do — but a <em>seemingly</em> clear path ahead is about the best you can hope for in a technical project.</p>
<p>Oh, and I had another look at the GTFS/NextBus stop match-up. The news is still bad. I'd hoped that the average distance between stops was being pulled up by a few bad matches, but that doesn't seem to be the case. In fact there are only about two dozen matched stops closer than 10m from one another. I'll have another look eventually (maybe NextBus is using a different projection system?), but for now the NB dataset is sufficiently complete that I can rely on it for my work.</p>

                    <p>NextBus launched! It's exciting. I and a lot of other area developers are looking at how to take advantage of the realtime GPS data that NextBus collects to make the DC transit system easier to use. I haven't gotten too far with it — I'm just poking around — but the early word is that NextBus isn't going to make this easy.</p>
<p>First: they're claiming copyright on the location of metrobuses. They serve their data as XML, and each &lt;body&gt; tag looks like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<tt class="docutils literal">&lt;body <span class="pre">copyright=&quot;All</span> data copyright NextBus 2009. Allowed use is for noncommercial purposes <span class="pre">only.&quot;&gt;</span></tt></blockquote>
<p>Not great. But okay, whatever — whether this data is copyrightable in a meaningful sense is the first question; whether WMATA willingly sold off their bus locations is the second. But realistically, NextBus can apply whatever license terms on their service that they'd like, and can plausibly enforce them against commercial users. So that'd bring us back to where we are, which is fine.</p>
<p>But just because NextBus says it's <em>okay</em> to have the data doesn't mean they're going to make it easy. Your browser makes a lot of requests to NextBus in order to show a map, of course, but the most interesting ones are to <a class="reference external" href="http://wmata.nextbus.com/service/googleMapXMLFeed">http://wmata.nextbus.com/service/googleMapXMLFeed</a>, a script that performs a number of different operations based on what querystring parameters it's passed. For instance, <a class="reference external" href="http://wmata.nextbus.com/service/googleMapXMLFeed?command=routeConfig&amp;a=wmata&amp;r=64&amp;key=1424073267381">http://wmata.nextbus.com/service/googleMapXMLFeed?command=routeConfig&amp;a=wmata&amp;r=64&amp;key=1424073267381</a> will get you a list of stops and route geometry for the 64 bus.</p>
<p>But if you paste that URL into your browser, you'll get this:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><tt class="docutils literal">&lt;Error <span class="pre">shouldRetry=&quot;false&quot;&gt;</span></tt></div>
<div class="line">``&nbsp;&nbsp;Feed can only be accessed by NextBus map page.``</div>
<div class="line"><tt class="docutils literal">&lt;/Error&gt;</tt></div>
</div>

<p>Charming. But of course it works in the context of the map.

<p>It actually can't be that many things. There's the set of session-maintaining cookies, the HTTP referrer header, and the user agent reported by the browser (or some combination). Spoiler alert: it's the referrer. So! Borrowing the referring URL from the headers (it checks for more than just the domain), we can use <em>curl -e&quot;http://wmata.nextbus.com/googleMap/customGoogleMap.jsp?a=wmata&amp;cssFile=http://www.wmata.com/css/nextbus.css&quot; &quot;http://wmata.nextbus.com/service/googleMapXMLFeed?command=routeConfig&amp;a=wmata&amp;r=64&amp;key=1424073267381&quot;</em> and get back <a class="reference external" href="/2009/07/01/routeconfig.xml">this file</a>.</p>
<p>It's got three things in it: stops; routes, which are ordered lists of stops; and paths, which define the shape of the lines that'll be drawn to represent the routes (because roads have twists and turns, connecting stops with straight lines is insufficient).</p>
<p>This is pretty much how the GTFS dataset is organized. So you might expect to be able to match up the stops from GTFS to NextBus. Well, here's a stop from NextBus:</p>

<tt class="docutils literal">&lt;stop <span class="pre">tag=&quot;5880&quot;</span> <span class="pre">title=&quot;11th</span> St Nw + H St Nw&quot; <span class="pre">dirTag=&quot;null&quot;</span> <span class="pre">lat=&quot;38.90032&quot;</span> <span class="pre">lon=&quot;-77.02657&quot;</span> <span class="pre">stopId=&quot;1001159&quot;/&gt;</span></tt></blockquote>
<p>Here's the same stop from a fresh download of the WMATA GTFS dataset:</p>
<blockquote>
<tt class="docutils literal">7591 / NW 11TH ST &amp; NW H ST / 38.899812 / <span class="pre">-77.027053</span></tt></blockquote>
<p>It's a drag. The IDs don't match. The human-readable stop names don't match. <em>Even the latitude and longitude don't match</em>. I mean, sure, they're close. But making these line up is going to be a sloppy, relatively expensive calculation. Now, true, it probably only has to happen once. It's not that hard of a problem. It's just that it's so <em>unnecessary</em>. Ah well. I've got an email in to Metro; we'll see if they can provide a cleaner solution than the one I'm thinking about scripting up.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> <a class="reference external" href="http://blog.case.edu/gps10/2006/01/30/debugging_nextbus">Some thoughts on NextBus's javascript interface from 2006</a>. A few things have changed since then, but from my initial investigation I'd say that not <em>too</em> much is different — just URLs, mostly.</p>
<p>An alternative to messing with the protected javascript interface is to scrape the HTML for the &quot;next arrival time&quot; pages. But a) this only gets you distance-expressed-as-time, which is lousy data compared to actual lat/lon coordinates and b) it's still messy, as &quot;<a class="reference external" href="http://mihasya.com/blog/?p=203">apparently NextBus hired a live bear to write their markup</a>&quot; (the author of that post does have his <a class="reference external" href="http://github.com/mihasya/yourmuni/tree/master/">scraping code up on GitHub</a>, though).</p>

                    <p><a class="reference external" href="http://attackerman.firedoglake.com/2009/06/26/what-a-week/">Via Spencer</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://washingtontimes.com/news/2009/jun/26/protesters-use-navy-technology-to-avoid-censorship/?feat=home_headlines&amp;">an interesting article</a> about the Iranian protesters' use of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.torproject.org/">Tor</a>, The Onion Router. I'm a <a class="reference external" href="/2007/07/24/last-years-model/">big</a> <a class="reference external" href="http://www.zunta.org/blog/archives/2005/03/23/said_it_once_be/">fan</a> of Tor, and have seen it successfully used to evade dictatorial regimes in the past (specifically the people running <a class="reference external" href="http://www.manifestdensity.net/2008/01/23/nba_league_pass_from_across_ma/">NBA League Pass</a>). But it's probably worth pointing out Tor's limits as they pertain to the situation in Iran.</p>
<p>First, you really can't count on Tor for anonymity or encryption. The right way to do encryption on the internet is for your machine and the server with which it's communicating to agree on a cryptographic arrangement that begins with you and ends with it. If the server isn't expecting to receive encrypted content, it won't know what to make of any such content that it receives — that's kind of the point of encryption, right? So at some point Tor needs to decrypt your traffic and send it out onto the internet in its original, exposed form. Before it does that it passes it back and forth between who-knows-how-many nodes, concealing its point of origin. But hiding your IP address won't do you much good if malevolent actors get their hands on the eventually-decrypted content and it contains your email address, or Twitter login name, or whatever else.</p>
<p>And it's not too hard for them to do this. Tor relies on kind-hearted souls to run &quot;exit nodes&quot; — the spots where traffic gets decrypted and sent back into the plain internet. And if you run an exit node, you can easily choose to look at all of the traffic coming through it. In 2007 one clever guy <a class="reference external" href="http://www.securityfocus.com/news/11486/1">did just that</a>, and managed to capture a sensitive information being emailed by embassy staffers. Looking at the Tor <a class="reference external" href="https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-doc-relay.html.en">exit node instructions</a>, it doesn't look like any node-approval bureaucracy has been added since this incident (nor should there have been, in my opinion). So there's nothing stopping the Iranian government from setting up some exit nodes, grabbing whatever fraction of total Iranian Tor traffic lands in their laps, pulling email addresses and names from it and going after those people.</p>
<p>Nor is there any reason why Tor can't be blocked. SSL traffic — the most widely used, genuinely secure encryption on the internet (it's what protects your credit card number from snoopers when you buy something from Amazon) — is blocked in Iran. Now, given that Tor is working while SSL isn't, the latter is probably being blocked through the relatively crude measure of turning off traffic on port 443, which is the standard port associated with <a class="reference external" href="https://">https://</a> URLs. But with a semi-modern firewall it's possible to block encrypted traffic regardless of the port — I've worked in offices that do this. That would effectively kill SSH, SSL, Tor and any other way of concealing online activities from eavesdropping government agents.</p>
<p>Actually, the government could do far worse. They could allow traffic through, but flag encrypted traffic to non-commercial sites for investigation. Or they could set up man in the middle attacks and rely on users to approve the certificate warning they receive. Or they could create redirects that send people to phishing sites that resemble Twitter and capture passwords but seemlessly pass tweets through to the real Twitter and then use the credentials to secretly arrange tweetups and the attendees all <em>think</em> they're walking into an underground storefront but then why is it so dark and the doors close and they're in THE BACK OF A TRUCK and it pulls away toward who knows where! OMG! Cut to our hero!</p>
<p>But that would be a lot of trouble. And for all of the conspiracy theories floating around Twitter about Iranian sysops planting hashtags to splinter the online protest's efficacy, the actual shape of Evil Iranian IT probably looks a lot less like the climactic scenes of <em>Neuromancer</em>. That's not to say that the import of the online part of these protests is nil — I've pretty well been convinced that my initial skepticism was too extreme. But it is to say that we should resist writing any definitive-sounding encomiums about the tools being used to get internet traffic out of Iran. The sad truth is that if the monopoly ISP is run by repressive theocrats with adequate time and resources, aspiring online activists are kind of screwed. To the extent the authorities care, anything that works very well is going to stop working soon enough.</p>

                    <p><strong>Sort-of-recommended:</strong> <em>Harper's Island</em>, a CBS horror miniseries that Emily <strong>EDIT: And I! And I!</strong> began watching over the weekend. It's not good in the traditional/objective/subjective/plausible sense, but it's not all that bad. It's essentially a conventional horror movie spread over a thirteen episode miniseries. That lets the action ramp up at a pleasantly leisurely pace, but the long home stretch threatens to buckle under the weight of a series of red herrings and a body count that seems to climb simply because the writers don't know what else to do. But there are four more episodes left, so it's too early to make any definitive judgments.</p>
<p><strong>Definitely recommended:</strong> Netflix's offering of <em>Harper's Island</em> as a streamable product as the episodes air. This was a little confusing — I couldn't figure out why the number of episodes in the series was growing (has I miscounted?), and last night Emily and I were left worrying that the first season had ended with a particularly irritating cliffhanger. Actually, though, it was just Netflix serving as the on-demand service that that Comcast denies to my Tivo-having self. And they say that a la carte TV service is impossible...</p>

                    <p>Yesterday Apple announced a shiny new version of its signature mobile device. This prompted considerable acclaim. However, within hours of the announcement, new revelations emerged. It became known that — presumably due to the malign influence of AT&amp;T (a company that, unlike Apple, is capable of wrongdoing) — the new iPhone would be sold under a nefarious scheme specifically constructed to line the pockets of those peddling it at a rate brazenly designed to cover the cost of each unit's production — <a class="reference external" href="http://www.crunchgear.com/2009/06/08/want-an-iphone-3g-s-already-have-an-iphone-3g-be-prepared-to-pay-700-to-upgrade/">and even more</a>, if you can believe it!</p>
<p>As you might imagine, this has prompted considerable outrage, which has in turn spurred real grassroots action. And even if those online petitions and Twitter accounts somehow fail to force AT&amp;T to start buying Americans free electronics, surely the tide will be turned by thoughtful essays like <a class="reference external" href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/06/08/why-the-iphone-3g-s-may-be-a-suckers-bet-right-now/">this one</a>, in which the author explains why it's vitally important that companies do everything they can to accommodate the customers whose fanaticism renders them price insensitive and/or whose contractual commitment has already been secured.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Seriously, though: at $99 they're going to sell a staggering number of these things. People are actually just upset about the reality of handset subsidies. Well, good. They should be! There are many things wrong with these subsidies.</p>
<p>First, they're a particularly opaque form of consumer credit — you only have to read a few examples of the outrage alluded to above to see that most consumers haven't really internalized how they work. That's never a good thing.</p>
<p>Second, underwriting handsets forces carriers to lock down both customers and their phones in order to recoup the subsidy cost. By necessitating long-term contracts, friction is introduced to the market and competition is hindered. By requiring a hardware architecture that supports locking, carriers can more easily cripple phones' functionality. And since carrier locking reduces the reusability and resalability of handsets, more phones are discarded. It's a terrible set of incentives for consumers: every one or two years you're offered a new electronic gadget at (seemingly) below market cost! And if you choose to take it, your old handset's value is next to nothing, thanks to software restrictions imposed upon it. It's a recipe for electronic waste.</p>
<p>Third, the opacity of the finance mechanism at work helps support bad perceptions about the fair price of mobile data service. It's pretty clear that (given the bandwidth caps and speed limitations in place) mobile broadband has an artificially high price*. Admittedly, that's probably mostly because businesses are the main purchasers of mobile broadband, and they're less price sensitive than consumers. But this situation must be at least somewhat informed by consumers' expectation that any given mobile account will cost $50+ per month. The popularity of the subsidy scheme makes it so that for most cutting edge services, a la carte (or even month to month) service isn't an option at all — you have to enter into a contract even if you already own the device. Speaking as someone who has a bunch of devices and a strong desire to have them all constantly connected, this is pretty inconvenient.</p>
<p>But you know whose fault this is? Yours! Or ours, anyway. This country's consumers have pretty clearly signaled their preference for subsidized handsets, and aren't interested in hearing about the inefficiencies that those subsidies produce. I'm not immensely pleased about this collective decision, but that's the way it's going to be for the foreseeable future. The very least we can do is not whine about the inescapable consequences of this system — coming so soon after an economy-wide consumer credit implosion, these demands for free money (or at least a free extension of existing loans) are a bit much to take.</p>
<p>Incidentally, I do think there's some reason for hope — over the long term, anyway. Wireless standards will eventually converge thanks to the efficiencies of the market and the physical limits on radio bandwidth. Once that happens there'll be no reason to buy a new transceiver every year or two. Presumably there'll be a similar leveling off in demand for these devices' other capabilities, as handset manufacturers start to reach the sort of semi-stable compromise between power consumption, processing muscle and cost that microcomputer processor manufacturers have begun to find in the past few years (add display capability and size to that list for mobile devices, of course). I wouldn't expect it to happen for a decade or so, but eventually we'll start treating our handsets more like the watches they've replaced — as potential heirlooms.</p>
<p>* I can purchase daily unlimited GPRS traffic through Boost Mobile for $0.10. That's a very slow service, but of course costs don't scale evenly with the number of bits transferred. If a profitable unlimited data business can be run at that rate — including advertising, accounting overhead, bandwidth costs and infrastructure — then clearly 2.5/3G services (which typically cannot be purchased on a daily or even monthly basis) are being sold at a phenomenal markup.</p>

                    <p>My <a class="reference external" href="http://www.manifestdensity.net/2009/05/05/python_on_the_fonera/">DD-WRT adventures</a> have come to an end. I spent a long time finding the perfect firmware, cramming Python into it, massaging libraries and... found an immovable roadblock.</p>
<p>Here's the thing: in DD-WRT the serial port — which I intend to use for communication between the Arduino and Fonera — is connected to the Linux console. This makes sense: that port is there as an interface of last resort, but it'w only useful if it's actually connected to something like the shell. Unfortunately, a side effect of this is that all incoming communication triggers system commands — regardless of whether it's from an administrator who's just accidentally screwed up his ethernet port or from a microcontroller trying to politely say hello. Worse, the console hogs the serial port, preventing my Python script from reading from it at all.</p>
<p>This linkage is established when the kernel is invoked. That's not an easy thing to change without recompiling DD-WRT. It <a class="reference external" href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=28104&amp;highlight=stty">can be undone at runtime</a> using a program called setconsole, but that program isn't compiled into the DD-WRT firmware I have — I'd have to recompile to get it. And if I'm going to recompile things, why not just use <a class="reference external" href="http://www.openwrt.org">OpenWRT</a>? It's smaller, easier to build and more customizable. And while DD-WRT and its community is undoubtedly better for most people trying to simply turn their routers into better routers, OWRT's got more people ready to discuss the esoteric router territory where I've found myself. The order of magnitude difference in the projects' respective IRC channel populations is proof enough of that. Sure, in OWRT exotic network configurations may require a bit more wading through documentation and conf files (as opposed to DD-WRT's pleasantly powerful web interface). But that's a small price to pay if the goddamn thing actually <em>works</em>.</p>
<p>So last night I successfully <a class="reference external" href="http://kamikaze.openwrt.org/docs/openwrt.html#x1-390002">built</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://wiki.cuwin.net/index.php?title=Flashing_the_La_Fonera_with_OpenWRT">installed</a> OpenWRT. I had to do it in a <a class="reference external" href="http://virtualbox.wordpress.com/images/">VirtualBox Ubuntu image</a> — building OWRT on OS X is <a class="reference external" href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=318">possible</a> but a bit of a pain. Other than that, it went great. I haven't yet put the install through its python-using paces — I found I'd accidentally left a few packages out on my first pass, so after establishing that SSH worked I set it to recompile and went to bed — but every software component I need (python-mini, setconsole, pyserial, stty, etc.) was right there in the menuconfig build system. Clearly <em>somebody</em> has gotten these things to work in the past — tonight I hope to be next one to accomplish that feat.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>I stayed up way too late last night working on my piece for Artomatic. Playing with electronics can frequently be frustrating — everything goes wrong, then keeps going wrong, and at the end of the night you're left with nothing besides a pile of wasted components and a vague worry about how much lead you've just ingested. Other times, though, everything seems to go right, and that's how it went last night. There's still much more work to be done, but I'm making definite progress.</p>
<p>The piece in question involves a set of <a class="reference external" href="http://images.google.com/images?q=reception%20bell&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Search+Images">reception bells</a> that can be rung through electronic means, and the manual ringing of which can be similarly detected. The first part is done, in a proof-of-conceptish way — I have 12V solenoids installed that can push the clapper into the bell with satisfying vigor — but isn't completely wired up yet, largely because if you run a solenoid incorrectly it'll, er, melt.</p>
<p>The other major task is the detection of a manual ring. I initially thought I'd manage this by electrically isolating the clapper from the dome of the bell, then checking for a completed circuit between them. Ah, the naivete of youth. It turns out that this is a lousy way to make a circuit; worse, it's hard to solder wires onto an anodized bell; worse still, it's <em>really</em> hard to solder to a bell without changing its tone to something unpleasant.</p>
<p>Instead I decided to detect when the clapper breaks an infrared beam. <a class="reference external" href="http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/product_info.php?products_id=241">These things</a> seemed promising due to their physically decoupled nature, but there's no filter to prevent visible light from affecting the photodiode. This might've worked fine inside the darkness of the bell, but it made prototyping a pain.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/product_info.php?products_id=247">These</a> work much better, although the gap between the emitter and detector is juuuust too small to work with the bell's clappers. Bravely ignoring the package's admonishments to avoid breaking open devices made of gallium arsenide, I sawed 'em in half and mounted them with hot glue, and they've been working great ever since.</p>
<p>(Incidentally, I don't think I poisoned myself — the GaAs is only used for the actual semiconducting materials, not the mounting armature, and the package allowed me to see that I would only be cutting plastic if I separated the two halves.)</p>
<p>Here are the fruits of my labor: a creepy video of yours truly showing off an LED blinking in time to the dings of the bell. I still have a minor issue to resolve related to one clapper's tendency to bounce (mechanically, not electrically), but I think I can account for that behavior in software.</p>

<p>Next I'll be prototyping the full bell-strike-detection solution; doing the same for the solenoid; soldering those working circuits onto the breakout/power board; adding active cooling to the case; getting two way serial communication working between the Fonera and Arduino; writing the final software; and then doing the boring, non-electronic stuff: staining, sanding, installation. I've got about a month to get it all done, and right now I'm feeling pretty good about it. But there are certainly still a lot of loose ends.</p>
<p>Speaking of which! Anybody got a pair of bar stools or similarly-sized tables that I can borrow for the month of June?</p>

                    <p>It looks like <a class="reference external" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/8003799.stm">some of the folks behind The Pirate Bay are heading to jail</a>. I'm only a little surprised, and certainly not outraged. The people running TPB have always seemed imprudently defiant, and even though I was glad to see them take technical and political steps to hasten the inevitable (let's get on with it already!), their tendency to argue from positions of transparently bad faith never sat well with me. In the past I'd always shrugged and said that things sure were different in Sweden. Well, not that different, I guess.</p>
<p>The aftermath is proving to be pretty pathetic. Just look at the quotes from those found guilty (&quot;It's so bizarre that we were convicted&quot;); look at the site's <a class="reference external" href="http://thepiratebay.org/special/2009epicwinanyhow.php">&quot;press conference&quot; page</a> (&quot;So, the dice courts judgement is here. It was lol to read and hear, crazy verdict.&quot;). I couldn't bear to watch much of the video, in which some apparent TPB associates natter about Twitter vs. Jaiku and then begin whining about the length of legal documents and how something couldn't possibly be a criminal conspiracy if the participants barely even IM that much.</p>
<p>The gravity of the situation seems to have not yet struck the people involved — either that or Swedish prisons are awfully cushy. The first thing that comes to mind is that <a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Dov9ihrIG8&amp;eurl=http://yourgirlfriend.org/?page_id=94&amp;feature=player_embedded">hipster government</a> video that Jeff found a while back. The second is the quick transition from <a class="reference external" href="http://tehpaine.blogspot.com/2007/10/some-of-you-guys-have-been-asking-for.html">defiance</a> to <a class="reference external" href="http://tehpaine.blogspot.com/2008/02/oinks-bail-extended.html">silence</a> on the blog created in the wake of the arrest of the operator of the Oink Bittorrent tracker. These guys are not yet the martyrs they think they are. But I have a feeling they're going to be.</p>
<p>Of course, the IP industry has been unable to pass up this opportunity to make itself look even more pathetic and ridiculous than the young men who are headed to jail:</p>
<blockquote>
Speaking to the BBC, the chairman of industry body the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) John Kennedy said the verdict sent out a clear message. [...] &quot;There has been a perception that piracy is OK and that the music industry should just have to accept it. This verdict will change that,&quot; he said.</blockquote>
<p>Right. Good luck with that, fellas. The site <a class="reference external" href="http://piratebay.org">isn't even down</a>.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Matt IMs to point out that actually, yes, Swedish prisons are incredibly cushy. He sends <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3261698,00.html">two</a> <a class="reference external" href="http://www.kriminalvarden.se/templates/KVV_InfopageGeneral____4051.aspx">links</a> to prove it, and they're awfully convincing. It seems as though the approach is closer to a halfway house than to a prison as we conceive of it in the US. So hey, maybe the TPB folks do understand the situation. On the other hand, the convicted are also facing a multi-million-dollar penalty. On the other other hand, they've got genuine <a class="reference external" href="http://www.piratpartiet.se/">political support</a>. I still suspect that the TPB operators are going to have a worse time of it than their current behavior implies that they expect, but it doesn't sound like this will ruin anyone's life, and I doubt that the site will go down.</p>
<p><strong>ALSO:</strong> You should probably check out <a class="reference external" href="http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/archives/2009/04/metaphorical_pirates.php">Matt's own post</a> on the matter.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>Since the release of WMATA's GTFS dataset I've been reading up on iPhone application development, and in particular the <a class="reference external" href="http://phonegap.com/">PhoneGap development framework</a>. Traditional iPhone development requires a lot of specialized knowledge and the use of Objective C, a language that's used for Apple development and not much else. It takes a significant investment of time to get up to speed.</p>
<p>PhoneGap helps developers sidestep this hassle by providing a ready-to-build iPhone project that moves development tasks into the more popular world of the web. The iPhone app that results is basically a chromeless browser plus some Javascript bindings to iPhone capabilities that a normal webapp couldn't reach — things like GPS, the accelerometer and data storage. Any hack Javascript jockey (hi!) can get an app running using his or her existing skills. The result probably won't be as silky-smooth as a wholly-native app, but it'll be a lot better than a page pulled across the network and into Mobile Safari. And, crucially, it can be listed in the App Store.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it looks like Apple doesn't like this idea. More and more often the phonegap email list includes cited messages like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Upon review of your application, [APPLICATION NAME] cannot be posted to the App Store due to the usage of private API. Usage of such non-public API, as outlined in the iPhone SDK Agreement section 3.3.2 is prohibited:</div>
<div class="line">&quot;An Application may not itself install or launch other executable code by any means, including without limitation through use of a plug-in architecture, calling other frameworks, other APIs or otherwise. No interpreted code may be downloaded and used in an Application except for code that is interpreted and run by Apple's Published APIs and built-in interpreter(s).&quot;</div>
<div class="line">The PhoneGap API implemented in your application is an external framework.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>So far the other folks on the mailing list suggest doing a search &amp; replace for the word &quot;phonegap&quot; and then resubmitting the app in the hope that the next reviewer will be less of a stickler.</p>
<p>But these rejections may very well reflect a deliberate policy on Apple's part rather than a mere bureaucratic screw-up. The company consistently introduces roadblocks to development, from their stringent interface guidelines to their nasty habit of charging developers for the privilege of popularizing the company's platforms. Right now, for instance, code and documentation that lets devs experiment with the 3.0 iPhone software — which, among other things, puts Google Maps capabilities in the hands of developers — requires a $99 membership in the Apple Developer program. Worse, that membership often takes an unpredictably long time to be processed — sometimes months.</p>
<p>The intent seems to be to raise the bar on development such that only high-quality software from dedicated, skilled individuals makes its way onto Apple products. It's a a coherent strategy, and certainly in keeping with Apple's position as a premium brand. But it's also a serious drag for developers, diminishes the variety and inflates the pricing of the Apple software universe, and generally imposes yet another cost on Apple users in order to maintain the company's elite reputation.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>This morning I read Ezra and Tim Fernholz's 140-char-or-less (clever) discussion about Twitter in the front of the current issue of the Prospect (I don't think the exchange is online). Naturally, I agree with their basic conclusion that everything is terrible and getting worse. But they're primarily interested in the advent of Twitter within the media industry. I'm more concerned with how the media industry is transforming Twitter.</p>
<p>I've been moaning about the mainstream adoption of Twitter for a while now, and simultaneously feeling guilty — or at least hypocritical — for doing so. I really like Twitter! And, knowing one of the guys that works there at least a little, I want to see the company succeed. I really do think they created something cool, original and beautifully simple.</p>
<p>But it's been horrifying to watch Twitter evolve into a medium used for important (if not serious) communication. First and foremost, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.manifestdensity.net/2009/01/20/barack_obama_does_not_want_to/">I am appalled</a> by our legislators' embrace of a time-suck communication medium that is necessarily superficial, and (more perniciously) one that is so convincingly fake-democratic while actually just facilitating communication with rich, Apple-computer-owning white people like myself.</p>
<p>Its adoption by the mainstream media has been similarly off-putting. As a cheap and fun SMS interface for media outlets I have no beef with it; as a means of personal marketing for journalists, the pretense and lack of honesty is dismaying (Ezra's diagnosis of their motivations as being grounded in a desire to avoid being left behind by the next blog-like internet trend is dead-on, I think — we should thank god we were spared from a hypothetical David Gregory Tumblr). I'd say the median journotweet is something like &quot;getting ready to sit down for an i/v w &#64;spalin. the lady is a tough cookie!&quot; when in fact it should be closer to &quot;complaining abt blogs in line to pick up kids &#64; sidwell frnds. no poor people around!&quot;</p>
<p>The medium's been a disaster for some of the better bloggers, too. There are a number of hilarious political writers who've tried to ply their wares in 140 characters or less and in the process ended up making their entire authorial voice sound like a cliche. This is not to say that tweets can't be <a class="reference external" href="http://www.idlewords.com/2009/01/my_year_in_twitter.htm">hilariously funny</a>. But if the medium that made your career is less restrictive, your Twittered communiques may just sound like hacky, &quot;gah!&quot;-filled Jon Stewart imitations. It is an almost unbelievably terrible medium for snark, but no one seems to have noticed.</p>
<p>Curmudgeonly enough for you? I'll happily admit that my bitching about the direction of the D.C. Twitter universe is selfish. It's a service that provided a form of communication I found charming and valuable: repartee with close friends and complete strangers. When the space between those groups began to fill in, things got weird. Tweeted conversations began to have personal — and, most horrifyingly, professional — implications. Soon it'll be time to retreat back to emails and texts among friends until the next early-adopter fad reaches that critical point where it's usefully populated but not yet filled with relatives and people you met at conferences.</p>
<p>But that doesn't mean that the professional-networking and personal-marketing uses of Twitter are invalid. It's just that they're just not what charmed me into using the service, so it makes me sad to see them disappear. This happened to blogs, too, of course, and then Facebook (though I sat that chapter out). At least this time I'm confident that the coming online-fun fallow period won't last forever.</p>

                    <p>Hey! <a class="reference external" href="http://www.wmata.com/rider_tools/developer_resources.cfm">WMATA has finally released it schedule data in a usable format</a>! Except also, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/3378830315/">it hasn't</a>.</p>
<p>I'm sure the 404 will be cleared up soon, but it's secured by a captcha, which makes me a little worried. Throughout this process WMATA was insistent that its schedule data was so vast, complex and ever-changing that it needed to be updated on a daily basis (if not faster!), and that those low-tech hillbillies at Google didn't seem to be up to the task. As you might imagine, I have my doubts about that. But if it's true, they need to provide an interface for downloading the data that can be used without daily human intervention. They may have, in the form of their RSS feed — it points to the same missing URL as the one behind the license agreement. If there's actually no security enforced by the captcha then this'll be fine, although idiotic. If there is, then RSS won't be sufficient. Which of these is the case won't be clear until the data's actually up.</p>
<p>On a personal note, I'm flattered by how many people have been looking in my direction for interesting uses of this new WMATA data. It's my own fault, of course — I've done a bunch of Metro-related projects, and although <a class="reference external" href="http://greatergreaterwashington.org/">GreaterGreaterWashington</a> deserves all the credit for this data release, I did have at least a <a class="reference external" href="/2008/12/16/metro-and-google/">peripheral role</a> in pestering WMATA for GTFS data.</p>
<p>But I should probably start managing expectations now: the most obvious use of the data — a mobile/iPhone app — requires a skillset I haven't got. Not that that'll stop me from trying, but it's likely that someone else will beat me to market and do a better (if not cheaper) job, particularly since this window between the 2.0 and 3.0 iPhone software is a weird time to begin looking at developing map-based applications. On the web side, Google Transit itself will presumably provide a comprehensive solution.</p>
<p>With all that said, I certainly intend to have a look at the data and see if I can do anything neat with it. Either way, the important thing is that regardless of who manages to do it first, riding the bus in DC is about to get a lot easier.</p>

                    <p>My former coworker <a class="reference external" href="http://benbuckman.net/">Ben</a> wrote to me earlier today asking whether I had any particular recommendations for books about electronics and Arduino. I was in a voluble/caffeinated mood, and ended up producing enough text that I figured I might as well throw it on the ol' blog:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">I'd suggest the book <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Practical-Electronics-Inventors-Paul-Scherz/dp/0070580782">Practical Electronics for Inventors</a>. I've heard others speak highly of it, too. When I first read it (and I didn't read all of it) it didn't make a ton of sense. This was slightly disappointing, and all the more so given that others attest to it being one of the most approachable introductions available. But it's proven to be a useful (if at times slightly outdated) reference. And the scene-setting it provides is invaluable. I don't think I've ever actually built a voltage-dividing circuit (though it's a pretty basic thing), and to be honest I don't even find myself using Ohm's Law all that much — shameful, but relatively easy to avoid thanks to the Arduino's robustness and the various online calculators that are available — but these are good things to know. Understanding passive components in terms of hydraulic analogies is extremely helpful, too, at least for me.</div>
<div class="line">On to Arduino. I don't have any books about it, which probably says it all. The online docs are totally sufficient, and it's a much simpler topic in general than electronics. Still, it may be worth picking something up, particularly since Arduino resources are often geared toward programmers learning electronics (many microcontroller resources are set up exactly the other way, which can make them too elementary and too advanced at the same time). There's <a class="reference external" href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596155513/">this introductory book</a>, which I've heard HacDC's Serge Wroclawski describe as an okay Arduino/electronics combo primer for the total novice.</div>
<div class="line">But he also said that it's not advanced enough to really satisfy. For a more sophisticated alternative, I'll note that I've heard good nothing but good things about <a class="reference external" href="http://www.makingthingstalk.com/">Making Things Talk</a>.</div>
<div class="line">I'd also suggest looking at people's projects online. Frequently they're much simpler than you'd expect, because people like myself have muddled through and done things slightly incorrectly, but in ways that fall within the tolerances of the components. This is a good way to start — I built things that were pointless and expensive (transformers w/ bridge rectifiers? what was I thinking?) when I should've just done something simpler, and would have if I knew more about how others had solved the problems I was facing. Sometimes these projects cross into the realm of the dangerously stupid — see <a class="reference external" href="http://cryptonoid.blogspot.com/2007/08/fics-fonera-internet-controlled-switch.html">here</a> — but as long as you stay away from the sorts of voltages coming out of your wall, you should be fine.</div>
<div class="line">Above all, talk to folks who know what they're doing. I'm happy to fill that role to the extent that I can, but I'm almost entirely a fraud. I imagine there's probably a hacker space in your town — that'd be a great place to start. If you have any EE friends, pestering them over beers is a good idea, too. Generally you can find the information you need online, but knowing what terms or topics to search for can be tough. For instance, when I first started thinking about how to sense if a door was closed I only thought of mechanical solutions, not magnetic ones, because I simply hadn't heard of the existence of reed switches and Hall Effect sensors. Or you might want to measure how much a knob is turned and try to do something funky with a potentiometer to do it, instead of searching for details on rotary encoders. Simply having someone mention these to you can be all you need to figure them out for yourself.</div>

                    <p>While the wort was boiling I put together a couple more Boarduino kits that I had hanging around, and tonight I messed around with them a bit more. I already had the breadboard set up with the shift registers and LEDs — not that you can see them, of course (thanks YouTube!).</p>
<p>Tonight I made a pinwheel, then hooked it up to a DC motor and used the combination as a more expensive, less accurate, potentially chip-destroying rotary encoder. It's pretty janky, in other words. But I had this motor on hand (scrounged it from a CDROM), and Radioshack doesn't stock rotary encoders. Besides, some safety checking with the multimeter implies that it'd have to be a <em>very</em> strong wind to fry the chip.</p>

                    <p>As I mentioned, I've been working overtime to hit a deadline — that sort of thing comes up when you suddenly get word that <a class="reference external" href="http://www.npr.org/templates/rundowns/rundown.php?prgId=3">Steve Inskeep</a> is going to start mentioning your URL. Having my laptop suffer a catastrophic logic board failure on Tuesday afternoon didn't help matters.</p>
<p>But we got the site up, and if you're interested in checking it out you can do so at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.subsidyscope.com">subsidyscope.com</a>. You might've already seen the earlier version of the site. This update was to get things beyond the brochureware stage, and to put some actual data online. We were under the gun, and consequently didn't get to do as much as we'd like, or in the way we'd like — witness my ugly inline CSS. But we'll be adding to the site and fixing those problems in the near future.</p>
<p>Thanks to the unexpected end of the American economy, we've shifted gears somewhat and are focusing our early attention on the federal bailout of the financial and automotive sectors rather than examining the even more formidable problem of energy subsidies. Don't worry — we'll still be getting to energy, and transportation, and a bunch of other sectors. But we felt that a project focusing on subsidies couldn't just ignore one of the largest economic interventions of all time.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, data on the bailout is still pretty hard to come by. Despite the congressional complaints you may have heard regarding its transparency, the TARP program is actually the best-characterized part of the bailout of any substantial size — and hey, I made a fancy Javascript visualization thingy for it! But TARP is a relatively small part of the bailout. Part of the problem is that the agencies handing out money haven't released information about what they're doing, either because doing so would violate the privacy of the institutions receiving funds (something that many would call a pretty lame excuse — FOIAs and lawsuits are in process); or simply because they have no idea how much money they've handed out: in a lot of cases the government's promised to cover someone's horrible screw-up, but the bill for the screw-up hasn't yet arrived.</p>
<p>A big part of our job will be to chart and revise the estimates of those costs — and, in particular, to establish how much of the government's payments are subsidies, rather than just market-rate loans being made because everyone else is too scared to lend.</p>
<p>Technically, I've gotten to do a lot of fun stuff. I'm still hopelessly amateurish at Django, but I'm starting to really appreciate Python. Django's pretty handy, too, although I can already see why I've heard others complain about the relatively limited nature of its template system (when unmodified, anyway). I was in a hurry to get the visualizations done — there were a number that got scrapped prior to launch, unfortunately — and settled on <a class="reference external" href="http:/raphaeljs.com">Raphael JS</a> a bit earlier than I should have. As it turns out, its IE performance is not great. But I was mostly pleased with it, and of course jQuery remains very pleasant to work with. I'm working to port the TARP visualization into Flash anyway, though (via the Flex framework) — IE's performance is just too lousy to stick with Javascript.</p>

It's pretty pathetic; I should really just buy one. Thing is, when they first went on sale I thought I'd be going on the strength of EchoDitto's allotment of sponsor tickets. These days I don't use Drupal on a day to day basis, and it would be hard for me to justify attending the convention for more than a panel or two — not when I could be working. Given that, even though the organizers (<a class="reference external" href="http://developmentseed.org/">hi guys</a>!) have done a great job of keeping the price down, $250 is a bit steep for a couple of hours' instruction in technologies that aren't immediately useful to me.</p>
<p>Hence the swathing in swag. One way or another I'll be participating in the festivities — so far as I know, convention badges won't be required for hanging out at bars at the end of each day. But I'm not sure I'll actually be at the panels.</p>

                    <p>Julian, reacting to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2008/11/03/mccain_calls/index.html">Angela's new piece in Salon about phonebanking for the McCain campaign</a>, voices <a class="reference external" href="http://www.juliansanchez.com/2008/11/03/open-source-dirty-tricks/">some concern</a> over the candidates' phonebank-from-home systems and their potential value to dirty tricksters.</p>
<p>I'm not as worried. As Julian notes, Angela had a hard time getting people on the phone at all, to say nothing of actually speaking to them. It's hard to imagine an individual doing more damage to democracy this way than they could through more traditional means like printing up some misleading flyers or saying awfully cleverly awful things to people approaching their polling places.</p>
<p>I suppose you could argue that the anonymity of the phone might make the tactic more appealing. But remember: the campaign running the system will have a record of which volunteer called whom. Depending on the system, they may even keep recordings. Judging by the manic zeal with which I saw the chairperson of the Ashburn Obama office encouraged volunteers to find a recording of a fraudulent area robocall, I suspect that any villainous phonebankers would be caught pretty quickly.</p>
<p>I think that hobbyists capable of using technology to amplify their malfeasance remain the larger threat — it's pretty easy to write a script that spreads orders of magnitude more misinformation per hour than a human being can. Which brings me, finally, to the thinly-veiled reason for this post: to link again to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.manifestdensity.net/2006/11/07/part_man_part_machine_all_dise/">my recipe for robocalling</a>. It's just as easy now as it was two years ago — if anything, it's probably cheaper.</p>
<p>One thing I will add, though: Thanks to <a class="reference external" href="http://freedom-to-tinker.com/user/tblee">Tim</a>, I recently had a chance to chat with <a class="reference external" href="http://www.dubfire.net/boarding_pass/">Chris Soghoian</a> and, over beers outside at Townhouse, we found ourselves describing nearly identical blueprints for voter suppression (Chris's was better in that his involved shady Russian ISPs — more bandwidth <em>and</em> more villainous menace than my podunk coffeeshop scenario/stolen wifi scenario). If the two of us both came up with the same plan, it's a safe bet that some other geeks have, too. It seems likely that at least a few of them will have a go at it.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what to do about this, exactly. Resisting the urge to relax restrictions on institutional calls to mobile phones is probably a good start — not that it'll stop crooks, but it will make the idea of getting a campaign-related call on your mobile a bit more discordant and surprising. It also seems like we could probably spend some government dollars every four years on a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.dtvtransition.org/">DTV-transition</a>-style ad campaign hyping a unified federal election information website. And it might not be a bad idea to provide some <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nudges.org/thebook.cfm">Nudge-inspired</a> opt-out election reminders via phone or email on election day. &quot;Check this form on your tax return if you would prefer not to be reminded to vote on election day&quot; — that sort of thing.</p>
<p>Whatever we do, it'll be more a question of education than enforcement: catching malefactors is probably hopeless. People like <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/03/magazine/03trolls-t.html">this</a> will continue to exist, and their powers will continue to grow. But if a voter is given two conflicting sources of information, hopefully they'll at least be confused enough to seek a third.</p>
<p><strong>INCIDENTALLY:</strong> Julian's <a class="reference external" href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20081021-net-yields-new-dirty-political-tricks-means-to-fight-them.html">article</a> about online dirty tricks offers a number of interesting possibilities. I'll just add that the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/understanding-kaminskys-dns-bug">Kaminsky DNS bug</a> would have been a <em>totally awesome</em> way of executing BOE-website-spoofing scams. I can't find any up-to-date numbers on the deployment of the patch, but at this point it's got to be complete enough that such an attack would be a very low-percentage play.</p>

                    <p>Another day, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.playlist.com/">another music-sharing flash widget that uses RC4 to encrypt its MP3 URLs but keeps the key in the SWF</a>.</p>
<p>I realize I've never made good on <a class="reference external" href="http://www.manifestdensity.net/2008/03/28/surprisingly_i_dont_consider_m/">my promise to explain how I would build a secure Flash music player</a>. Partly I forgot; partly it's just that it's an impossible problem, and proposing incremental improvements to the situation isn't very satisfying.</p>
<p>But look, you can at least half-ass it. Right now if someone gets a hold of the MP3 URL the jig is up — they can repost it anywhere else and help themselves to your bandwidth. You can improve on this situation, at least, by serving a dynamic playlist filled with URLs that are only good for the current user. Either throw each URL away after one use (admittedly problematic for repeating a song without additional trips to the playlist server); or, better yet, find the song by hashing its unique identifier together with the user's IP and user agent (again, in the dynamic playlist generation script). You don't have to move any files around, you just have to write a script that looks up the requested hash in the database and then pipes out the MP3 from its secret location. There's no need for encryption, even. Season with additional querystring parameters and column indices to taste.</p>
<p>&quot;But Tom!&quot; you cry, &quot;Can't an enterprising jerk like yourself then write a script that reverse-engineers this process and automatically creates URLs that are compatible with their use agent/IP combination?&quot; Well, yes — although the salting algorithm (and song identifier, potentially) will remain secret, so you're going to need a rainbow table, which usually costs money. But also no, because you made a note in your database when the browser talked to the playlist server. So strangers can't come in — they have to have at least asked for that playlist first.</p>
<p>Of course, if they went after the MP3 they would done so have, anyway. So yes, securing the file against individuals is still hopeless — I hope I never implied otherwise. But at least reposting or emailing the link won't get them anywhere.</p>
<p>The downside to all of this is that you're going to have to stop using a big dumb CDN. But look, it's just not that hard to stand up a dead-simple EC2 LAMP instance to serve your playlist creation script and pipe stuff out of S3. <a class="reference external" href="http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/entry.jspa?externalID=609">Elasticfox</a>, people.</p>
<p>Oh, and one other thing: for god's sake, ban jackasses like me the first time you see a naked curl user-agent string. I never remember that -A flag until I absolutely have to.</p>

                    <p>If you're anything like me you really don't appreciate the games that your television service providers play with you. It would be nice, for instance, if Comcast didn't <a class="reference external" href="http://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/showthread.php?t=1008271">compress its programming to within an inch of its life</a>. It's a lousy way to treat your customers.</p>
<p>But even more grating is various broadcasters' habit of jacking the volume way, WAY UP whenever a program goes to commercial. For a while I dismissed this as the sort of paranoid anti-corporate rambling that I enjoy indulging in but only sort of believe. But at this point the effect really can't be denied: if I'm watching a live broadcast I almost always have to turn down the volume when it breaks for commercial.</p>
<p>It sure would be nice if we could make them stop these hijinks, and in fact there's some proposed legislation that aims to do exactly that. As you might expect, the guys over at the <a class="reference external" href="http://techliberation.com/2008/10/21/loud-tv-ads-no-need-for-regulation/">Tech Liberation Front think it's outrageous that anyone would try such a thing</a> — markets(!), etc. Most recently they've been quoting AV columnist Ken Pohlmann, who has a similar perspective but has different motivations: he's worried about Congress accidentally messing with his audio quality. And he thinks there are easier solutions, anyway:</p>

At the broadcast and distribution end, as part of the ATSC standard, Dolby Digital has built-in loudness-normalization parameters. Using these protocols, any receiving decoder will recognize the metadata and adjust the sound to proper levels. All Dolby audio signals are controlled by these parameters; when used properly, they ensure consistent levels across one channel and between many channels. True, some engineers and producers arenâ€™t setting the metadata properly, but thatâ€™s a simple matter of education and experience.</blockquote>
<p>It's sweet that he thinks this is just a big misunderstanding — a few audio engineers who are tryin' awful hard, but still learning their craft. My perspective is a bit more cynical. Anyway here's Adam Thierer, the author of the TLF posts:</p>
<blockquote>
As I pointed out in my essay on this, the thought of FCC bureaucrats sitting around squandering their time and taxpayer money on this nonsense is really appalling, and I canâ€™t wait to see the reams of paperwork they would spit out when they have to open an proceeding about how â€œexcessively noisy or stridentâ€? ads will be defined, measured, and then penalized.</blockquote>
<p>I remain unconvinced by these arguments. The <a class="reference external" href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=110_cong_bills&amp;docid=f:h6209ih.txt.pdf">CALM Act (PDF)</a> doesn't specify what the penalty for violation of its admittedly vaguely-worded volume requirements would be — presumably that and other details would be up to the FCC to decide. So it's hard to say how good this specific regulatory proposal would turn out to be.</p>
<p>But even if this specific attempt ultimately falls short, there's nothing incoherent or impossible about the basic idea of telling broadcasters not to blast their ads at us. Nobody is saying that enforcement has to be undertaken at great government expense, or that such a regulation would have to apply to anything other than commercial messages. All you'd have to do is say that channels may only broadcast commercials at a volume X% greater than the average volume of their noncommercial programming (as the CALM Act basically does), and that citizens who receive programming that is consistently in violation of that regulation are entitled to collect civil damages not to exceed $Y per documented instance. There: no need for government monitoring; no interference with the audio fidelity of non-ads; no incentive for &quot;gotcha!&quot; enforcement of single technical mistakes; but a credible threat of class-action suits that would almost certainly dissuade broadcasters from playing these petty games with their customers.</p>
<p>It's not rocket science, and it's not unreasonable. I understand that TLF's knee-jerk response is to oppose any regulation whatsoever, especially if it's coming from the FCC. But Thierer's favored solution — having everyone buy audio-normalizing hardware — seems considerably more ridiculous to me than asking the FCC to say &quot;knock it off!&quot;</p>

                    <p><img alt="image1" class="right" src="/static/2008/10/23/20081022_ultimateironman-20081022-141238.jpg" />For a while now I've been trying to convince Charles that he ought to jailbreak his iPhone. I'm not sure why I feel compelled to do so, exactly, and the reasons that might motivate Charles to take my advice have been even murkier. Getting a free terminal app is reason enough for me, and running Bittorrent off my phone has a certain novelty. But these days most users' needs are pretty well taken care of by the App Store.</p>
<p>Well, I've got a better justification now: comics. As you might imagine, there's a robust trade in pirate scans of comics on the Bittorrent tracker sites. It's easy to partake, and, for me at least, a fairly guilt-free experience: downloading back issues has propelled me to dramatically increase my actual comic purchases. For instance, I'd been a little curious about Hellboy when I first heard of the series. But after downloading the complete run, I find myself buying every new BPRD TPB the moment it's in stores (and slowly but surely picking up physical copies of the older books that I'd first read electronically). In my case, at least, the net effect is clear: comic piracy has allowed the industry to extract much more money from me than it otherwise would have.</p>
<p>We're still a ways off from digital comics competing with their physical counterparts — much further than for books, I'd say. But it's still nice to be able to catch up on storylines that you'd otherwise only hear about on Wikipedia (or text boxes signed &quot;–&nbsp;ED&quot;). And having a huge collection of idle reading on your phone is pretty great. It's hard to make myself suffer through an ebook on a tiny screen, but for some reason the prospect of a comic seems more appealing.</p>
<p>The iPhone turns out to be surprisingly well-suited to the task, too. I won't claim that it isn't a little tough on the ol' eyeballs, but the resolution of the screen makes it <em>just</em> possible to read issues in landscape mode without zooming. And of course you can always do the normal pinch-to-zoom operation that's offered by mobile Safari.</p>
<p>Enough evangelizing: how do you do this?</p>
<p><strong>1. Unlock your phone.</strong></p>
<p>These days, it's simple. You'll probably want to use QuickPwn, which is available in <a class="reference external" href="http://blog.iphone-dev.org/post/50888951/redmond-we-have-a-pwnapple">Windows</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://blog.iphone-dev.org/post/49988701/pwnagetool-and-quickpwn-for-2-1-firmware">Mac</a> flavors. Just launch the utility; it'll walk you through the procedure.</p>
<p>Once you've jailbroken, you'll notice a few changes on your iPhone. For one thing, the startup graphic will be a pineapple instead of an apple. For another, there'll be a new application called Cydia — it's got a brown icon. This is one of the programs used to install software on jailbroken iPhones. Run it; download whatever updates it wants to install; then install the following packages:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>OpenSSH</li>
<li>Toggle SSH</li>
<li>iComic</li>
</ul>
<p>The first package installs SSH, the lingua franca of secure inter-machine communication. It's a behind-the-scenes sort of thing. The second package makes it easy for you to turn SSH access to your phone on and off — important for both security and battery reasons. The third is the actual comic-reading program. If you'd like, you can install the program called ComicViewer, too — it's by the same author, and, aside from some UI differences, virtually identical. I haven't found much reason to favor it over iComic, though, and it's easier to distinguish books with long filenames under iComic. Both are flaky in various ways, so it's probably worthwhile to occasionally check back for upgrades and figure out which one you prefer.</p>
<p><strong>2. Get Some Comics</strong></p>
<p>This is also easy. You just need to visit <a class="reference external" href="http://isohunt.com/">IsoHunt</a> or <a class="reference external" href="http://thepiratebay.org/browse/602">TPB</a> and find some comics. Keep an eye out for multi-packs — frequently a lot of issues are bundled together into large files centered around a theme — say, Dark Horse's output for a given month, the complete collected works of Alan Moore, or all of a crossover event like Civil War. Sometimes it'll be a cross-house monthly update. Just browse around, taking time to note the lists of files available by clicking through to each individual torrent's file description page.</p>
<p>Then download. On OS X you'll want to use <a class="reference external" href="http://www.transmissionbt.com/">Transmission</a>, I think. On Windows folks seem to like <a class="reference external" href="http://www.utorrent.com/download.php">ÂµTorrent</a>.</p>
<p><strong>3. If Necessary, Convert Your Comics</strong></p>
<p>Comics are generally distributed as CBR or CBZ files. It's interesting, actually — no, really. These are extremely simple formats — ad-hoc standards arrived at by groups of people who have more patience for tedious scanning than they do elite technical expertise. The formats are just zip or rar files, basically — that's why one ends in z and the other in r (sometimes you'll see them with .zip or .rar extensions instead of the CBR or CBZ convention — it's the same thing). Inside each archive is a bunch of JPEG files, the names of which determine the order in which they'll be displayed. It's a simple standard built on existing, open formats. A little metadata might be nice, but that could be easily solved by including an XML or YAML file in the archive. Anyway, let's not get ahead of ourselves.</p>
<p>Both of these formats are easily read by desktop software like <a class="reference external" href="http://jomic.sourceforge.net/">Jomic</a>. iComic and ComicViewer can only handle CBZs, though, so if you end up with CBRs — and you probably will — you'll need to convert them. This is pretty easy to do manually: download <a class="reference external" href="http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm">WinRAR</a> (Windows) or <a class="reference external" href="http://www.unrarx.com/">UnRarX</a> (Mac), uncompress the file, then compress its contents back into a zip. Simple.</p>
<p>If you'd like to automate the process and aren't afraid of the command line, here's a little Ruby script that'll automatically convert your CBRs. This could probably be done with a single clever line of bash scripting, but hey, this is easier to figure out. It should work right away on OS X if you install UnRarX to your Applications folder. If the unrar executable lives elsewhere, though, you'll have to edit the variables at the top. Also, there's a line near the bottom that you can uncomment if you'd like to delete the source CBRs when you're done with them. I don't trust my script enough to use it before seeing how its handiwork turns out, though.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="literal-block">
#!/usr/bin/ruby
require 'Time'
# change this to point at a command line unrar utility, if necessary
UNRAR = '/Applications/UnRarX.app/Contents/Resources/unrar'
# same thing here
ZIP = '/usr/bin/zip'
while (path = STDIN.gets)
exit if (path==nil)
path.strip!
new_filename = path.sub(/cbr$/i,'cbz')
working_dir = ('/tmp/' + Time.now.to_i.to_s)
`mkdir #{working_dir}`
`#{UNRAR} e &quot;#{path}&quot; #{working_dir}`
`#{ZIP} &quot;#{new_filename}&quot; #{working_dir}/*`
`rm -rf #{working_dir}`
# uncomment the following line to automatically delete your old CBRs
#`rm -f &quot;#{path}&quot;`
end
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>You invoke the script like this (assuming you're in the top-level directory housing the comics that need to be converted):</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="literal-block">
find . -type f -name &quot;*.cbr&quot; | ruby /path/to/cbzify.rb
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>If you're on Windows you probably shouldn't bother with all this. There are some PC-based conversion options discussed in <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ipodtouchfans.com/forums/showthread.php?t=23759">this thread</a>. I'm afraid I don't have any first-hand experience with them, though.</p>
<p><strong>4. Copy the files to your phone</strong></p>
<p>Alright. Time to actually move the files over. First things first: make sure your phone and computer are on the same wifi network. Then head into the iPhone's settings screen. Under &quot;General&quot;, temporarily turn off the Auto-lock feature. Now go into your wifi settings, to the network selection screen, and hit the blue arrow next to the name of the network you're on. Scroll down and find the phone's current IP address. Write it down.</p>
<p>Okay, now head back to the home screen. Find the &quot;Toggle SSH&quot; application, launch it, and turn SSH on. You can then exit back to the home screen — SSH will remain enabled until you come back here and disable it. Any open SSH connections will break whenever the phone goes to sleep, though, which is why we turned off Auto-lock.</p>
<p>We're going to need to do two things, both over SSH. The first is to create a directory called /var/mobile/Media/Comic. The second is to copy the comic files into that directory (or subfolders under it). If you're on windows, both of these tasks can be accomplished using <a class="reference external" href="http://winscp.net/eng/index.php">WinSCP</a>. The address of the phone is the IP you wrote down earlier. The login is &quot;root&quot;. The password is &quot;alpine&quot; (yes, on all iPhones — this is why you should turn off SSH when we're done).</p>
<p>On a Mac we already have the software necessary to do the copying. Open up an instance of Terminal and do the following, substituting your phone's appropriate IP address, typing out &quot;yes&quot;, and entering the password &quot;alpine&quot; when prompted:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ ssh root&#64;192.168.0.xxx
The authenticity of host '192.168.0.xxx (192.168.0.xxx)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is ab:cd:ef:12:34:56:78:90:ab:cd:ef:12:34:56:78:90.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
Warning: Permanently added '192.168.0.xxx' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.
root&#64;192.168.0.xxx's password:
localhost:~ root# mkdir /var/mobile/Media/Comic
localhost:~ root# logout
Connection to 192.168.0.xxx closed.
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Then just use the rsync utility to copy over the files. Again, from the directory with the comics in it:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="literal-block">
rsync -v -r --exclude=*.cbr . root&#64;192.168.0.xxx:/var/mobile/Media/Comic/
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>This may take a while. But once it's done, you just have to launch iComic and everything should be there. Disable SSH, turn Auto-lock back on, delete the source files — you're all set. Actual navigation through the comics is done by tapping the lower right or left corner of the screen. Returning to the main menu is accomplished by tapping the upper left corner. Be patient — it takes a second or two to turn pages.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.ipodtouchfans.com/forums/showthread.php?t=23759">Lots more information about iComic can be found in this thread</a>. Enjoy!</p>

<p>It's called an IEC plug, and it's the same type of connector that goes into most desktop PCs. The only trick here is that this is a male connector, not the incredibly-easy-to-find female version. It's simple enough to order one, but I'd feel stupid paying $7 shipping on an item that costs $1.50.</p>
<p>If you've got one lying around, perhaps connected to some ancient piece of unused equipment, let me know. Yes, I will be destroying it. But I can undestroy it afterward!

<p>I'll just add that the situation is very similar to the one that's faced the console modchip industry for years. Modchips, which alter the behavior of videogame consoles, are typically sold with a firmware that only makes legal functionality possible — running Linux on the unit, that sort of thing. The vast majority, though, are then reflashed by their owners with custom firmwares that enable piracy and other illegal operations. Because it's much easier to distribute illegal software without getting caught than it is to distribute illegal physical objects, this provides a sneaky way of shipping around proscribed devices. The DMCA is in part an attempt to fight this tactic, but it necessarily gets into the murky area surrounding what an object — one that has some legitimate uses — is <em>intended</em> to do.</p>
<p>The problem's likely to get worse, incidentally. A consequence of ever-improving chip performance and ever-falling prices is that more and more device logic is placed into programmable memory rather than dedicated circuits. This confers some real benefits — it makes it easier to design the devices, for one thing, and to fix them if a bug is found. But it's relatively easy to rewrite or override that logic.</p>
<p>It's all pretty interesting, I think, particularly when viewed as a blurring of the lines between the physical and virtual worlds. The net's ability to facilitate the distribution of forbidden information is well-known; this is a case where one could say that forbidden <em>objects</em> are being transmitted. The animating spirits of the devices — the essential things that make them forbidden — have been abstracted from their physical substrates, and consequently can move around with all the speed, anonymity and reproducibility that the net has to offer.</p>

<p>It probably doesn't matter too much either way. The case is the least environmentally problematic part of the computer.

<p>Not bad, right? And that's resized and compressed to a lossy jpeg. Take my word for it: the original looks fantastic.</p>
<p>It turns out that <a class="reference external" href="http://tivodecode.sourceforge.net/">tivodecode</a> is near-miraculous (the GUIs for it... less so). If you've got a recent-model Tivo you can visit its https interface, download the stored .tivo files and convert them to mpeg, easy as you please. Of course, the files are pretty big — several gigs for HD recordings — and I haven't currently got a machine on my network beefy and idle enough to transcode up iphone-ready files on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Still: pretty neat. It's nice to know that I've got a very high quality capture box sitting under my TV if I ever decide I badly need to put some televised video online. And it's just <em>fun</em>. Do any progressive media watchdogs want to pay me to help them create automated, annotated archives of cable news? Because with this gadgetry we could totally do it on the cheap.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>Around work I'm known as something of a Movable Type apologist. I can't help it — it's how I was raised. MT was the first thing I tried to install <a class="reference external" href="http://www.zunta.org/blog/archives/2002/08/28/narcissism_what/">six years ago</a> when I decided to check out the burgeoning blogging phenomenon, back when the media was merely interested in, rather than terrified of, the whole business.</p>
<p>Movable Type's greatest strength is handling traffic, which of course is not something I've ever really needed it for. When you make a change to a site MT picks up all the data you've entered, passes it through your templates and generates a plain ol' HTML file, which it then plops in the appropriate directory. It also updates a few other files, like your site's main page. But these are similarly static (by &quot;static&quot; I mean a page that doesn't ask the server to do any computation as it's served). As you might imagine, serving static pages is a relatively easy task for a webserver — all the computational cost of composing a page is incurred once, when it's created, and the result is saved. The overhead for each subsequent page-serving is consequently as small as it can be. This is what makes MT good at dealing with traffic.</p>
<p>But the system that does this is built on unappealingly old, slow technology. And besides, there are good reasons for wanting dynamic functionality on a page. You can create a hybrid sort of site — this blog is an example, as it uses a lot of PHP in its MT templates — but it's a little awkward to build and maintain. You can extend the core MT system, too, but it's not always well-suited to the task. Over the past few years I've watched as the folks at Gothamist, with the help of <a class="reference external" href="http://apperceptive.com/">Apperceptive</a>, have done this time and again, cajoling MT into accomplishing things that it really has no interest in doing. Sometimes I've been frustrated by this process; other times I've been impressed. Either way, their efforts can be fairly described as heroic. But if they were using a different platform there wouldn't be a need for quite as much heroism. I suspect this wouldn't be a bad thing.</p>
<p>Now <a class="reference external" href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20080813-movable-type-pro-to-meld-blogging-and-social-networking.html">Ars</a>, acting uncharacteristically like a press release proxy, brings word of MT 4.2 Pro. Despite the enthusiastic writeup, the announcement leaves me about ready to call it a day on MT. Not that I'll stop using it, mind you — porting this blog would be a pain — but it's clear that its time is done. Six Apart is already retreating from the stab at openness that they made with MT4. And the warmed-over social networking features that they're now offering feel just a bit desperate. There is nothing here that can't be easily accomplished with <a class="reference external" href="http://mu.wordpress.org/about">Wordpress MU</a> or <a class="reference external" href="http://drupal.org">Drupal</a>.</p>
<p>And that's alright. I'm glad to see those other (free) projects ascendant: Wordpress has managed to harness its community's enthusiasm for writing some of the world's worst PHP code and turned it into a successful, professional product that's actually well-engineered (if subject to more security bulletins than I'd like to see). With the caching technologies it has available, there's no longer a great reason for using MT.</p>
<p>And Drupal — well, I spend so much time with Drupal that my feelings are inevitably mixed. But I'd take it any day over Movable Type (and Wordpress, for that matter).</p>
<p>I'm glad to keep a hand in MT. It's a very different system than those other blogging platforms, and that's probably good for me. But it's no longer possible to make a great case on its behalf. The only thing it has going for it is the company behind it: if you buy a commercial license you can call up Six Apart and yell at them in a way that isn't possible with non-corporate projects. That's certainly enough to build a business on — ask Redhat. But in terms of total yelling <em>period</em>, I'm ready to concede defeat on behalf of MT proponents everywhere.</p>

<blockquote>
The custom-rolled firmware from the US cellphone companies is also, of course, likely to tell fibs about signal strength. The telephony companies quickly realised that it's much cheaper to sell phones that show lots of signal all the time than to actually bother putting up more of those expensive cell towers. And, once again, the signal strength is not the same as the call quality. Lots of signal plus lots of noise is not as good as a little bit of signal plus almost no noise at all.</blockquote>

<p>Curiously, <a class="reference external" href="http://uncov.com">uncov.com</a> redirects to <a class="reference external" href="http://pressflip.com">pressflip.com</a>.

<p>Interesting: the author of the HackMii blog has <a class="reference external" href="http://hackmii.com/2008/07/dear-nintendo/">posted an entry</a> requesting that Nintendo get in touch with him about an exploit he's discovered that would allow piracy of Wii games without modification to the console. He notes that he's tried emailing Nintendo but hasn't received a response. Then he indicates that he's planning to follow the disclosure methodology outlined <a class="reference external" href="http://www.wiretrip.net/rfp/policy.html">here</a>. Key parts:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">A. [...T]he ORIGINATOR is to email the MAINTAINER about the problem.</div>
<div class="line">B. The MAINTAINER has 5 work days respond. [...] The ORIGINATOR is technically free to do whatever they want to do after 5 work days—however, they should be fair and wait if the MAINTAINER shows adequate initiative to fix the ISSUE.</div>
<div class="line">[C, D, E and F concern the procedure followed if the MAINTAINER acknowledges the communication and works to resolve the issue]</div>
<div class="line">G. If the MAINTAINER feels it's appropriate to alert the public of the issue, then there's no reason why the ORIGINATOR should not. Traditionally, alerting the community of a problem (but not providing full exploit details) has proven to be futile; other researchers are then just as likely to discover the problem as well—and they may not bide by the guidelines set by this policy. Therefore, if the issue is to be disclosed, all aspects of it should be disclosed.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>In short, if Nintendo chooses not to respond, there may be piracy-enabling exploit code for the Wii published in as little as five days. This is a real possibility: Nintendo's historical reaction to issues raised by the hacking community has been to ignore it and hope it goes away. There don't appear to be nearly as many institutional resources devoted to mitigating these issues as at Sony and Microsoft — that's apparent from their consoles' relatively simple security systems, the slow and somewhat half-assed manner in which the Twilight Hack was ultimately patched, and the lack of attention paid to piracy on their handheld consoles relative to, say, the PSP's constantly-updated firmware.</p>
<p>A lack of attention shouldn't be confused with a lack of calculation, however: Nintendo might be right to ignore these issues. The Wii's success owes to its adoption among a new demographic — one that's not traditionally associated with gaming, and one that can probably be counted on not to do much damage to Nintendo's bottom line by burning patched ISOs from the Pirate Bay.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Nintendo has responded through private channels, and consequently it looks like the exploit won't be released until after a patch is issued. It's still entertaining to check out the comments at the linked post, though, which are full of morons impersonating Nintendo representatives in order to get the exploit sent to them. A hint for these overconfident confidence men: most major corporations don't ask to use IRC to discuss trade secrets.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p><a class="reference external" href="http://grammarpolice.net">Kriston</a> sent me <a class="reference external" href="http://www.economist.com/displayStory.cfm?source=hptextfeature&amp;story_id=11699909">this link</a> earlier this week, which discusses using water to cool our ever-hotter computer processors. It's an interesting read, particularly the part about using waste heat from datacenters for cogenerative heating.</p>
<p>But the ins and outs of the CPU heat problem are actually even moreinteresting than the article implies. So interesting, in fact, that I think I'll blather on about them for a bit.</p>
<p>First: this isn't a new problem. As we cram more transistors onto chips every electrical component gets smaller and noisier, and we have to crank the voltage up to be able to hear the signal. That produces more heat. As we increase processor clock speeds the heat-generating operation of all those tiny switches happens more frequently, too, which also produces more heat.</p>
<p>This is a pretty well-known problem in hobbyist circles, where overclocking — running your CPU at a faster speed than it's designed for — is a popular way to eke out more bang per buck. Doing so also produces a lot of extra heat, which these days translates into the CPU shutting itself down rather dramatically once it reaches the danger zone (earlier chips dealt with overheating in considerably more expensive ways).</p>
<p>In overclocking circles exotic cooling solutions are pretty common, whether in the form of beefed up fans, Peltier coolers or water. A normal CPU cools itself with a fan that uses air to wick heat away from a radiator-like block of aluminum, which is strapped tightly to the CPU with just a tiny smear of thermally conductive grease between 'em. But air is much less efficient at transmitting heat than the same volume of liquid, so if you're pushing the envelope it may make sense to shuttle energy around with liquid.</p>
<p>This isn't a particularly exotic technology any more — Dell was <a class="reference external" href="http://www.hothardware.com/articles/Dell_XPS_710_H2C_Performance_Gaming_System/">shipping water-cooled gaming systems over a year ago</a>. But it's still unlikely to enter the mainstream. As you might imagine, the potential for disastrous failure is much higher than with a fan. And there are other inconveniences — if you don't use the right chemicals you might find your PC clogged with algae.</p>
<p>An amusing alternative exists: use a nonconductive fluid and simply submerge the whole system. Like, say, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/strip-fans,1203.html">cooking oil</a>. Dump your PC's guts in a tub, cover with oil and overclock away! As you might imagine, there are some downsides. First, atmospheric water may foul the oil and perhaps even collect in small patches sufficient to cause a short. Second, anything with moving parts — hard drives, for example — will need to be kept safely unsubmerged. Third, various compounds in your machine's electronics, like cable insulation, may slowly dissolve in a nonpolar solvent like oil. Fourth, you'll still need to circulate the oil if you want it to properly exchange heat. Fifth, and most importantly: it's going to be really messy and gross. Seriously, don't pour oil on your PC.</p>
<p>But there are other technologies being used to mitigate heat problems. One of them — admittedly, kind of a boring one — is the general trend toward multiprocessor computing. This is being undertaken primarily for other reasons, but a pleasant consequence of greater parallelism will be an ability to avoid some heat problems.</p>
<p>A somewhat more speculative (but still plausible) idea is to escape silicon and its heat limits by finding another semiconductor substrate material. Diamond is the one most often bandied about, as <a class="reference external" href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.09/diamond_pr.html">in this Wired article</a>. It's a pretty neat idea, although so far as I know nobody's yet trying to build such a processor outside of a research lab.</p>
<p>The coolest, most semi-magical solution to the heat problem is <a class="reference external" href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2003/11/14/reversible_computing_is_the_only/">reversible computing</a>. I can't claim to be an expert, but the basic idea goes like this: if you keep track of every step of a computational process in such a way that, after arriving at your answer, you can run them all <em>backward</em>, the final result will be a much less entropically disordered state than a traditional processor would have arrived at. A result is that much less of your input energy is converted into heat.</p>
<p>I know: it sounds kind of ridiculous, as though we're expecting our mathematical doodlings to bend reality in a completely implausible way. There must be some obscured practical gotcha hiding beneath the theory, ready to spoil our cool-computing aims in the same way that every magnet-based free energy machine fails to live up to its imagined performance. But the idea's been around for decades, and not in fringe circles. It's just that it's a sufficiently advanced technology, indistinguishable from... well, you know.</p>

But the iPhone 2 experience is not for me. It's the price: I could be wrong, but my understanding is that, as a current iPhone owner who's already sold AT&amp;T his soul, I'd be paying <a class="reference external" href="http://www.tuaw.com/2008/07/08/why-you-shouldnt-buy-the-iphone-3g-on-friday/">$400 more</a> than the advertised, subsidized price. That's too much for 3G and a GPS receiver that's apparently incapable of TomTom-style realtime tracking.</p>
<p>In fact, I'm not even upgrading to the iPhone 2 software — not yet, anyway. I'd love to have a blogging client and NetNewsWire (which would sync my unread items). But I'm not quite ready to abandon my jailbroken apps. <a class="reference external" href="http://www.iphonehacks.com/2008/04/twitter-twinkle.html">Twinkle</a>'s a great Twitter client already — I don't need Twitterific. <a class="reference external" href="http://justanotheriphoneblog.com/wordpress/2008/04/19/lexitron-new-text-twist-like-game-for-iphone/">Lexitron</a> is a fantastic game, and certainly more appealing to me than Monkey Ball.

                    <p>This is a few months old, but I've just now discovered it. And it's impossibly cool: <a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/p/tivoremote/">controlling your Tivo from your iPhone</a>.</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://code.google.com/p/tivoremote/"><img alt="image1" class="center" src="/static/2008/07/09/skitched-20080709-110811.jpg" /></a></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.tivocommunity.com/tivo-vb/showthread.php?t=392385">Apparently</a> there's a telnet port open on newer Tivos that allows you to issue remote control commands over a local network. Someone's taken that functionality and wrapped it in an iPhone app, which can be installed on any jailbroken unit.</p>
<p>It's totally pointless, of course — aside from saving me a ten-foot trip when I find myself in the kitchen without the remote I can't imagine a use for it — but it's really, really neat.</p>
<p>It's also a little unsettling. I didn't have to provide any configuration; the thing just knew where to find my Tivo. And while you can't view a list of recorded programs without entering the Tivo's individual media key, it's easy to imagine some entertaining wardriving pranks that wouldn't need the key. It would be relatively trivial, for instance, to write a script that automatically deletes everyone's recorded programs, or that sets any Tivos it finds to fill up with racy content. If you set your laptop on the passenger seat and drove around the city for an evening I bet you could find at least a few dozen vulnerable machines.</p>

                    <p>Megan <a class="reference external" href="http://meganmcardle.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/06/fit.php">asks a question</a> that I can actually answer!</p>
<blockquote>
I am very interested to know why Nintendo ramps up these launches so slowly. The Wii has been an astoundingly successful product, but it took over a year for them to get enough to market to get the standard price down to the MSRP. Now the Fit seems to be following the same trend. I would have thought that this was exactly the sort of thing they were trying to avoid--making women feel as if they were running after a children's toy. On the other hand, if it's selling at $172, I guess it's hard to argue with success.</blockquote>
<p>The following comes with the caveat that it's wisdom received via the collective gaming press, which is perhaps the most craven, despicable quasi-journalistic industry on Earth that is not peripherally culpable for deaths in Iraq (well, unless you count their <a class="reference external" href="http://pc.ign.com/objects/482/482289.html">coverage</a> of <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America%27s_army">America's Army</a>).</p>
<p>Commenter rlgordonma suggests: &quot;The chips in these units, silly as it seems, are made with the latest and greatest (or next-latest and greatest) 65 nm process.&quot; This affects other consoles, but not the Wii, which uses a conservative chipset that's generally estimated to have about twice the oomph of the Gamecube console that preceded it. In the gaming industry, that's not much of an increase.</p>
<p>There are two factors that definitely affect the supply of Wiis and Wii peripherals, and perhaps a third.</p>
<p>The first, most obvious factor is the Wii's popularity. There's no question any longer: Nintendo has won this generation of the console wars in a way that nobody anticipated. Cruise ship fleets and retirement homes are buying them; <a class="reference external" href="http://www.engadget.com/2008/06/02/sony-secretly-working-on-a-ps3-motion-controlling-remote/">Sony</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1584945/20080404/id_0.jhtml">Microsoft</a> are both readying Wiimote clones. Nintendo's attempt to open an entirely new market for gaming is working better than anyone anticipated. That effect shouldn't be underestimated.</p>
<p>But now, twenty months later, why is Nintendo still unable to respond to this demand? The answer may lie with the second factor: Nintendo's business philosophy. The company is the only game manufacturer <a class="reference external" href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20060915-7752.html">unwilling to take a loss on a console</a> — they never have, and, as far as anyone can tell, they never will. Microsoft and Sony both subsidize the price of their boxes in an effort to capture marketshare then make it up on game, service and accessory sales — the exact amount varies as the supply chain shifts and refines, but at times analysts have estimated that the console subsidy is as high as $100/unit. This makes some sense: Sony and Microsoft share a lot of the same titles, and are both competing to have the best graphics in the industry. Becoming the dominant high-end player is important enough to merit a large up-front investment. Nintendo has more exclusive titles, targets a younger audience and has excused itself from the graphics arms race. But a side effect is that the rate at which Nintendo can make Wiis may be constrained by its unwillingness to lose money on each unit.</p>
<p>Finally, the third effect, though speculative, may be real: a lot of folks think Nintendo has limited the scale of their supply chain in order to create scarcity and media attention. Nintendo denies this; I'm not sure what to think about it. It certainly is a bit hard to believe that supplying Wii Fit's DVD and block of plastic poses the same challenges that the initial console rollout did.</p>

What this makes me really wish is that Marie had a blog, because, as a chemical engineer who just received her PhD working on fuel cell catalysts, this is right up her alley. I hope that she or <a class="reference external" href="http://jeffnye.org">Jeff</a> will pop up in comments and say smart things. And be kind if I say anything dumb.</p>
<p>But at the least I should be able to avoid saying anything as dumb as McCain's battery-prize proposal. Not that I don't like batteries, mind you! But if someone were to invent a better one they'd already be poised to make a huge amount of money through its commercialization. Offering prizes for innovation isn't always a terrible idea — for pharmaceuticals with a limited market of potential users it can make sense due to the huge costs associated with developing and testing a new drug. But <em>everyone</em> in the developed world needs better energy storage technology, and they need it right now. And while it's important to make sure your new batteries are safe and robust (e.g. they don't explode <em>too</em> much), that's still much easier and cheaper to do than it is to conduct a set of double-blind human trials. So sweetening the pot is unnecessary. Anyone who has a good idea about how to build a better battery is already working on the problem.</p>
<p>The other thing to mention is that Drum's concern over lithium is probably misplaced. Lithium's great, and a ringer when it comes to batteries. A cell's energy density is largely determined by the electrical potential between its anode and cathode — the bigger the gap between them, the better. And as you can see from <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_of_standard_electrode_potentials">this chart</a>, electrode potentials don't get much more negative than lithium.</p>
<p>But it's got its problems, too. Lithium wasn't incorporated into mass-market batteries for a long time because of its tendency to catch on fire when exposed to air or charged too quickly. And lithium batteries still tend to dramatically lose capacity about 18 months after they roll off the assembly line, mostly without regard to how hard they've been used. Both of those problems have and continue to be addressed by brilliant electrochemists, and the lithium polymer batteries we use today are fairly miraculous. But it would probably be a mistake to think that lithium technology will get dramatically better than it currently is.</p>
<p>It's also worth noting that not all hybrid or electric cars use lithium batteries. In fact, I don't think many currently do at all — the Prius uses nickel-metal-hydride, a less efficient but longer-lived chemistry. It would just be too expensive to replace the batteries on lithium's lifecycle. So worries about peak lithium should be tempered with the realization that we can make batteries out of other stuff, too.</p>
<p>But that doesn't mean we don't need a better battery. No-combustion vehicles are where everyone agrees we need to go, but they have much more significant battery requirements than hybrids. They have to charge and discharge faster and more completely, both of which are tough on batteries. And they need to provide more total power, too.</p>
<p>Right now the problem looks pretty tough. There are two promising technologies, though. First, nanotechnology and the unbelievably vast electrode surface areas it provides are making ultracapacitors look more and more viable. These devices will never be able to store as much charge as a battery, I don't think, but they can be charged and discharged very quickly and may not suffer the age-related effects that plague chemical cells. From what I've read, they also tend to be built out of less environmentally objectionable materials. As I said, this is no battery replacement, but it may make different kinds of vehicles possible — say, one that's inductively recharged every few miles by a plate embedded in the road. Or they may just replace the battery's buffering function in hybrids, and ease the charge/discharge speed problem in EVs.</p>
<p>The other technology is, of course, fuel cells. Marie tells me they're again falling out of favor, funding-wise, as their recent renaissance falls back in line with a century-long track record of failure to reduce cost and fragility. But it seems inevitable that we'll have to revisit the technology — there's just no better way to safely store lots of energy in a vehicle than with hydrocarbons or some other hydrogen-donating chemical system (I've heard some sort of ammonia pellet system suggested, too). And if you're going to store your energy as hydrocarbons (which isn't to say it has to be pumped out of the ground, of course), fuel cells are the most efficient way to turn it back into usable power.</p>
<p>That's my understanding of the situation, anyway. Hybrids seem likely to stick around for longer than many people suspect, I think. Electric vehicles may be great for getting around towns, but I think people are going to balk the first time they try to use the A/C and realize just how many watt-hours they're spending, and how few they have with them on board their petroleum-free car.</p>

                    <p>The Wii Twilight Princess hack (which I wrote about <a class="reference external" href="/2008/03/18/smash/">here</a>) was killed by the system's most recent update, received this week by all Wiis connected to the internet.</p>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="http://hackmii.com/2008/06/june-16-wii-update/">industrious hackers</a> of the net have already figured out a workaround, though. Apparently Nintendo's fix is targeted to Twilight Princess, and scans for the specific corrupted save files that enable the hack. That's already an encouraging sign — there are almost certainly similar vulnerabilities in other games, and if Nintendo is tackling the problem in this piecemeal approach it means that the homebrew scene is unlikely to ever be thwarted for long.</p>
<p>But the specifics of the update are even more cheer-inducing: <a class="reference external" href="http://hackmii.com/2008/06/wii-menu-tp-hack-killer-analysis/">apparently there are some bugs in the update code</a> which, when exploited in tandem, make it possible to continue using the TP hack.

<p>All of this is comes from <a class="reference external" href="http://hackmii.com">hackmii.com</a> (via <a class="reference external" href="http://hackaday.com">Hack a Day</a> — yes, again), which seems to be home to some of the web's foremost Wii reverse engineers.</p>

<p>Besides, I've got another project slowly coming together. But perhaps I'll bug the Dorkbot guys for advice once I'm done with that. In the meantime, it's great to see more of these things actually being built.</p>

My favorite part:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">A very condensed version of copyright history could look like this: texts (1800), works (1900), tools (2000). Originally the law was designed to regulate the use of one machine only: the printing press. It concerned the reproduction of texts, printed matter, without interfering with their subsequent uses. Roughly around 1900, however, copyright law was drastically extended to cover works, independent of any specific medium. This opened up the field for collective rights management organizations, which since have been setting fixed prices on performance and broadcasting licenses. Under their direction, very specific copyright customs developed for each new medium: cinema, gramophone, radio, and so forth. This differentiation was undermined by the emergence of the Internet, and since about the year 2000 copyright law has been pushed in a new direction, regulating access to tools in a way much more arbitrary than anyone in the pre-digital age could have imagined.</div>
<div class="line">...</div>
<div class="line">For regulations like these to be effective, it is necessary also to censor the sharing of skills that potentially can be useful for coding illegal software. The circle of prohibition grows still larger: Acoustic fingerprinting technologies, which have nothing copyright-infringing to them, but which can be used for the same feared identification of individual tracks, must probably also be restricted.</div>
<div class="line">This domino effect captures the essence of copyright maximalism: Every broken regulation brings a cry for at least one new regulation even more sweepingly worded than the last. Copyright law in the 21st century tends to be less concerned about concrete cases of infringement, and more about criminalizing entire technologies because of their potential uses.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>I like the texts/works/tools breakdown, but I suspect this last phase is mostly a temporary blip rather than a fundamental legislative shift. The content industry, increasingly cognizant of the inescapable technological truths Fleischer details, is thrashing around like a robot moaning &quot;DOES NOT COMPUTE&quot; over a logical paradox. The DMCA and WIPO's efforts to ban &quot;circumvention devices&quot; no longer seem to me to be a credible long-term threat. For one thing, noteworthy political opposition has mobilized in response. For another, such regulations pose a real danger to technological advancement, and thereby corporate bottom lines. If a legislative battle is between the media companies and private citizens, the media companies are a pretty safe bet. If it's between the media companies and a score of other industries, the odds shift — and I think that's exactly what has begun to happen.</p>
<p>Or maybe my optimism is just born of boredom over endlessly reviewing the same inescapable logic. At this point it's clear: the only way we're going to return to a scarcity-based market for mass-appeal IP is if there's some sort of global cataclysm. Which I'm not ruling out! (But which most sane people do.)</p>
<p>Failing that, I agree with pretty much all of Fleischer's points — except for the one about Google. I know the people behind the Pirate Bay (with which Fleischer is affiliated) don't think what they're doing is criminal. But from their choice of name — and Fleischer's essay — it's clear that they understand the confrontational, norm-busting nature of their work. They're unapologetic revolutionaries, whereas Google makes a good-faith effort to play by the rules. That's a real difference from both a legal and PR standpoint. It's dishonest to the point of counterproductivity to pretend that it's all the same.</p>
<p>Anyway, from what I can infer from the Cato website, <a class="reference external" href="http://angryblog.org">Tim</a> will have a response up later this week, which I'm looking forward to.</p>

<p>For a while now I've been encouraging people to jailbreak their iPhones. And for a while now I've found myself without a good answer when they ask, &quot;Why should I?&quot;</p>
<p>Thanks to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ziphone.org/">ZiPhone</a> it's not a difficult operation, but the payoff to replacing the little AT&amp;T logo with your name isn't enough to overcome the fear most people feel when they contemplate fiddling with their shiny new status symbol's brains. I think it's worth it: the Terminal app is incredibly handy if you're the sort of person who regularly has to SSH into their own laptop to manually kill a runaway process. But there aren't too many people who fit that description. Tinyproxy, which can theoretically provide emergency internet for your laptop over the phone's cell connection, is a comforting safety blanket. But of course the connection is incredibly slow, and it takes a good five minutes to complete the necessary configuration on the laptop and phone prior to each use, and it didn't work at all the last time I needed it.</p>
<p>But lo! There's finally a reason to unlock your phone that doesn't include pornographic videogames or touchscreen guitar simulations: <a class="reference external" href="http://www.intelliborn.com/">IntelliScreen</a>, which adds weather, email, calendar and other notifications to your phone's lock screen. It's pretty nice; give it a try.</p>

                    <p>It's hard to maintain a sense of what counts as novel. I run into this all the time when trying to come up with posts for <a class="reference external" href="http://techdirt.com">TechDirt</a>: the struggle to construct an interesting perspective rather than a bland restatement of what should be obvious to any casual observer. Yet, often as not when I fail and post something that seems like a vanilla rehashing of well-trodden ground, the comments fill up with people who are confused or shocked or in violent disagreement over what I thought were settled issues.</p>
<p>Basically, I need to get out more. On the internet, I mean.</p>
<p>Or I at least need to recognize that there might be some merit to repeating myself. With that in mind, let's talk about software patents — partly because of this newfound resolution, and partly because I just can't help myself.</p>
<p>So: Matt put up a <a class="reference external" href="http://matthewyglesias.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/05/math_you_cant_use.php">post</a> pointing to Tim's <a class="reference external" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/techliberation/~3/290419187/">review</a> of <em>Math You Can't Use</em>, a book which explains why software patents are a bad idea. Yglesias's commenters are being surprisingly dense about this. Let's try this one more time:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">When ever anyone owns property (real, personal or intellectual) there are always those complain the whole system of ownership is a drag on them. They are right. They are also blind to the bigger picture. Failure to protect legitimate property interests has bigger problems, long term, in that there is no incentive of the property owner to invest and develop the property if he cannot obtain a return on his investment. It is no surprise that there is a strong relationship between protection of property rights and long term economic growth.</div>
<div class="line">Last I looked, I didnt think that those countries who had nationalized property for the &quot;national interest&quot; were doing so well, economically.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>But of course physical property transfers are zero sum. That's not true for intellectual property transfers — copies of ideas are free. Screaming &quot;commie!&quot; at a copyright reformer is incoherent and always has been.</p>
<blockquote>
[W]hat I see is that A gets a patent, B finds it inconvenient, and argues that the whole system is broken. The main argument presented by B (and friends) is that it makes life and business difficult for B.</blockquote>
<p>Well... yeah. But this is a <em>good</em> argument. Again, the glaringly obvious: the enforcement of intellectual property laws (and thereby the concept of intellectual property itself) is about costs and benefits. What cost shall we impose on society by restricting the value-generating copying of ideas in order that new ideas will remain plentiful and of high quality? We stop people from copying songs so that singers will keep singing. We stop people from copying drugs so that chemists will keep formulating. We stop people from selling counterfeit Mickey Mouse paraphenalia so that crazed fascist sympathizers will continue to dream up beloved children's characters and, one day, be able to afford to cryogenically preserve their bodies.</p>
<p>Clearly, there is an equilibrium to be sought. We need new drugs, but we do not want aspirin to cost $10 per pill. The thing is, the last few years have demonstrated that for many areas of creative endeavor we have <em>massively</em> overestimated the compensation that must be provided in order for society to continue enjoying plentiful ideas. The success of the open source movement and the continued fecundity of the music industry, for example, clearly show that we, the greedy masses, can help ourselves to considerably more free intellectual output than we'd thought without endangering the whole system. We'll all enjoy the benefits — as well as the savings to be had by not spending as many of our resources on enforcing IP laws.</p>
<p>Of course, how far this can be pushed is up for debate. Other fields — publishing, filmmaking, drug discovery — may not be as adaptable. In some cases I'm optimistic that the associated capital costs have or will fall to the point where creator compensation can be safely diminished in order to benefit us all. But now we're getting into the weeds. Clearly there ought to be a negotiation around each IP-producing field to determine whether the benefits provided by restricting the use of its output outweigh the value lost by imposing that restriction.</p>
<p>And for software patents, the situation is extraordinarily clear: it's very hard to find a software author who thinks that patents have contributed anything useful to the process of innovation. In fact, most developers think that patents have exerted a significant retarding effect. If that weren't the case — if the ideas produced and protected under the software patent system were the sorts of novel and valuable contributions that the system is designed to encourage — one might expect to have heard about them.</p>
<p>Well, which ones <em>have</em> we heard about? The three most famous, I'd say, are the Amazon 1-Click patent, which concerns users buying items with a single mouse click; the LZW patent, which involves the compression algorithm used in the GIF file format; and the Eolas patent, which is about a web browser's ability to embed other programs, like Flash movies, Java applets or ActiveX controls, into rendered webpages.</p>
<p>The first thing to realize about all of these is that they're pretty stupid. The Amazon patent is famous because it's such an obvious idea that its legal protection inspires disbelief. Perhaps more compelling is the Eolas patent. But again, the notion of having an application deputize another program to render content is pretty obvious; in fact, there was <a class="reference external" href="http://www.w3.org/2003/10/27-rogan.html">prior art</a> that many thought should have prevented the patent from being granted. It was not an idea that needed protection in order for it to spring to life.</p>
<p>But the LZW patent is probably the most emblematic. <a class="reference external" href="http://www.dspguide.com/ch27/5.htm">LZW is a compression algorithm that was granted patent protection</a>. Compuserve baked it into the GIF file format without realizing it was protected, and GIF attained widespread use. Then the owners of LZW came forward and started asking for payments. Whoops! Almost immediately the PNG format sprang into being — it turns out that LZW wasn't all that important; there were plenty of other ways to solve the problem, many of them free. But by that point GIF was baked into enough applications that for many there wasn't much choice but to knuckle under to the demand for royalties.</p>
<p>This kind of so-called &quot;submarine&quot; patent is the real threat. It's a tremendous boon to our society that a creative individual can start writing valuable software with a few hundred dollars' worth of hardware and an internet connection. Software patents add &quot;... and an attorney on retainer&quot; to that list. It's simply not possible to know if you're in violation of a patent without conducting an expensive search. And even that's no guarantee.</p>
<p>Imposing significant costs in order to subsidize things that don't need subsidizing is wasteful and dumb — particularly when the relative costs and benefits are this far out of whack.</p>

                    <p>You know I love you. But these two stories are really, really embarrassing:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=90309540">Cyber Attacks in China Target Activists, Journalists</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=90285155">Elvis, bin Laden and Hitler Join Mission to Mars</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Story A:</strong> A number of people with interests that generally or specifically oppose those of the Chinese government have received emails carrying trojan malware payloads. Some of these emails appear to be from the recipients' trusted contacts.</p>
<p>Nobody involved with the story seems to realize that a lot of email trojans replicate by opening the victim's address book and sending themselves to everyone found within. Nor is it unusual for keyloggers to be installed. As far as I can tell there is nothing linking these attacks to China — although of course there are a lot of hackers in China, and hackers frequently employ nationalist (e.g. anti-Israeli, anti-American) rhetoric when defacing websites. Again, there's no reason to believe there's a government link here.</p>
<p>If the Chinese government wanted to go after these people, they would employ more sophisticated methods. This is not a story.</p>
<p><strong>Story B:</strong> NASA is running a few different outreach programs whereby internet users can submit names or messages that will be burned to DVD and shot into space. The reporter repeatedly asks affiliated officials: &quot;What if someone includes Osama Bin Laden's name? Or Adolf Hitler's!!?&quot; Someone already has, apparently. The officials correctly respond to this by shrugging.</p>
<p>Really, NPR: what do you think is going to happen? An alien-assisted Caliphate spurred by the inclusion of our enemies' names? Who do you think is going to retrieve this DVD from the infinite emptiness, and know how to decode it, and then know what a bunch of <em>proper nouns</em> mean?</p>
<p>And if your critique has more to do with the inappropriate use of government resources, then let me ask you — what do you think the marginal cost of an extra dozen bytes on a DVD is? A hint: it's less than the cost of paying someone to vet every submission. And it's certainly less than the value of several minutes of broadcast time on public airwaves.</p>

                    <p>Slashdot <a class="reference external" href="http://hardware.slashdot.org/hardware/08/05/06/2032216.shtml">posted</a> something yesterday; today I gave it a try. Apparently the <a class="reference external" href="http://chdk.wikia.com/wiki/CHDK">CHDK project</a> allows you to supplement your Canon camera's firmware. The modified software allows you to override the rather constrained exposure times and ISO settings, and do other fun things like shoot in RAW, trigger exposures via USB, record longer movies and even set the camera up to take pictures whenever it detects motion. There are also a few less useful applications thrown in:</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/2473392789/"><img alt="playing reversi, compliments of CHDK" class="center" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3248/2473392789_48512f6896.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: 375px;" /></a></p>
<p>Reversi! Neat.</p>
<p>Installation is pretty painless: after figuring out your camera's firmware revision, you download and copy two files to the root directory of your SD card. Then boot into picture-viewing mode and go to the &quot;update firmware&quot; menu option. Despite what this sounds like, it's all reversible: by default you'll have to repeat the operation every time you turn the camera on. And even if you set it to automatically boot, you can always revert to the stock firmware by deleting the files from the memory card.</p>
<p>My geriatric SD400 is juuuust below the cutoff for official distributions, but a little searching turned up a <a class="reference external" href="http://chdk.wikia.com/wiki/SD400">beta release</a> that seems to work fine. If your camera isn't listed as being supported, use the wiki's search function.</p>
<p>I'm afraid that my camera hasn't got enough life left in it to really make good use of this new photographic freedom — the focus hasn't been great ever since some sand got into it at the beach. But knowing that these capabilities exist makes me virtually certain to buy another Canon when I finally decide to replace it.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>So! Let's talk about what I've been working on. I wasn't very good about documenting my WMATA picture frame build. This time I'm aspiring to do a better job.</p>
<p>At the moment I'm working on getting a 10x20 array of LEDs working. I haven't completely made up my mind about what I'm going to use it to display, but it'll be something that can be hung on the wall, I think. At the moment there are two parts to the project.</p>
<p>First is the array of LEDs. I'm using a sheet of pegboard for spacing; last night I began soldering them together. As you can see, I still have a lot of work ahead of me. I installed 70 LEDs last night over the course of two or three hours (admittedly, with breaks for dinner and the expression of my very important opinions regarding American Idol). That's 35% of the total number.</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/2473114747/"><img alt="miles to go..." class="center" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3276/2473114747_7ed146e1bb.jpg" style="width: 375px; height: 500px;" /></a></p>
<p>Each hole in the board has an LED, to which a resistor is attached. The anodes of every LED in a row are electrically unified; the cathodes in every column will be, too. This lets me avoid having to use 200 individual on/off connections. Instead I'll rely on persistence of vision: each row will be powered up in sequence, and during that period each column will be switched on or off. One row — ten LEDs — will be illuminated at any given instant. By flipping through rows very quickly the display will appear to be continuously on. Our retinas are stupid that way.</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/2473934182/"><img alt="closeup of the assembly" class="center" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2208/2473934182_d09f376304.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: 375px;" /></a></p>
<p>The advantage gained by this is that I only need 30 connections instead of 200. That's an improvement — much less soldering! — but still more connections than the Arduino has to offer.</p>
<p>So, to expand the available connections (which I should really be calling pins, and will be from here on out) I'll be using four daisy-chained five-bit shift registers. These are integrated circuits that require various connections — power, ground, and some others supporting optional functions that I'm not using — but the real action happens on the chips' input and clock pins. You set the input pin to a desired value; you then flip the clock pin on and off. The chip then remembers the value that was on the input pin, and begins displaying it on its first output pin. If you do the same thing, the originally-remembered value is moved to the second output pin, and the new input value takes the first position. In this way you can shift bits down the line — and by connecting one chip's final output to another's input, you can make the line arbitrarily long. Voila: as many output pins as you need, all at the cost of a mere two Arduino output pins.</p>
<p>The video below is a proof-of-concept for this commonly-used idea — it's just my effort to make sure I know what I'm doing before I start making irreversible soldered connections. The Boarduino (the thing with the blinking red light) is connected to the first shift register (the chip closest to the Boarduino), and set to send four ON signals, then four OFF signals (distinguishing the divisions between each one by flipping the clock signal, which is indicated by the flashing red LED).</p>
<p>In the actual device each shift register output will provide power to an entire row's anodes — there will only be one ON bit at a time, and it will travel down the twenty outputs in sequence. This is why there are transistors in the setup, too: the shift register could provide enough current for a single LED, but ten would be pushing it. The transistor allows a very small current from the shift register to switch on a much larger current.</p>
<p>Electronically astute readers might be asking themselves why I'm going to the trouble of attaching 200 resistors (and for my electronically non-astute readers: the resistors are necessary to keep the LEDs from consuming too much current and burning out). After all, if only ten LEDs will actually be on at a time, why not just have ten resistors — one for each column?</p>
<p>There are a couple of reasons, most of them related to a lack of confidence in my ability to keep just one row enabled, particularly during the debugging process. First, in general it's a bad idea to have LEDs sharing resistors. If one LED fails the other one may suddenly experience twice the current you had intended, and will also fail immediately. Second, the resistors are rated for a half-watt of power dissipation. Each LED consumes about 30 milliwatts; if an entire column is illuminated, that'd put me 20% over spec for the resistors. I probably could've gotten away with shared resistors in this case, but I'm still sufficiently unsure of what I'm doing that I didn't want to risk it. Besides, all that additional soldering will build character.</p>

                    <p>Can I tell you what they are? No. Can I tell you what they do? Not really. But they appear to be a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.informationweek.com/news/hardware/processors/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=207403582&amp;pgno=1&amp;queryText=&amp;isPrev=">pretty incredibly big deal</a> for the world of electronics. When something exists theoretically for decades before it becomes possible to fabricate; when it has implications for the fundamental ways a discipline explains its workings; and when, so shortly after its announced discovery, it's already been integrated into functioning systems: these are all reasons to be excited. It'll be a while before we come up with metaphors that can describe what the hell these things do in a way that makes intuitive sense to you and me, but it's not too early to recognize that, if the claims associated with memristors are true, their discovery is of immense importance.</p>
<p>Incidentally, it may seem as though I'm being a bit credulous about this seemingly huge upheaval in the world of fundamental electronics. Maybe I am, but I have a reason: the way we teach and understand the physics underlying electronic systems is totally screwed up.</p>
<p>It's all Ben Franklin's fault: not only was he a total jerk to John Adams (apparently), he also guessed the direction of electricity wrong. He thought it went from positive to negative, but in fact the electrons involved travel in the other direction. But by the time we had figured that out, enough progress had been made under the original explanatory framework that everyone just said &quot;what the hell&quot; and plunged onward. We still talk and teach and diagram as if current flows from positive to negative. And it works! But in order to make it work we've had to fool ourselves into thinking virtually every component in a circuit works the opposite way that it actually does. Fortunately once you reach a certain level of abstraction it becomes easy to ignore the situation, and eventually it recedes from your attention and ceases to be confusing.</p>
<p>But it's still a bit appalling, which makes it easy for me to believe that the discipline has overlooked fundamental truths in the way that Prof. Chua alleges in <a class="reference external" href="http://www.informationweek.com/news/hardware/processors/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=207403582&amp;pgno=1&amp;queryText=&amp;isPrev=">the article</a>.

                    <p>Well, probably not. The spam problem on Twitter isn't really that much of a problem, thanks to the clever way that following works.

                    <p>One of the projects I've been fiddling with recently has been <a class="reference external" href="http://mobile.processing.org/">Mobile Processing</a>. You might remember me <a class="reference external" href="/2006/12/11/progressing-with-processing/">screwing around</a> with its parent project, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.processing.org">Processing</a>, in 2006. That project's cross-platform IDE and open ethos has spread to a number of other projects, including <a class="reference external" href="http://www.arduino.cc">Arduino</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.wiring.org.co/">Wiring</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.fritzing.org/">Fritzing</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://mobile.processing.org">Mobile Processing</a>. Of these, Mobile Processing is probably the most like Processing proper, in that it attempts to provide an easy-to-use environment for writing small applications that can display graphics, respond to input and manipulate system devices. The only difference is that Processing Mobile is designed to work on J2ME-capable mobile phones.</p>
<p>In Washington, DC, the cheapest compatible phone that I'm aware of is Boost Mobile's i425, a crappy candybar handset from Motorola's iDEN line. It costs $40, which includes activation and $5 worth of Boost credit. Better still, for thirty-some cents a day you get unlimited data access. It's a GSM phone — speed won't be great — but still: unlimited data! <strong>And</strong> it has GPS! Surely that's enough to excuse its bulk and awful, awful screen.</p>
<p>All that you have to do to get it working with Processing Mobile <a class="reference external" href="http://developer.motorola.com/">sign up for a free developer account with Motorola</a>, download their IDENJAL tool (Windows only, unfortunately), and then use it to load a Processing Mobile sketch's compiled Midlet onto the phone over USB.</p>
<p>With much greatly-appreciated assistance from the man himself, I've been trying to follow in the footsteps of <a class="reference external" href="http://five.b.oh.googlepages.com/">five.b.oh</a>, who successfully got a similar phone to speak to his Arduino over a serial connection. If I can succeed in replicating that effort, I think this will be the most economical means of getting the Arduino online from anywhere.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, five.b.oh's phone is a different model from mine. His is a little older, and still uses a straightforward serial cable — one that, with some voltage-shifting circuitry, is pretty easy to connect to an Arduino. The i425 is too clever for its own good, and hides its serial port behind a USB connection. I'm confident that there *is* a serial port, since its baud rate can be set through the phone's menu system (five.b.oh also supplied me with a sketch that enumerates system ports, which prompted the i425 to spit out &quot;COM0&quot; — that's a good sign). But how can I get to that serial signal? Unfortunately USB-to-serial cables won't work in this case, I believe, since they rely upon a USB host controller being on one end. Both the phone and the Arduino will be acting as USB clients.</p>
<p>So I disassembled the phone, hoping to find a silkscreened label pointing me to the serial signal somewhere upstream from the USB chip. That was wishful thinking. So I'm posting the photos here, and crossposting to some relevant forums in the hopes that someone with more electronics experience will be inspired to offer a suggestion. How do I proceed? Are there things I should be looking for? Something in these photographs that looks particularly promising? Do I need an oscilloscope, or can I just probe with the Arduino's serial RX pin (under the assumption that I can trust the baud rate set on the phone)? What's the best way to get those metal covers off of the PCB?</p>
<p>Any advice is much appreciated. These pictures are taken in order of disassembly: imagine the phone on a table facing you, with the keypad closest to you. The phone has a top screen section, and two layers of PCBs under the keypad. These fold up like the advancing pages of a calendar.</p>
<p>Click the images to get to their Flickr pages, which contain higher resolution versions and notes on various components that I'm able to identify.</p>

<p>If you're disassembling the phone yourself you'll need to remove a set of hex screws from the back (with back cover removed), then remove the front cover. At that point the keypad PCB can be carefully pulled up from the bottom of the handset — don't panic at the resistance, as there's a glob of adhesive goo there. There are a few more screws to contend with, and then the bottom PCB will lift up as well.</p>
<p>If this fails I plan to experiment with one-way communication to an Arduino by flashing the screen to encode data that can be detected by a phototransistor connected to the Arduino. But I'd rather have a clean serial connection.</p>

<p>On Tuesday night I successfully assembled a <a class="reference external" href="http://ladyada.net/make/boarduino/">Boarduino</a> kit for the first time. I had tried once before and accidentally swapped the two electrolytic capacitors — whoops. But I placed an order for a couple more kits, and their creator, Lady Ada, was even nice enough to send an extra one my way. Thanks!</p>
<p>The Arduino, as you might know from my earlier ramblings, is a microcontroller doohickey that can run tiny programs and read and write signals from its twenty or so connections. It can also talk to your computer over USB.</p>
<p>The Boarduino is pretty much the same thing. This is one of the benefits of the Arduino being an open platform: it can be freely copied. The Boarduino is just as open, as Lady Ada provides downloadable schematics that you can use to print your own circuit boards if you'd like.</p>
<p>There are a few differences between the Boarduino and a standard Arduino, though. First, it looks very different. That's because it's designed to be plopped into a breadboard, which is a commonly used mechanism for wiring up prototype circuits without soldering anything. Second, it's sold as a kit that has to be <a class="reference external" href="http://ladyada.net/make/boarduino/solder.html">assembled and soldered</a>, which makes it cheaper. Third, it moves the chip that translates from USB to serial (which the Arduino chip can understand) into a reusable cable instead of keeping it on the Arduino, which makes it cheaper still. This means that for applications where a connection to a computer is important, the Boarduino doesn't make that much sense.</p>
<p>But if your application stands on its own and you don't mind spending some time soldering the Boarduino is a great option. And a kit only costs $17.50 — about half as much as an assembled, full-featured Arduino.</p>

<p>In other Wii news, it looks like the homebrew scene is heating up a bit. First, there was this:</p>
<p><center><object width="425" height="355"><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/H5YB1Mmx7E4&amp;hl=en" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="355"></embed></object></center></p><p>At the CCC these guys presented a significant advance. The Wii can emulate the Gamecube console that preceded it. And software tools for running homebrew applications on the Gamecube are, as you might expect, better developed than those for the Wii. Those tools can run on the Wii, but only in Gamecube mode, which locks programs out of the console's enticing new features — things like Wiimote control and network connectivity. These guys found a way to scan the device's ordinarily-protected memory space from Gamecube mode and plucked some encryption keys from it. Using those keys they can create discs that the Wii thinks are Wii games, which consequently have complete access to the console's hardware resources. Neat, huh?</p>
<p>But more immediately relevant to home users is the so-called &quot;Twilight Hack&quot;, which debuted in February. The Zelda game for the Wii is called The Twilight Princess and it contains that perennial favorite, a buffer overflow vulnerability.</p>
<p>Think of it like this: a computer's memory is filled with a very long list of things it has to do, and it proceeds through these steps in order. Some of these instructions tell it to jump to other places in the list, some of them tell it to manipulate different parts of the list, and some of them tell it to run comparisons on the list and do different things depending on the result. In simple systems the memory is allocated as needed, which can result in a chunk of data like an image sitting next to a chunk of code that will actually be fed to the processor. As you might imagine, maintaining the boundaries between these regions is important.</p>
<p>But it's easy to screw up and forget to do it when loading a file's contents into memory, particularly on a platform like a console. Hey, why bother checking, say, a save game? If it's only your code that's writing the file, and it checks the content's length when it writes it, why check again when you read it? You trust your file-writing code, and where the hell else are save files going to be coming from?</p>
<p>The answer, of course, is hackers. In this case they took a save file and discovered that when it's loaded there's no check on the length of the text string that names Link's horse. So you write a super-long string and when it's loaded into memory it not only writes into the memory set aside for the horse name, but also into the memory after it. You fill that up with what's called a no-op sled — a long list of instructions saying &quot;no operation; do nothing, go to the next step&quot;, at the end of which you put some code that gives you control of the system in one way or another. When, during the normal execution of the game, the processor reads a legitimate instruction telling it to jump somewhere into that no-op-filled region and start executing instructions it will slide allllll the way down the sled and then run your system-pwning code. The sled lets you avoid needing to know precisely where the processor is going to begin reading, improving your odds of getting your code executed.</p>
<p>This, incidentally, is also the technique used to &quot;softmod&quot; an Xbox. There are three different Xbox games that don't properly check their savegames. That's an easy point of entry for a file with a custom payload. The game will have already passed all the security checks built into the system, meaning that any code you can introduce into memory will be treated as part of the game itself — and frequently this will be enough to let you tear down any lingering security for good.</p>
<p>Initially the Twilight Hack required a special (though commercially available) Gamecube SD card adapter, but it's now been improved to the point where you can use the Wii's built-in SD reader, allowing user-created code to be booted from the card slot in the console's front:</p>

That's pretty much par for the course when a new system is opened up: those first two are huge piles of useful code that are freely available, requiring work to adapt but not any original design. Small games like Tetris are also pretty common, serving as necessary learning exercises for probing how the console's various hardware functions operate.</p>
<p>But will there be a proliferation of other software? I'm doubtful. The homebrew scenes for the Dreamcast and Gamecube are cool but haven't yielded any killer apps. The Xbox scene has been more successful, but largely because of the console's beefy specs, onboard hard drive and widely-pirated software development kit. If I had to bet I'd say that continued refinement of WiiLinux and the emulators can be expected, and that there may be a few apps showcasing <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~johnny/projects/wii/">Johnny Lee's neat Wii demos</a>. Maybe there'll be an underpowered media player, too, and a few lousy games. But that will be about it.</p>
<p>Except, of course, for one other application: piracy. The binary game dumps <a class="reference external" href="http://thepiratebay.org/browse/405">are out there</a>, and we can now run arbitrary code. I haven't looked for a writeup yet, but I can guarantee you that someone out there is using Twilight Princess to load pirated games from their Wii's SD card slot.</p>

                    <p>It was very nice of Megan to link to me yesterday (even if the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.manifestdensity.net/2008/02/28/tautologous_but_highly_patenta/#comments">commenters</a> that came along with it proved to be huge pains in the ass). So I hope I won't seem ungrateful if I take issue with <a class="reference external" href="http://meganmcardle.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/02/was_hddvd_done_in_by_a_dirty_d.php">this post</a> about Blu-Ray's eventual triumph over HD-DVD.</p>
<p>Megan's right that I and a lot of my fellow nerds aren't very happy about this outcome, but she's wrong to say that &quot;[e]very time there's a format war, the losers complain that the inferior product won through nefarious methods.&quot; I'm not sure that's a fair characterization. In this case I can admit that Blu-Ray is the technically superior standard. Many technologists didn't like it because it seemed a bit more DRM-laden, because it didn't seem worth the price premium, and because Sony has behaved very badly with respect to proprietary media formats in the past (Redbook/CD excepted, but of course that was a joint venture with Philips). I should say that I don't really have a dog in this fight — I don't own a drive from either camp, and tend to think that we'll only get halfway through this generation of tech before network delivery of video consigns Blu-Ray to a CD-like role (except less useful due to the aforementioned DRM). But that doesn't mean I'm happy with the way things turned out for HD-DVD.</p>
<p>It's not so much that I think there were dirty tricks involved (although there <a class="reference external" href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=08/02/22/1939200">may have been</a>). It's just that it's frustratingly obvious that the factors determining a technology's success frequently have little to do with its capabilities, price, performance or other innate attributes. Rather, they're the result of quirks of the business environment into which the technology is born.</p>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="http://www.reason.com/news/show/29944.html">Reason article that Megan links to</a> irks me much more than her own post, as it consistently fails to understand this. &quot;MS-DOS wasn't an inferior technology that succeeded because of the market landscape and consumers' path dependence,&quot; it says (more or less). &quot;It's just that the licensing environment surrounding IBM PC clones made them cheap, and once consumers started using DOS the costs involved in switching made doing so impractical. So you see, it was the superior technology after all.&quot;</p>
<p>The article does this again and again, most egregiously in the case of Dvorak vs. QWERTY*, where the author desperately tries to establish that actually in all cases the market selects for the optimum technology, always and in perpetuity throughout the universe. I know, I know — if you're a home-row typist you're probably laughing so hard right now that your pinky fell right off the semicolon key. But the argument proceeds anyway, tirelessly pointing out that geek-favored technologies have some downsides, maligned market winners have some upsides, and the way the path-dependent public ultimately chose is proof that the winning tech trumps the former on the merits.</p>
<p>Well, if you define &quot;the merits&quot; as &quot;the sum of all factors facing the public&quot; then yes, that's true. But this amounts to merely asserting that we live in an at least semi-rational universe, which isn't a very useful or original conclusion. The fact is that in many cases it would be better if those factors were weighted differently. As things stand, they're generally configured to serve the interests of the businessmen at the beginning of the process more than the consumers at the end of it, and that's a shame.</p>
<p>I suppose I shouldn't get too upset; this is just a variant on the Libertarian tendency to perpetually declare ours the best of all possible worlds (except for the parts they don't like). But it's still frustrating to read stuff like that Reason article. You just <em>know</em> that the author doesn't use a command line.</p>
<p>* Special bonus sophistry: pointing out methodological errors in pro-Dvorak studies, then buttressing the point with pro-QWERTY studies... full of methodological errors. Unless you <em>really</em> think it's fair to compare the marginal benefit of training to a group of experienced QWERTY typists and newly-trained Dvorak typists.</p>

                    <p>Whoops! We got a DMCA notice at work today from our ISP, and I'm to blame. It was an accident, honest! I had (allegedly!) been downloading episode five of The Wire's current season and neglected to shut off my Bittorrent app before leaving home. Apparently HBO took notice and didn't take kindly to it.</p>
<p>First: I'm currently an HBO subscriber, so I'm feeling pretty karmically okay about all of this.</p>
<p>Second: I may have been downloading a bunch of other season 6 eps at the same time (I had a plane ride ahead of me and catching up to do!) but HBO apparently only noticed the torrent for episode 5 — a lousy torrent made from an HBO screener DVD, incidentally, with horribly clipping audio throughout. It wasn't even the good stuff! It makes me wonder if they're particularly sensitive to leaked screeners.</p>
<p>Third: although I'm being flip, this is still an embarrassing and stupid mistake. The last thing I want to do was expose the company to liability so that I can timeshift my preferred crime dramas. The odds of dire consequences arising from this particular incident seem to be fairly nonexistent, but it's certainly something I want to avoid in the future. Having no faith in myself, I turn to technology.</p>
<p>OS X maintains an app called Kicker that does various things when network events occur — things like changing wifi access points. It also has an XML configuration file you can modify that'll allow you to run your own scripts. Scripts like this one:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="literal-block">
#!/bin/sh
#get the ssid of the network
ssid=`ioreg -l -n AirPortDriver | grep APCurrentSSID | sed 's/^.*= &quot;\(.*\)&quot;.*$/\1/; s/ /_/g'`
#fill in your own values for ssid and location below
if [ $ssid = &quot;YourWirelessNetwork&quot; -o $ssid = &quot;YourOtherWirelessNetwork&quot; ]
then
`killall Transmission`
fi
exit 0
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.transmissionbt.com/">Transmission</a> is the name of the app I use for Bittorrent. You'll want to change that and the wifi network placeholders (capitalization matters!). Then you'll want to save that file somewhere safe and `chmod +x <em>whatever_you_called_it</em>`. Then follow <a class="reference external" href="http://www.macgeekery.com/gspot/2006-05/hacking_kicker_and_configd_to_run_your_scripts">these directions</a> for editing Kicker.xml so that it'll run your script. Voila! The script will run whenever you change networks. It'll check the name of the network and, if there's a match, terminate the Transmission application (potentially messily, I should add — this may be bad for your downloads in progress).</p>
<p>All in all, a pretty clever way to avoid my own stupidity. Hopefully someone else will find it useful, too.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Hmm. After installing this setup I began to experience some pretty weird system blocking errors — most noticeably Terminal.app freezing, but other weirdness, too. You may want to hold off on it for now. I'm giving it another go using a Ruby script that forks immediately in the hopes that this will prevent anything from sticking:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="literal-block">
#!/usr/bin/ruby
pid = fork do
#get the ssid of the network
ssid = `ioreg -l -n AirPortDriver | grep APCurrentSSID | sed 's/^.*= &quot;\(.*\)&quot;.*$/\1/; s/ /_/g'`
#fill in your own values for ssid and location below
if ((ssid =~ /YourWirelessNetwork/i) || (ssid =~ /YourOtherWirelessNetwork/i))
`killall Transmission&amp;`
end
end
</pre>

                    <p>The Comcast installation guys came by yesterday, and I said a sad goodbye to our beloved DirecTivo. The Comcast DVR seems pretty lame, but it's indisputably hi-def. I can see the marks on Michael Chiarello's cutting board! I can see the mottled horror of Fox 5 special correspondent <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan%27s_run">Logan 3</a>! It looks great, even if the software doesn't have a very consistent idea of what the &quot;back&quot; button is supposed to do (you might think the answer would be &quot;go back&quot;, but that just betrays your lack of imagination).</p>
<p>We haven't got internet service yet, though. I thought I had a cable modem kicking around, but so far haven't been able to find it. The Comcast guys offered me a modem with an integrated router, but that would've cost us an extra $2 per month. More importantly, it would've brought the total number of active, transmitting wifi routers in the apartment up to five*. Even I realize that's too many.</p>
<p>So: if you happen to have a spare cablemodem lying around that you wouldn't mind parting with for an eBay-ish price, please let me know. I admit that I'm not too keen to begin using Comcast's internet service after reading (and writing) so much about their Bittorrent-throttling shenanigans. But — chalk up another vote for custom Linux firmwares — my Linksys router runs iptables, which means that adding <a class="reference external" href="http://autoignition.net/2007/10/17/comcast-bittorrent-seeding-fix/">this</a> to its startup scripts should make it ignore the forged RST packets that Comcast is using to stymie seeders. I think it'll still be a step up from our decrepit Verizon DSL.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Crap, nevermind. <a class="reference external" href="http://www.dslreports.com/forum/r19036168-Tests-and-ResultsRSTs-are-set-in-both-directions">It looks like Comcast sends reset packets in both directions</a>, which means that iptables-based fixes won't do anything unless they're implemented for both you and the person with whom you're exchanging data — and the odds of that being the case aren't very good. Boo.</p>

                    <p>I have <a class="reference external" href="http://labs.echoditto.com/iphone-presence-detection">a post up over at EchoDitto Labs</a> talking about detecting the presence of an iPhone over a wifi network.</p>
<p>The basic idea is pretty simple: you set up your router so that it always gives the phone the same IP address (you *are* running a <a class="reference external" href="http://dd-wrt.com/dd-wrtv2/index.php">custom Linux firmware</a>, right?). Then you run a script every minute or so that pings the phone's assigned address (the script can also be run on the router). Depending on whether the ping is successful, you perform an action — in the post I just log the results and then graph them, but it'd be just as easy to have the router load a given webpage. I'm thinking that it might be neat to have my router and Emily's router both report to this site whenever they see me. I could use that data to populate a little box on the sidebar indicating whether I'm in Philly or DC. Or at work, I suppose.</p>
<p>But I'm not sure what granularity I want to provide for such a display, or if it'd actually be useful to anybody. It is, I admit, pretty creepy.</p>

                    <p>A couple of days ago <a class="reference external" href="http://grammarpolice.net">Kriston</a> hit me up with a question on behalf of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.mattwrightphotography.blogspot.com/">Matt</a>, who's in Germany and found himself stymied by NBA League Pass Broadband's insistence that he be in America in order to watch the games he'd paid for. I suggested he give <a class="reference external" href="http://tor.eff.org">Tor</a> a try and hey! Somewhat to my surprise, it actually worked. For those of you facing similar problems, here's Matt's advice:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Tom, great recommendation on Tor. It's not 100% perfect, but I've found a way to do what I need to do. The key is that you can view the Tor Network Map and monitor where the final Relay, as they call it, is located. For my specific problem I just had to make sure that last relay was in the U.S.</div>
<div class="line">More specifically, to get it to work, I just had to keep trying connections until the series of relays ended in a computer in the U.S. Then I just loaded the NBA League Pass Broadband, it thought I was from the States, and I was able to launch the streaming RealPlayer app. The quality of the feed seemed to synch up with the bandwidth readings I was getting from Tor -- it was still slow, mind you, but if all three of my Relays had high bandwidth, the streaming video worked fine. It also proved to be a good idea to leave the connection uninterrupted (you can switch from one live game to another normally), in case Tor switched Relays on you.</div>
<div class="line">A <a class="reference external" href="http://flickr.com/photos/sbma44/2214835428/">screenshot</a> is attached. This technique is also probably really useful when trying to stream radio over the internet. I've run into similar problems out here where stations weren't allowed to stream their station outside the U.S. Don't ask me why.</div>
<div class="line">Oh, and for Tor to have been perfect, the feature I would've liked is to be able to specify which country was the final chain in the Relay, obviously, instead of a guess and check method.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>If you're running into similar problems, it might be worth giving this a try. But Tor isn't anything magic. In this context it's just an unusually slow (and unusually reliable) proxy server — it encrypts everything and sends it through multiple servers to better ensure anonymity, which slows everything down. You can try to find a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.samair.ru/proxy/">single-hop</a> proxy for better performance (be sure to pick one in the right country), but it may take some effort to find one that works: it's safe to assume that most of the proxies on that list don't know their systems are open to relaying traffic from the world. The proxies tend to disappear as their owners become aware that they're being used.</p>
<p>In either case you'll end up needing to edit your network settings so that they include the address of the HTTP or SOCKS proxy (depending on which type of server it is — HTTP's more common, SOCKS can handle more types of applications). Exactly where to do this may vary. Standalone apps like Realplayer or IM will likely have their own settings. Things like Flash will probably inherit your browser's proxy settings (<a class="reference external" href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/125">here's</a> a handy Firefox extension for changing proxy settings quickly). In some cases you might need to hunt down your operating system's network settings and make the change there. You can find more detailed instructions <a class="reference external" href="http://tor.eff.org">at the Tor project</a>.</p>
<p>But where ever you need to make the change, it's a useful technique to know. Proxies are the best, simplest way to hide where your traffic is coming from (from private system owners — you certainly shouldn't count on it for anything more serious, particularly if you don't know who's running the proxy/Tor exit node; nor should you send any sensitive information across such a link unless using a free-of-error-warnings SSL session). Whether beating DRM, stuffing an online ballot box or leaving an intemperate blog comment, this is something that the enterprising web user will find handy surprisingly often.</p>

<p><strong>Walking ghost phase</strong> (<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking_ghost_phase">Wikipedia</a>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</em></p>
<p>The walking ghost phase of radiation poisoning is a period of apparent health, lasting for hours or days, following a dose of 10-50 sieverts of radiation. As its name would suggest, the walking ghost phase is followed by certain death.</p>
<p><strong>Treatment</strong></p>
<p>All current medical treatments are palliative, largely pain management.</p>
<p><strong>Cause of death</strong></p>
<p>A painful death, marked by delirium and coma, inevitably awaits any recipient of such a dose of radiation, between 2-10 days after the completion of the walking ghost phase of radiation poisoning.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Over time a number of internet strangers have started following me on Twitter. Usually these are robots and I block them. But sometimes they seem to be humans, and in those cases I usually start following them, too, out of a mixture of courtesy and curiousity (I should clarify for any potential readers: if I have ever met you in real life, I am not referring to you).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, so far they've all proven to be truly insufferable net startup aspirants. Their tweets are filled with self-aggrandizing accounts of (unsuccessfully) pitching venture capitalists, and intense discourse about the best way to pitch Walt Mossberg (you can be quite sure none of them ever have), and whether a TechCrunch writeup is really all you need anyway.</p>
<p>I don't know why I don't unsubscribe. I'm sure I will, soon. But every time I get one of these communiques, I think about the subject of the article quoted above. They're all doomed, but they don't know it yet. Maybe they suspect the truth. But that's even worse, because it means they're knowingly spending their last days on earth in stupid, unoriginal ways. It's like a death row inmate asking for his last meal to be from McDonald's. C'mon, you people are supposed to be geeks! Didn't you see how Spock went out at the end of Star Trek II? That guy had class.</p>

                    <p>I may as well add my two cents, speaking as both an all-around nerd and someone who bought a gig of RAM this holiday season (it's the gift that says &quot;Baby, I consider reducing your disk swap space usage a subcomponent of 'treating you right'&quot;). RAM is indeed ridiculously cheap right now — there've been allegations of price-fixing in the memory industry, in fact, as the players try to grapple with the bottom falling out of their market. But a few things about buying memory for your Mac:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Macbooks can only take up to two gigs. Current-generation MBPs can accept 4 gigs. Buying more than this is pointless. Unless you have a particularly memory-hungry application, 2GB is probably as much as you'll notice having. <strong>UPDATE:</strong> Yglesias pointed out to me that I'm wrong — current-generation Macbooks can take 4 gigs, too. You should still probably only buy 2.</li>
<li>Macs are notoriously finicky about memory. Buying a name brand is probably worth the slight price bump. Crucial is a well-regarded brand, if you're looking for a suggestion.</li>
<li>You only get two memory slots in MBs and MBPs, and one of them will already have a stick of RAM in it. Plan accordingly.</li>
<li>You're looking to buy DDR2 SODIMMs.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.newegg.com">Newegg</a> is a good, reputable place to get dirt-cheap prices on memory.</li>
</ul>

                    <p>I whined about not fulfilling my technical aspirations over the holiday, but the truth is that I did get a few things done — just not the ones I had intended. I wasted a solid couple of days trying to get Boot Camp installed, for one thing (it turns out not to be so easy when you have a heavily fragmented disk and aren't willing to reformat it). And I constructed this monstrosity:</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/2162551515/"><img alt="probably ill-advised" class="center" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2110/2162551515_9f2cfb5d90_m.jpg" style="width: 180px; height: 240px;" /></a></p>
<p>We'd hung up lights for a little holiday shindig, you see. But this year we were forced into the bigger-bulbed option, as Target's clearance Christmas light section was picked over a bit faster than I had planned. I think it ended up looking a little bit nicer, but the default level of illumination afforded was a little higher than we wanted for a proper party.</p>
<p>So: to Logan hardware! It's actually pretty simple to make a dimmer box suitable for incandescent bulbs. Grab an extension cord, a dimmer switch, a few spare wire nuts, a junction box and a switch faceplate — I'd suggest plastic for the last two items since a) it's cheaper and b) it's less likely to result in your electrocution if you screw something up. All told your purchase should come to under $10.</p>
<p>Snip the extension cord in two, thread it into the junction box and wire it up to the dimmer as the included instructions dictate. The wire connected to the smaller prong on the extension cord's plug is the hot lead — that's the one that gets routed through the dimmer. The other is neutral; reconnect it to itself. If the extension cord has three prongs, the bottom one is ground; it should be reconnected to itself and to the dimmer's ground wire. If there isn't a ground wire, just wrap the dimmer's ground lead up in tape so it can't accidentally come in contact with anything energized.</p>
<p>Screw everything together and voila: you're done. Keep a fire extinguisher handy, never leave this unattended, never connect it to anything other than a reasonably short string of incandescent lights, and resign yourself to my complete disavowal of any responsibility for the results of using this horribly unsafe gadget. It works great for me, though!</p>

                    <p>I forgot to do the <a class="reference external" href="http://dcist.com/2008/01/02/morning_roundup_163.php">morning roundup</a> last night, so I had to wake up early this morning to do it. First: it was surprisingly easy! I guess having two weeks' worth of sleep saved up makes it possible to get up before 9:30. Second: morning news is even worse than I had imagined.</p>
<p>A moment ago CNN's <em>American Morning</em> is engaging in some legal analysis of the recent noise over whether ripping your own CDs to mp3 is illegal. It's true that this is a bit confusing. For instance, although I respect Mike Masnick's <a class="reference external" href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20071211/101325.shtml">analysis</a> of the issue, I disagree with his assertion that the RIAA only objects to users ripping CDs to shared folders. It's always seemed to me that they <em>tolerate</em> such activity, but consider themselves to be doing so thanks to their basically generous nature (and not, of course, out of fear of a crushing backlash from consumers and the courts). One commenter points out that Sony lawyers have <a class="reference external" href="http://www.engadget.com/2007/10/04/sony-bmgs-head-lawyer-says-ripping-cds-is-stealing/">referred</a> to ripping CDs as &quot;a nice way of saying 'steals just one copy.'&quot;</p>
<p>But I do agree with Mike that the media's treatment of these issues has been abysmal. And even granting that the legalities can be murky, CNN's treatment of the story was stunningly bad, revealing that their legal correspondent is not only completely unacquainted with the relevant issues, but couldn't even be bothered to spend a few minutes on Google reading up on them prior to going on the air.</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">But I have never heard it happen that you buy something legally and then you put it on your own computer to make it more portable, I think so many people do this, and now you've broken the law to the tune of thousands and thousands of dollars.</div>
<div class="line">...</div>
<div class="line">I don't see it as really being legally any different from using your DVR and downloading some shows, some Oprah shows as I do, and putting them on your computer so that I can watch them and make them more portable.</div>
<div class="line">...</div>
<div class="line">You know it's my job to keep up on the legality of things, and <em>I</em> thought it was legal as well.</div>
<div class="line">...</div>
<div class="line">For the viewers out there the takeaway needs to be you have to be very careful. Let's wait until we find out the ruling on this case before you continue downloading these CDs.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>No! The takeaway is that we should grab torches and pitchforks and march down to the courthouse. Or write our congressmen, anyway.</p>
<p>I suppose it's nice that big media outlets are paying attention to these issues. Still, this is pretty piss-poor. The scope of fair use in the digital age may not be as immediate a concern as health care or stagnant wages, but it affects nearly every consumer in the country. People are randomly getting caught in an industry's death throes, and suffering serious financial losses as a result — none of which benefits anyone except the attorneys involved. It's a real problem and we should all be thinking in a deliberate way about how we want to solve it.</p>

<p>Put in simple terms, this lets me translate any information I can pull from the net into physical action. There are limits, of course — can I stream WOXY or play YouTube clips through an Arduino? No. It's a much simpler device than that — one that's basically capable of reading and sending a little more than a dozen low-voltage signals, and about half as many low-voltage analog signals.</p>
<p>But you can get a lot done with these seemingly humble capabilities. I could control appliances; I could wire it into an RC car's remote control; I could use it to open and close my garage door over the internet; I could monitor the temperature in my apartment and send myself an email if the furnace broke.</p>
<p>I'm aiming for something simpler to begin with: the analog display of some interesting online information, courtesy of some cool-looking gauges. If anyone's got a line on awesome-looking vintage electronic equipment that I can tear apart, please let me know.</p>

<p>At least he had the good sense to back off, in comments, from his ludicrous initial argument: that the fair use exception for satire allows <em>any</em> copyrighted material to be used in the parody — regardless of whether it's the subject of the parody or not. If that were the case, Mad Magazine could probably enjoy a sales bump by including burned copies of Photoshop as inserts.</p>
<p>But even in his new, more moderate position (fair use by fiat), Arrington is still wrong. It's an increasingly common mistake: folks use a low-fidelity version of a copyrighted work for illustrative purposes within the context of a larger original work and assume it's okay. It sure <em>seems</em> like this should be okay — it's not the main point of the work, it's just decoration. And it was so easy! I'm all for making this sort of thing kosher when employed by noncommercial projects, but right now it's not. It'd be nice if Arrington was a little less preachy when talking out of his ass.</p>

                    <p>I put up a <a class="reference external" href="http://labs.echoditto.com/hacking-la-fonera">rather long post over at EchoDitto Labs</a> about this, but here's the teaser version: you can get routers from the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.fon.com">FON</a> project for very little money — sometimes free, or about $10 on Ebay. With some effort, you can load them with a custom firmware that gives you a Linux environment that can connect to wifi networks. This <em>also</em> gives you a set of four or five general purpose input/output pins and a (somewhat more accessible) serial port, all of which you can, in theory, connect to an Arduino. Put together, this equals a very cheap wifi interface for your microcontroller project — the fact that it comes with powerful Linux capabilities is just icing on the cake.</p>
<p>It's pretty small, too. So aside from probably consuming electricity faster than a $125 wifi module designed for embedded systems would, it's really a very, very slick solution.</p>
<p>Of course, this is all still kind of theoretical. I've gotten the wifi interface working, and am able to control an LED from the Linux shell. That's enough to interface with the Arduino meaningfully, but I haven't yet tackled the job of connecting it to the serial port.</p>

                    <p>To all you kind, lovely people who follow user &quot;DCist&quot; on Twitter, helping me debug a project or just expressing an interest: I apologize. I've been working on a Ruby reincarnation of my <a class="reference external" href="http://dcist.com/2006/05/09/introducing_las.php">LastCall</a> service.</p>
<p>As part of that I've been using the <a class="reference external" href="http://socket7.net/software/jabber-bot">jabber-bot</a> Ruby Gem, which does most of the grunt work of setting up an IM bot. You define the patterns it recognizes, then it hands those off to your script. If it doesn't recognize an incoming IM, it helpfully responds with a message saying &quot;I'm sorry but I don't recognize '&lt;your message here&gt;'. Type 'help' to get a list of the commands I do recognize.&quot;</p>
<p>The second contributing factor is Twitter's habit of sending a message saying &quot;Whoops! Your message was too long. You can only send 140 characters at a time.&quot; if you send overly long tweets.</p>
<p>The third was that <a class="reference external" href="http://www.al3x.net">Alex</a>, in an attempt to make my debugging effort easier, was nice enough to whitelist the bot so that it's not subject to any of Twitter's abuse-prevention routines. See where this is going?</p>
<p>The bot was only up for about ten seconds, but in that time it sent an overly long message to Twitter, which responded with a message about how it couldn't send a message that long, to which the bot responded that it didn't understand a message of the format &quot;your message is too long&quot;. But of course that was also too long. And that's when your cell phone went crazy.</p>
<p>So! Needless to say, I'll be a little more careful going forward. Please don't stop following DCist (I need you there for testing!), but please do turn off SMS updates from it until the app launches.</p>

A few worked fine, but I was left trying to make awkward solder bridges for the rest. My soldering skills aren't all that great by nerd standards, and my Radioshack iron leaves a lot to be desired. I'd already scorched the chip by the time I swooped in with some clippers to remove a misplaced solder strand, had the metal bond to the clippers and proceeded to pull up a sizable trace from the modchip. Whoops.</p>
<p>The good news is that the reassembled Wii seems to be fine despite now containing four fewer screws. But the removed modchip took a solder pad with it, so that's it for this console: it's now officially unmoddable — at least by someone with my meager skills. If some incredibly awesome homebrew or emulation project debuts that I can't live without, I'll have to buy another Wii. Ah well.</p>

                    <p>I've got a technical question for you. The demise of Oink and my rapidly-depleting server disk space have put me in the market for a new Bittorrent solution. I'm not up to administering a properly RAIDed box (getting it to email me when a disk fails is just too much of a pain, given the difficulty of sending mail out from a consumer ISP connection). And having a constantly-running PC fan in the living room is kind of annoying.</p>
<p>What I'd really like is to buy a <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network-attached_storage">network-attached storage</a> device that has Bittorrent baked in. Something with <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAID">RAID</a> that'd sit quietly and download stuff, and that doesn't cost too much money. There's <a class="reference external" href="http://www.buy.com/prod/fantom-drives-g-force-megadisk-nas-raid-1tb-ethernet-with-shadow/q/loc/101/205541427.html">this thing</a>, which looks promising but has so-so customer reviews — folks say it's kind of loud and has flaky firmware. <a class="reference external" href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822107002">This</a> is a bit pricier — you have to supply the disks, and I haven't got spare SATA drives lying around — but <a class="reference external" href="http://www.engadget.com/2007/06/08/qnaps-latest-bittorrent-nas-ts-109-pro-turbo-station/">apparently supports BT</a>.</p>
<p>I imagine there's a third option: get a cheaper, dumber RAID NAS and figure out a way to run BT on my router. It <a class="reference external" href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=21595">looks like</a> this is possible with a custom firmware, but perhaps only with the user-unfriendly OpenWRT. Given how little I can find online about this subject (and the fact that I've only used DD-WRT and Sveasoft before), I'm a little wary of trying it.</p>
<p>So what do you say, internets? Any suggestions?</p>

                    <p>NBC Direct's DRM may be a tougher nut to crack, not least of all because of its insistence on using IE on XP. I don't have an XP machine, and IE precludes the reliable mix of Firefox plugins that makes pulling apart website behavior a breeze. You can accomplish the same thing with other tools, but it's a much bigger pain in the ass.</p>
<p>At any rate, here's the XML that a properly authenticated request will return. As you can see, there's not much useful here — I was hoping for a URL or encrypted key, but no such luck.

                    <p>Over the weekend I briefly considered writing a FaceBot to take the reins of my completely-neglected FaceBook account. I have no interest in logging in and grappling with my acquaintances' neverending lycanthropic demands. But it shouldn't be too hard to write a script that does, thereby proving that I exist as a social entity. For an extra layer of authenticity the bot would watch the RSS coming out of Google News and periodically create a new group with a title like &quot;WE WILL NEVER FORGET YOU Musharraf Declares Martial Law&quot;.</p>
<p>The possibilities were endless. But then I remembered that I'm supposed to be doing a million other things, several of them arguably more important.</p>
<p>Besides, I'm growing convinced that Flickr's already implemented this sort of breakthrough technology. Check out these comments, all of which I've received in the last week:</p>

                    <p>I was making my usual rounds of anti-telco, pro-neutrality, red-meat-servin' blogs the other day when I came across this <a class="reference external" href="http://techdirt.com/articles/20071030/100621.shtml">proposal from TechDirt's Mike Masnick</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
[H]ere's a simple suggestion for mobile operators: Be the first to be totally upfront about your plans and services, remove any high pressure sales techniques, stop making it difficult to compare plans, phones and service and dub yourself as the customer friendly mobile operator. Then see what happens. Of course, some mobile operators have taken steps in this direction over the years. They're a lot more open about where various deadspots are than before and they've tried to be more open about specific features and plans -- but the problem is that this &quot;secretive&quot; mentality exists up and down throughout the organization. If a company makes it clear policy from top to bottom that openness, clarity and customer satisfaction are keys, it would capture the interest of an awful lot of people.</blockquote>
<p>The same criticism could be leveled against Comcast for their recent Bittorrent-throttling antics or their not-actually-unlimited plans. And Comcast would be just as likely to take the advice to be upfront and forthright as the mobile operators are, which is to say not at all. You can see the reason for this in the <a class="reference external" href="http://techdirt.com/article.php?sid=20071030/100621#c13">very first comment</a> left on Mike's post, which appears to have been authored by a defensive employee of the cellular industry:</p>
<blockquote>
If you don't like wireless companies it is simple...this is not a commodity or necessity of life such as water or power, this is a instrument that you choose to purchase and pay for. If you don't like it, don't buy it.</blockquote>
<p>I think that this demonstrates the problem with the cable companies, the mobile companies, the record companies and (before they decided they wanted to be Google without the technology or marketshare) AOL, too: they don't understand or won't admit the nature of what it is that they're actually selling. It's not what the commenter thinks.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, there are only two ways to make money by selling data to consumers. First, you can sell the signal: a catchy song, a fascinating print article, an entertaining video — you make it and you charge for access. It's a pretty straightforward way of earning a living. Second, you can sell the delivery: you can charge for transmuting and transporting the signal into a location and form that's easy for consumers to use.</p>
<p>These both used to be noble and lucrative fields of endeavor. The world will always have an appetite for original creative works. For a while it looked like the same could be said of novel methods of data delivery: radio was great, television was better, the telephone turned out to be pretty handy, and recorded music attracted something of a following. It seemed like the world had a bottomless appetite for new, increasingly efficient and ever-more specialized methods of delivering signals to consumers via enormous, capital-intensive infrastructures.</p>
<p>But it didn't! Digital technology arrived and the world, while hungrier for content than ever, found that it preferred a steady diet of packets. The arrival of cheap and incredibly flexible signal processors on our desktops and in our entertainment centers made the old, centralized and largely analog infrastructure increasingly unnecessary. The development of information theory let us identify and draw very close to the theoretical maximum efficiency for signal transmission.</p>
<p>These days any signal can be made into packets, and we've pretty much figured out the best ways to move those packets. All that's left is to do the actual moving. That's the business the aforementioned companies are in: they ship bits.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, as Nicholas Negroponte <a class="reference external" href="http://web.media.mit.edu/%7Enicholas/Wired/WIRED4-09.html">noted</a>, &quot;Shipping bits [is] a crummy business.&quot; That's because bits are a commodity.</p>
<p>It must be pretty awful to wake up one day and suddenly realize that you're in a commodity business. As a software developer I've at least had a taste of it — it was unsettling to realize that an army of developers in Bangalore could churn out code better than I could, dollar for dollar. I had fooled myself into believing that what I was selling was so extraordinary and great that people would be begging — <em>begging!</em> — for me to deign to craft some SQL and PHP on their behalf. Such a rarified gift! Such a technical artiste!</p>
<p>When you realize that you're selling a mere commodity your ability to profit (and extract rents) from your cleverness is severely limited. It won't help to roll out an ad campaign or make the product mint-scented. You can't differentiate your product from your competitors'. It's all pretty much the same. The users can't tell the difference. All you can do is sell as much of it as you can while spending as little money as possible.</p>
<p>It's probably pretty hard to show off all of the fascinating things you learned in business school if all you're selling is bits. Rather than face this fact, the signal-deliverers choose to delude themselves and their customers. They use their existing market position to sign exclusive deals with content providers, forcing consumers to stick with Sprint if they want to see NFL highlights on their phones, or AOL if they want to hear Ted Leo cover <em>Since U Been Gone</em>, or visit <a class="reference external" href="http://www.hulu.com/">Hulu</a> if they want to watch their favorite show. They fool themselves into thinking that it isn't their lingering monopolistic power that keeps the money coming in, but rather their unique talent for both running a cable company AND reinventing Tivo, or managing the production of television series AND building a YouTube competitor. Somehow, they maintain, it just happens that the sole firm allowed to provide these services is also the one best positioned to provide them efficiently.</p>
<p>Data is now a utility, just like the gas and electric lines running into your house. The present situation is as if the gas company gave customers specialized ovens that could only heat up prepared meals bought from the utility — and refused to connect the gas line to any other kind of oven. It's ludicrous. We don't want their ovens or meals or online music portals or mobile video platforms. We just need them to get out of the way of the original signal, then shuttle the bits we ask for as cheaply as possible.</p>
<p>But if the bit-movers admitted this they'd also be admitting that they're less necessary than before — that there's going to be fewer of them, and that they're going to be making less money. That's not the sort of thing that a corporation is eager to recognize. Nor is there an advantage to being the first to recognize it: there's still good money to be made squeezing the last dregs from this dying business model, and rocking the boat will only hasten everybody's inevitable demise. Who knows, you might get lucky and make it to retirement before the whole thing collapses. Might as well give it a shot.</p>
<p>So I think Mike's proposal isn't very feasible. It's not a question of a needing a company to step forward and begin treating its customers with honesty and respect; it's a question of needing an industry to admit that it's less relevant than it used to be and quietly retire to a life of unassuming, unexciting competence. And that wouldn't be much fun at all.</p>

                    <p>There's a new version of the Hy/pe Mac/hine! Cool. The mp3 blog aggregator's gotten a new coat of paint and a different flash player. It looks pretty nice, although I'm not entirely sure what substantive changes have been made. Nevertheless, it's at least much more t-shirt-compatible.</p>
<p>I decided to celebrate the occasion by digging into the workings of the site a bit more. Hype/m provides a lot of music but is understandably hesitant to provide direct downloads lest they be busted by The Man. But how do you go about providing an mp3 for listening but not for saving? It's as fundamentally unsolvable as any other DRM problem — more so, given the relatively open technologies that the site uses.</p>
<p>Still, they do their best. For instance, only requests from known web browsers are allowed — try to use a command-line tool like wget or curl to fetch content and you'll get an ACCESS DENIED message. But it's easy to fake user agent strings (or just to do the dirty work within your browser). Consequently, this isn't the only security that the site employs.</p>
<p>Let's have a look at the anatomy of playing a song on hypem:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">You click the play button next to a track.</p>
</li>
<li><div class="first line-block">
<div class="line">An AJAX request is sent that looks something like this:</div>

</blockquote>
<p>The part in bold is an identifier that's unique to the song you requested.</p>

<li><div class="first line-block">

<p>This code tells the browser to load an Adobe Flash object called <em>h2p.swf</em> and pass it parameters telling it A) to start playing immediately (<em>autoplay=1</em>) and B) where to find the mp3 that it should play. This is accomplished via a mysterious <em>url</em> parameter, which I've highlighted in bold in the HTML above.</p>
</li>
<li><div class="first line-block">
<div class="line">Using the <a class="reference external" href="http://livehttpheaders.mozdev.org/">LiveHTTPHeaders</a> plugin for Firefox, we can see that the flash video then requests a file named something like:</div>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://hypem.com/serve/f/509/401678/f48c7f07a821a8fc528842d0bd8d3029.mp3">http://hypem.com/serve/f/509/401678/f48c7f07a821a8fc528842d0bd8d3029.mp3</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's straightforward enough. But how does it get that long URL from the even-longer <em>url</em> querystring parameter that's passed to the Flash movie?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>To find out, we've got to take a look inside the seemingly black box of the flash movie. Fortunately there's a great tool that lets us do that: <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nowrap.de/flare.html">Flare</a>, which is free, cross-platform, and will happily extract the ActionScript from a Flash movie. I grabbed the h2p.swf file and passed it to Flare. Here's the interesting part of what I got back:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="literal-block">
this.m = new mp(this, com.meychi.ascrypt.RC4.decrypt(com.meychi.ascrypt.Base64.decode(_root.url), 'abcdef1234567890'));
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Hello there... looks an awful lot like a decryption routine... and something that looks suspiciously like a decryption key! This line takes the aforementioned <em>url</em> querystring parameter, Base64-decodes it, then passes it to an RC4 decryption routine along with the decryption key <em>abcdef1234567890</em> (not the actual key). This turns the <em>url</em> parameter into a usable URL, which the flash player then fetches.</p>
<p>The meychi.ascrypt library's website is offline, but a little digging into its code (also returned by Flare) shows that, unlike most RC4 decryption libraries, it expects to receive a string of hexadecimal bytes which it first converts into a string of chars before applying the RC4 decryption algorithm. The need for this extra step had me scratching my head for a while, but eventually I figured out what was going on and cobbled together the following script to replicate the functionality. It's in Perl, since I couldn't find any RC4 routines in Ruby.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="literal-block">
#!/usr/bin/perl
use MIME::Base64;
use Crypt::RC4;
# hype mac/hine's secret encryption cipher... shhh!
$passphrase = 'abcdef1234567890';
if($src = &lt;&gt;)
{
# decode the URL-safe parameter from base64
$unencoded_src = decode_base64($src);
# convert decoded input from hexadecimal bytes to a string of chars
$charred_ciphertext = '';
while(length($unencoded_src)&gt;0)
{
$char = substr($unencoded_src, 0, 2);
$charred_ciphertext .= chr(hex($char));
$unencoded_src = substr($unencoded_src,2);
}
# decrypt with RC4 algorithm
print RC4($passphrase,$charred_ciphertext);
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Pipe the <em>url</em> querystring parameter to that script and it'll spit out the URL of the actual file. Paste that into your browser and you'll be redirected to the file's actual location — your browser will begin downloading it quite happily.</p>
<p>Of course, this is all kind of a huge pain in the ass. It's much easier to follow the link to the blog where hype/m first found the mp3 and keep your fingers crossed that the original link is still alive. But! If you could just find Javascript libraries for <a class="reference external" href="http://www.webtoolkit.info/javascript-base64.html">Base64 encoding</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://home.versatel.nl/MAvanEverdingen/Code/">RC4 decryption</a> you could make a bookmarklet or Greasemonkey script that automatically adds a direct download link to every hype/m entry. Hmmmmm.</p>
<p>Anyway, I should probably finish by saying that none of this should be taken as an indictment of the hype/m programmers' skills. The Hype Ma/chine is a truly impressive piece of software, and the countermeasures its creators have implemented to prevent direct downloading are pretty much everything I can think of doing. The problem is simply that allowing a user to hear content but not store it is an impossible task. And keeping secrets hidden in Flash — which is the only appropriate technology for this application — is similarly impossible, making whatever obfuscation they employ relatively easy to unravel.</p>
<p>The only improvement I can think to make would be to rotate encryption keys by serving a variety of different player SWFs, and invalidating an mp3's URL as soon as an incorrect key is used (I assume that the URLs produced by my script are temporary redirects that rotate fairly frequently and can be expired as necessary). This way a user couldn't cycle through the known keys. As far as I know, decompiling an SWF is not something that can be accomplished in Javascript.</p>
<p>But it probably <em>could</em> be done within a full-on Firefox plugin. And given browsers' enthusiasm for caching Flash (and Javascript's ability to easily differentiate SWFs with different names), the above proposal might not be a viable approach at all. Really, there's no way to completely secure this system. &quot;Good enough&quot; is all that one can reasonably hope for, and I think they've already achieved that.</p>

<blockquote>
Kay Steiger, who went on the apple-picking trip Sara (pictured above, at the orchard) organized last weekend and that I attended under the time-honored principle &quot;go apple-picking when your girlfriend tells you to,&quot; retorts that apple picking's not inefficient, it's &quot;a form of entertainment.&quot; This would be a lot more convincing were agricultural labor entertaining. In reality, these are the jobs Americans won't do.</blockquote>
<p>But while Matt (and, one suspects, professional apple pickers) thinks it's silly to pay to perform this sort of labor — even if just with time — he's guilty of doing the same thing. Sure, he's a professional pundit <em>now</em>. But for a long time Matt belonged to the class of folks offering electronic ruminations for free — a practice that leaves a lot of professional writers scratching their heads. It's still not unusual to read a curmudgeonly journalist complaining about these damn kids writing without compensation. And while Matt may have done it as an investment in his future, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.dailykos.com/section/Diary">not everyone does</a>.</p>
<p>But writing and gardening are both at least conceivable as leisure activities. An even more astounding example of the reach of this phenomenon comes from <a class="reference external" href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/2007/10/08">Penny Arcade</a>, via <a class="reference external" href="http://bayes.wordpress.com/2007/10/08/brain-in-a-vatsim/">Quantum of a Wantum</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
There are a bunch of people in their basements playing Flight Simulator, and a bunch of people in their basements pretending to be air traffic controllers, running an application that simulates a radarscope. All wearing USB headsets, they are connected to a big network called VATSIM where they talk to each other and simulate realistic air traffic procedures as accurately as possible.</blockquote>
<p>It's strange but true! These people labor over hour-long preflight checklists, pore over FAA manuals and file flight plans before launching their virtual jumbo jets into the virtual sky and then sitting patiently as autopilot sends them across the virtual Atlantic. They create imaginary airlines and imaginary regulatory agencies. It sounds incredibly tedious to me, but I'm sure they genuinely love it.</p>
<p>Of course, crowdsourced air traffic control is probably a somewhat less practical idea than user-generated fruit harvests. But it's not hard to conceive of situations where that sort of energy and enthusiasm for tedium could be harnessed. And it's undeniable that a lot of people are expending considerable effort online creating genuine wealth without direct compensation. Some of this is being harnessed and even occasionally rewarded — open source software's sponsorship by big businesses like IBM and Novell is a good example. And various ventures are now trying to capitalize on the potential of crowdsourcing and UGC, with varying levels of success. But in many more cases it seems to be enough for authors to simply be allowed to create — so long as they continue to receive a sort of involuntary patronage from their regular employers.</p>
<p>In the past you could prove your mettle and gain entry to an industry via skillful amateur efforts, freely offered. The internet now makes it possible for those amateur efforts to actually compete with the industry they're emulating. One can't help but wonder if it's a race to the bottom: do your real job less efficiently to free up time for your fake job. Meanwhile, your willingness to do your fake job for free reduces the compensation available for doing that sort of work, making it harder to actually become a professional. The first movers will be fine, but eventually their fields will be bled dry.</p>
<p>But this is a pretty depressing perspective, and not at all in keeping with my general internet triumphalism. Explanations why I'm wrong will be welcomed with open arms.</p>
<p><strong>OH YEAH!</strong> I nearly forgot: I wrote about related issues in somewhat rosier terms <a class="reference external" href="/2007/04/20/giant-nazi-robots/">a while ago</a>.</p>

I've certainly seem freely-available content redistributed through pirate channels before.</p>

<p>But in this case he may actually be right. Oink doesn't have it, although I suppose that makes some sense given that downloading an album from Oink comes at a cost (users have to maintain an upload/download ratio to keep their access to the site). But Isohunt hasn't got <em>In Rainbows</em> either. Huh.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> <a class="reference external" href="http://strangebirdlabs.com/">Rich</a> pointed out in comments that the band's preselling the downloads, but that nobody's actually got the files yet.

                    <p>C|Net's got a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cnet.com/8301-13739_1-9781162-46.html">very good writeup</a> of the situation that owners of hacked iPhones face now that Steve Jobs has said Apple won't simply tolerate their antics. It's unclear how diligent Apple will actually be when it comes to fighting this battle — Jobs is very good at sounding soothing and then delivering nothing — but it seems likely that Apple will at least make a superficial effort to make life difficult for the more high-profile sources of phone-hacking software.</p>
<p>None of this is likely to matter much to iPhone users who know how to use Bittorrent and IRC, however. If Apple got serious about the effort I could imagine users getting locked out of firmware upgrades and iTunes use (lest they lose their hacked functionality permanently). AT&amp;T might also start preventing nonstandard apps from using their network. The former seems likely to me; the latter, not so much.</p>

So there's a little thrill of excitement that occurs when you find what appears to be a genuine bug in a high-profile part of it. But that thrill is tempered when you realize that a) your clients don't care about the exotic nature of the problem, as they have already launched their website against your recommendation and b) all of the people who could help you appear to currently be on <a class="reference external" href="http://barcelona2007.drupalcon.org/">planes to Barcelona</a>.</p>
<p>So I reproduce my plaintive IRC begging here not because I think it's likely to help (I know some Drupal hax0rs extraordinaire, but I don't think they're subscribed). No, this is just me crying out to the universe.</p>

<div class="line">I've got a really weird issue with Views and profile fields. Essentially, a profile-heavy view intermittently stops returning any records. Resaving the view typically resolves the problem -- for a while. I haven't been able to determine the event that causes the view to break again, but it always does. Looking at the results from views_build_view('queries',..), it's clear that sometimes the module is forgetting to repeatedly join the query against profile_values.</div>

                    <p>My apologies, internet. I was being a pretty good blogger for a while there, but this week's looking rough. I'd desperately like to write a convoluted apologia on behalf of Bear Grylls, or explain how a pigeon almost killed me, or emphatically agree that <a class="reference external" href="http://pygmalioninablanket.blogspot.com/2007/08/finally-real-summer-movie.html">dragons are awesome</a>. But for now all that will have to wait. Instead, please accept some bulleted items of a technical nature.</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">Item the first! I received my <a class="reference external" href="http://eng.supercard.cn/">SuperCard</a> in the mail at long last. I'll explain the nefarious things it allows me to do with my gameboy later. For now, suffice it to say that the marginal cost of an experience point just plummeted.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Tim's recently had a few great posts about the First Sale Doctrine and whether software companies can bind you to contractual terms by printing them on a tiny sheet of paper that you throw out, unread, with the rest of the packaging for Office 2007. His <a class="reference external" href="http://www.techliberation.com/archives/042750.php">latest</a> is particularly interesting — in it he responds to a criticism involving open source software and its own reliance on software licenses. I think Tim's second point in response is on the money: the use of compiled software is very different from the use of source code.
Besides, there's no real reason why a more explicit contractual agreement couldn't be imposed on the distribution of open source code. Tim has noted that Microsoft could make you sign a contract to buy Windows, too, but doesn't because it would end up costing them money (and make consumers more aware of the terms of the agreements).
But the vast majority of open source developers know about the licenses associated with their hobby, even if they can't explain the differences between the GPL, BSD, Apache, Mozilla and LGPL licenses off the top of their heads. I don't think too many lines of code would be lost by requiring some sort of deliberate acknowledgment of a project's license prior to downloading its source.
But this may all be irrelevant. I'm no lawyer, but my general impression is that the exchange of money can significantly alter a legal landscape — it certainly does in other areas of intellectual property law. I'm not sure whether that works for or against open source evangelists in this case, but I think it's plausible to say that they may occupy a different legal position than that of commercial software vendors.</p>

<li><p class="first">Also at Tech Liberation, Adam Thierer <a class="reference external" href="http://www.techliberation.com/archives/042749.php">writes about wifi piggybacking</a>. I already left a lengthy comment there, so if you want to hear my ruminations on the subject you can follow the link. But more practically, I wanted to say that it's really, really easy to set up a connection-sharing arrangement. I recently installed the custom DD-WRT firmware on Emily's router and set it to repeat Scooter's signal (he'd okayed the project at the beginning of the summer). Aside from some <a class="reference external" href="http://www.bitsum.com/openwiking/owbase/ow.asp?WRT54G5_CFE">router-specific difficulties</a> that won't be relevant for anyone following the directions below, it worked like a charm.
So if you can get a willing neighbor's faint signal by the window and nowhere else, you might want to think about buying a router to handle the window-sitting for you. It's pretty simple to do:</p>
</p><ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Go to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Supported_Devices">this page</a> and figure out what the cheapest compatible router is, then buy it. Plan on spending about $50.</li>
<li>Follow <a class="reference external" href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Installation">these instructions</a>, which will guide you through downloading and installing the DD-WRT firmware onto your router. To set up the router as a repeater you'll need to use the v24 release of the firmware, which is still considered beta-quality.</li>
<li>Use <a class="reference external" href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Universal_Wireless_Repeater">these directions</a> to configure your newly-powerful router into a wireless repeater. It even works with encrypted networks! Well, provided that you have the password. Still, it's incredibly useful and seems to be quite speedy and stable based on my admittedly not-quite-rigorous testing.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Finally, an <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cnet.com/8301-13739_1-9769645-46.html">interesting but almost certainly specious argument</a> stating that Comcast's specific anti-Bittorrent measures may be illegal.</p>

                    <p>Cord Blomquist wonders this, among other things, over at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.techliberation.com/archives/042725.php">Tech Liberation</a>, saying:</p>
<blockquote>
Does AT&amp;T, Apple, or both companies have a legal case to bring against the hackers? Likely.</blockquote>
<p>Actually, it's pretty hard to say right now. There are a few types of legislation that are relevant here. The first is the odious DMCA, a law that forbids device owners from circumventing &quot;technological measures that control access to copyrighted works&quot;. Copyfighting geeks feel that if you buy a device it should belong to you and you should be free to do with it as you please. If the vendor set its price with the assumption that you'd be stuck buying ringtones or printer ink or razorblades exclusively from them, well, too bad. The DMCA provides legal protection for the aforementioned business model.</p>
<p>However, unlocking a cell phone happens to be a special case: it's one of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.copyright.gov/1201/">six current exemptions to the DMCA</a> granted by the Library of Congress.</p>
<blockquote>
Computer programs in the form of firmware that enable wireless telephone handsets to connect to a wireless telephone communication network, when circumvention is accomplished for the sole purpose of lawfully connecting to a wireless telephone communication network.</blockquote>
<p>Apple may still have some claim against the iPhone hackers. That's because circumvention devices typically employ code that's the property of the device designer. Unless I'm mistaken, the DMCA exemption doesn't grant anyone the right to use or redistribute others' code. It's also possible that circumventing the protection may necessitate the violation of patents held by the device designer.</p>
<p>A similar situation exists in the world of Xbox modding. <a class="reference external" href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/07/08/02/Feds-raid-video-game-modders-in-16-states_1.html">Until recently</a> it was easy to buy a modchip online. Properly installed, this allows you to turn your Xbox into a device that can run Linux, emulate older consoles, or act as a media center (and, yes, you can play pirated games, too).</p>
<p>But you can't do this with the chip when it first arrives in the mail. Although the device is (or was) legal on its own terms, it couldn't unlock the full potential of the Xbox without running custom firmware — firmware that was based on code to which Microsoft owns the copyright. Consequently most modchips shipped with a firmware based on Linux called <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cromwell_(computing)">Cromwell</a>. This was built without using copyrighted code and could be legally distributed. But it wasn't capable of doing much besides booting Linux and replacing itself with new firmware loaded from a burned CD.</p>
<p>If a modchip user wanted to use his or her Xbox for other applications they'd have to hunt through the wilds of IRC to obtain the forbidden firmware. In fact, the chips would ship with detailed instructions about soldering and firmware replacement. But when you got to the part about finding alternate firmware, the manual would adopt a &quot;you didn't hear it from us&quot; sort of tone and direct the user to various websites and chatrooms that the chip manufacturer insisted weren't at all affiliated with their operation.</p>
<p>It's all a bit ridiculous. But this is the situation that Xbox owners faced, and one which may be applicable to iPhone owners, too. Until the courts or congress decide exactly what ownership of an electronic device means we'll increasingly find ourselves in these strange legal landscapes.</p>

                    <p>I realized I might as well post this script, too. Say you're moving from one host to another, and the source exports to the MT/Typepad format (a big long text file) and the new host can read that format (<a class="reference external" href="http://wordpress.org/docs/tutorials/import-mt/">Wordpress can</a>, and of course MT/Typepad can).</p>
<p>You're facing a problem: your entries' text is probably littered with images and links pointing at your old domain. Those links are presumably going to become dead sometime after the transition; you'd like to rewrite them to point at the new domain. You'd also like to download any images, PDFs or other digital assets that they point to, then upload them to the new server.</p>
<p>Well, here's a script that you can run against the exported MT/Typepad file:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="literal-block">
#!/usr/bin/perl
my $url, $rewritten_url;
while(my $l = &lt;&gt;)
{
while($l =~ m/(href|src)=['&quot;](http:\/\/beutler\.typepad\.com\/.*?)['&quot;]/i)
{
$url = $2;
$rewritten_url = $url;
$rewritten_url =~ s/http:\///igx;
if($url =~ m/\.(html?|php)/i)
{
$rewritten_url =~ s/^\/beutler\.typepad\.com\/home//igx;
$rewritten_url =~ s/\.(html?|php)$/\//i;
}
else
{
my $prefix = $rewritten_url;
$prefix =~ s/^\///;
$prefix =~ s/\/[^\/]+$//;
`wget -q --directory-prefix=$prefix $url`;
}
$l =~ s/$url/$rewritten_url/gx;
}
print $l;
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>If you saved this file as <em>rewrite_entries.pl</em>, you'd run it like so:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="literal-block">
cat MT_EXPORT_FILE.txt | ./rewrite_entries.pl &gt; MT_EXPORT_FILE_REWRITTEN.txt
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>You'd end up with a new text file (which is the one you should import) and a subdirectory full of images and PDFs that you'll want to FTP up to your new server. There's some Brian-specific stuff in the above script, but it shouldn't take very much work to adapt it to a different site.</p>

                    <p>Here's a sort-of-interesting problem I've been working on recently, and which might help prevent an internet stranger or two from pulling their hair out. When you're moving from one blog to another, how do you set things up so that folks stumbling across your old site are sent to the new one? This came up while Emily and I were working on <a class="reference external" href="http://brianbeutler.com">Brian's new site</a>. His existing Typepad site had URLs like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<a class="reference external" href="http://beutler.typepad.com/home/2007/08/rove-the-erudit.html">http://beutler.typepad.com/home/2007/08/rove-the-erudit.html</a></blockquote>
<p>I knew that I wanted to clean up the formatting of these a little bit — for one thing, the .html would have to go, as I intended to use some PHP in the pages (on a web server with a standard configuration, only files ending in .php or .php5 are processed for PHP). And that &quot;/home/&quot; seemed extraneous, too.</p>
<p>I did try to make the two similar, though, to simplify things. By default Movable Type creates its URLs from the entry's title, transforming it into a unique identifier called the basename. I altered MT's default basename length so that it was 15 characters, matching the length of Typepad's basenames. I set up the new mapping in MT's Settings/Publishing area, and ended up with new URLs that looked like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.brianbeutler.com/2007/08/rove_the_erudit/index.php">http://www.brianbeutler.com/2007/08/rove_the_erudit/index.php</a></blockquote>
<p>The index.php on the end can be left off — if you ask a Linux web server for a directory, it'll look for &quot;index.php&quot; or &quot;index.html&quot; or &quot;index.htm&quot; and send it back if it finds it. This lets you have slightly tidier-looking URLs. So our new URL is actually:</p>
<blockquote>
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.brianbeutler.com/2007/08/rove_the_erudit/">http://www.brianbeutler.com/2007/08/rove_the_erudit/</a></blockquote>
<p>With the format settled upon I was able to write some code that sits on every page of Brian's Typepad site. When a user arrives the page looks at its URL, applies a set of transformations to rewrite it into the new format, and sends the user to the result. Normally you'd want to do this in a server-side script or .htaccess file, but as far as I can tell Typepad doesn't let its users have that level of control. So I had to put it in some Javascript that I added to Brian's Typepad template:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="literal-block">
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;
location.href = location.href.replace(/beutler\.typepad\.com/,'www.brianbeutler.com').replace(/\/home\//,'/').replace(/\.html$/,'/').replace(/\-/g,'_');
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>This looks complicated, but it really just does a few things to the URL (whatever the URL may be):</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Replace &quot;beutler.typepad.com&quot; with &quot;www.brianbeutler.com&quot;</li>
<li>Replace &quot;/home/&quot; with &quot;/&quot;</li>
<li>Replace the &quot;.html&quot; at the end of the URL with &quot;/&quot;</li>
<li>Change all hyphens in the URL to underscores</li>
</ol>
<p>It then sends the browser to the new URL.</p>
<p>Done! All I had to do now is deliver the website, lean back and adopt an attitude of extreme self-satisfaction.</p>
<p>Except... no. I wasn't done. Everything was actually much, much worse than I thought.</p>
<p>I was a little slow to catch on. Brian started receiving emails from readers who were getting 404 errors. The redirection script was sending people to the wrong places.</p>
<p>Brian's got a bunch of regular features with names that start similarly (or are identical). This creates a problem when trying to create unique basenames for each one. Movable Type and Typepad both have systems for dealing with these situations in a way that ensures each basename is distinct — if two entries are both called &quot;xyz&quot;, the second one's basename will be &quot;xyz_1&quot;, or something aong those lines. But these systems don't behave in quite the same way — or at least they don't when one system has its entries imported and the other has them authored over a period of time.</p>
<p>This resulted in situations like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><strong>Typepad&nbsp;URL:</strong>&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://beutler.typepad.com/home/2007/08/almost-daily--4.html">http://beutler.typepad.com/home/2007/08/almost-daily--4.html</a></div>
<div class="line"><strong>Rewritten&nbsp;URL:</strong>&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.brianbeutler.com/2007/08/almost_daily__4/">http://www.brianbeutler.com/2007/08/almost_daily__4/</a></div>
<div class="line"><strong>Actual&nbsp;New&nbsp;URL:</strong>&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.brianbeutler.com/2007/08/almost_daily_co_73/">http://www.brianbeutler.com/2007/08/almost_daily_co_73/</a></div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>The first one is the old URL. The second one is the rewritten URL, created using the code above. And the third is the <em>actual</em> URL — the one that we need to redirect to.</p>
<p>There's another problem, too. Typepad creates an entry's basename the first time you save it, even if you haven't yet published it. The basename is created from the title, as I mentioned. But if the title changes, the basename does not. However, when you import those entries into Movable Type, it recreates the basename from whatever the title ended up being. Which results in the following mess:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><strong>Typepad&nbsp;URL:</strong>&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://beutler.typepad.com/home/2007/07/h20.html">http://beutler.typepad.com/home/2007/07/h20.html</a></div>

<div class="line"><strong>Actual&nbsp;New&nbsp;URL:</strong>&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.brianbeutler.com/2007/07/banal_observati_49/">http://www.brianbeutler.com/2007/07/banal_observati_49/</a></div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>So: the redirect is fine for a lot of URLs. It fails for some proportion of URLs. But it's impossible to tell which ones just by looking at the URL, and there's no way to figure out what the new URL ought to be on the basis of the old one.</p>
<p>First things first. Let's figure out which URLs are screwed up. We'll iterate through Brian's Typepad archive pages. For each one we'll grab all of the permalinks. Then we'll rewrite them using the rules implemented by the Javascript above. Finally, we'll test each rewritten URL. If it generates a &quot;page not found&quot; message, we'll spit out some code that'll help us with future analysis (more on that in a sec).</p>
<p>Here we go...</p>

<p>So we've got the Typepad entries exported in an easily-processed format — one that includes the body, date, and information about the URL. Next we need to get the imported Movable Type entries into a similarly useful format. Then we'll write some code that goes through, compares the bodies of the entries and tries to match them up with one another (with the help of the date).</p>
<p>No fancy scripting is required for getting the Movable Type entries. We just need to make a new template in MT that spits out the entries in the format we want:</p>

<p>You might've noticed that despite our initial Perlishness, the entries are being stored in PHP.

<p>Which can be pasted directly into an .htaccess file. Now the Javascript on Typepad will still send users to the wrong URL, but once they arrive at that incorrect URL the server will catch their request and redirect it to the right location.</p>
<p>I've just put it online a moment ago, but it seems to work well. And there was only one entry for which the text-matching produced a score of less than 100% similarity. It was easy enough to catch it and manually set the URL.</p>
<p>Of course, it'd be nice of us to keep all of these redirects somewhere other than .htaccess — we're wasting the web server's resources by making it ponder all of them whenever it wants to serve a page. But as sysadmin sins go this is at least a common one. Given the limits of Typepad, the not-outrageous quantity of redirects and the nonexistent noticeable benefit to doing this 100% cleanly, I didn't bother.</p>
<p>But if you wanted to be really slick about it you could make a custom PHP script with all the redirects your 404 handler — that way the redirection overhead would only be incurred when a file wasn't found. There's probably an extremely slick way to do this conditionally with a RewriteRule, too, but I don't know it off the top of my head.</p>
<p>Anyway, there's complete the tale of my weekend's technical adventures (well, except for buying <a class="reference external" href="http://www.kickgaming.com/supercard-sd-and-superkey-pr-83.html">one of these</a>). Hopefully a weary Typepad refugee will someday stumble across my post and get some use out of it.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Having read a bit more on the subject, it seems very likely that this is a clone of the WiiKey rather than the original chip. That wouldn't normally be a problem unless you were really counting on getting a holographic sticker with your order. But the clones don't come with firmware preinstalled — you have to download it from the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.wiikey.cn">WiiKey website</a>, burn it to a disc and run it in your modded Wii, thereby loading the code on the chip. Unfortunately, Nintendo released a firmware update to the Wii a few weeks ago that made the disc format in which the firmware is encoded nonfunctional. This appears to be a temporary problem — folks have already figured out how to remaster Wii discs so that they can boot. But the WiiKey people haven't yet repackaged their firmware in a format that will work on updated Wiis.</p>
<p>So if you have an official WiiKey chip you already have firmware loaded and are fine. If you buy a clone you'll end up waiting for WiiKey to release a bootable upgrade disc. It's not a big deal, really, but I wouldn't want you to end up marooned. The genuine chip costs about $20 and can be acquired from the vendors listed on the WiiKey website.</p>

It comes complete with a somewhat-irritating but still very informative <a class="reference external" href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/aug07/5480">Flash demonstration</a> of the topic it discusses: how recorded music has become louder and more fatiguing as a result of an arms race between music producers that trades upon our pathetically easily-fooled nervous systems. It's like the omnipresence of corn syrup in processed foods: everyone says they don't like it, but it's hard to argue with figures showing that sweetness = sales.</p>
<p>The article covers a lot of ground, touching on numerous issues related to how audio storage technology works (I had no idea that engineers could alter vinyl's dynamic range during mastering — sort of like adjusting the bitrate on an MP3). Definitely worth a read. And if you have any irritating audiophile friends, you may want to send them the link. If they don't understand the piece, politely tell them to shut up for a bit about how awful digital audio technology is.</p>

                    <p>I might have to reconsider the Ocean: <a class="reference external" href="http://mstem.wordpress.com/">Matt</a> tipped me off to the fact that some intrepid Helio users have <a class="reference external" href="http://www.heliocity.net/2007/opera-mini-for-everybody-custom-apps-yay/">figured out a way to load J2ME apps on the phone</a>. The first big success is Opera Mini, an excellent web browser that can now supplant the Ocean's neutered default browser.</p>
<p>The advance is related to a wrapper that's been written for the platform. Lots of phones can run Java Midlets, and consequently lots of Midlets are available. But Helios can't use them. They employ a less-common Java technology called WIPI. That's the crux of the breakthrough: someone's come up with a way to wrap Midlets as WIPI apps. There are kinks to be worked out (the QWERTY keyboard on the Ocean doesn't work within Opera, for example), but this is clearly a big deal.</p>

                    <p>Comcast has placed new anti-Bittorrent restrictions in place, limiting download speeds and, crucially, preventing those with completed downloads from &quot;seeding&quot; — continuing to contribute to the Bittorrent swarm. Eliminating seeders cripples a swarm; if enough ISPs did it, the efficiency of the protocol would plummet. Many swarms would no longer be viable.</p>
<p>Encryption doesn't seem to help. The protocol's creator, <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bram_Cohen">Bram Cohen</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://torrentfreak.com/interview-with-bram-cohen-the-inventor-of-bittorrent/">warned that BT encryption was a bad and pointless idea</a>, and is being proven right as ISPs like Rogers simply <a class="reference external" href="http://torrentfreak.com/rogers-fighting-bittorrent-by-throttling-all-encrypted-transfers/">throttle all encrypted traffic</a>. There's a <a class="reference external" href="http://torrentfreak.com/comcast-throttles-bittorrent-traffic-seeding-impossible/#comment-148293">workaround for the Comcast measures</a> if you've got a Linux firewall, but of course most folks don't.</p>
<p>Admittedly, this doesn't rank among the greatest injustices in human history. Most of the affected activity involves copyright infringement. But not all. And this issue will become increasingly relevant and legitimized as bandwidth-intensive data services proliferate — movies will be downloaded by your Tivo, game consoles will download ever-larger game demos and add-ons. People will start to notice that ISPs can capriciously degrade service when their accounting departments demand it. And people won't like it.</p>
<p>I think the solution is metered bandwidth. <a class="reference external" href="http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/08/18/1138224&amp;from=rss">The Slashdotters want it, too</a>. Right now the price jump from consumer service to business service is too large — who's going to pay double the price simply for a contract with terms that Comcast actually has to obey? We need more granular pricing, and metered bandwidth is the obvious way to provide it.</p>

But it sounds like the Red Cross has <em>also</em> been misbehaving, licensing the symbol to businesses in a way that's disallowed by an old agreement between the RC and J&amp;J.</p>
<p>I realize that trademarks don't expire in the same way that patents and copyrights do, but surely there's a <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark#Maintaining_trademark_rights_.E2.80.94_abandonment_and_genericide">genericide</a> argument to be made here — I had no idea the red cross belonged to Johnson &amp; Johnson. I thought their mark was the intertwined Js that appear on their products, and that the cross was just generic decoration.</p>
<p>Who knows what the courts will decide. But it seems obvious to me that the symbol belongs in the public domain. Johnson &amp; Johnson shouldn't be dragging charities into court over it, and charities shouldn't be selling licenses that they aren't entitled to grant.</p>

                    <p>I really like reading <a class="reference external" href="http://www.techliberation.com">The Technology Liberation Front</a>, but they're in serious disarray over Google's bid to force the 700 MHz band open. The backstory, for those who haven't been following it: the FCC is about to auction off the last major block of radio frequencies that will become available for ten years or so. They're particularly delicious frequencies, too, able to penetrate buildings and carry lots of information. Google's been lobbying the FCC, hoping that the agency will require some or all of the winning licensees to keep their networks open: they'd have to let new services and devices connect instead of getting to pick who connects and what services they offer, the way today's cellphone companies do.</p>
<p>This has thrown TLF into a tizzy. They've responded by providing hefty helpings of hand-wringing, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.techliberation.com/archives/042604.php">ludicrous potshots</a>, and, yes, some <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cato.org/tech/tk/070730-tk.html">actually reasonable analyses</a> of the situation.</p>
<p>It's easy to see why they're going nuts over this: their no-regulation ethos naturally favors big companies throwing their weight around. It's the market working! But Google is <em>also</em> a big company. And it's <em>also</em> throwing its weight around. Except this time, the weight is being thrown in the direction favored by those of us who want more regulation — the net neutrality cranks, communists and starry-eyed idealists. It's a very confusing situation for market triumphalists, and it undercuts a whole class of &quot;let 'em play ball&quot; arguments.</p>
<p>Consequently we get posts like <a class="reference external" href="http://www.techliberation.com/archives/042602.php">this one</a>, which is wrong in a number of ways:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Closed networks, or rather networks that aren't wide-open, offer some significant advantages. Security, for one, is markedly enhanced by a closed or limit-access system. That's why our national security system, at least those outside the Pentagon's email servers, are often totally severed from the wide-open internet.</p>
<p>An open network, like the internet itself, is prone to all variety of attacks. By contrast, I've never gotten a cell phone virus, something I owe to my cell carrier's closed system. My phone also seldom crashes, unlike my PC. I owe much of my PC woes to the OS I'm sure, but the various apps I have running are likely not custom made for my particular machine, unlike the apps found on many cell phones.</p>
<p>Let's think different for a moment and consider Apple. Mac has always been a fairly limitedâ€”if not closedâ€”system, yet this walled-garden isn't seen as an evil. That's likely because Macs works so well, but its crucial to recognize that much of this is owed to Mac's closed architecture, something that eliminates many of the variables that plague PCs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's a little funny to see folks that are normally against government paternalism turning around and arguing that we need Verizon to save us from ourselves. But that's basically what Cord Blomquist is saying.</p>
<p>I think he's wrong in a number of ways: cell phones are already more susceptible to dangers Mr. Blomquist is worried about than he realizes. However, the danger is minimal, both for engineering and economic reasons, neither of which are likely to be significantly affected by open networks. And even if they were, the openness of the network would allow consumers to select technologies that avoid these problems, while retaining the windfall in innovation that even Mr. Blomquist acknowledges.</p>
<p>Not all cell phones are closed software platforms. Many cheap ones are, but that's certainly not true of the smart phones that are getting less expensive and more popular — yet you don't hear many complaints about malware from Treo and Windows Mobile users, despite their ability to install third party software without getting permission from their carriers. Nor are the entirely-closed platforms all that secure: there are tons of bluetooth-based attacks out there, and there are a number of exploits already available for the iPhone (most related to vulnerabilities in Safari).</p>
<p>But you don't really have to worry about people taking advantage of them, because while these exploits can be used to annoy a phone's owner, they aren't much good for making money. And it's the entrepreneurial hackers that are the ones you have to fear — folks who enrich themselves with distributed denial of service attacks that hold websites for ransom, or who enslave armies of infected zombie machines to send out untraceable Viagra-hawking spam.</p>
<p>Cell phones aren't a very good target for DDoSing or enlistment in zombie hoards. They're underpowered, connected to slow networks, turned off some of the time, have limited battery life, and are owned by people who will notice a sudden spike in network usage as soon as their monthly bill arrives. Nor are cellphones particularly easy to infect — there's no ActiveX Mobile Edition, they frequently use optimizing proxies, and phones don't have much need for leaving ports open. They've got fewer vectors for infection and fewer capabilities that are useful for evildoers. There's not much reason for a hacker to go after them when easier and more attractive prey is available elsewhere.</p>
<p>On the question of stability, Mr. Blomquist is right about Apple benefiting from a relatively closed system. This is also why game consoles can generally avoid crashing: it's a lot easier to create a stable operating system if you don't have to support every dodgy piece of third-party add-on hardware under the sun. But of course cell phones already do support a few kinds of peripherals — bluetooth headsets and GPS units come to mind. And they already do spread their software systems across diverse hardware platforms, as Palm, Symbian, Windows Mobile and the J2ME stack have to be implemented on varying handsets. And, contrary to Mr. Blomquist's assumption, software developed for phones by third parties is typically created for a generic platform, not a specific handset. Cell phones have competing platforms, processor families and operating systems — the environment surrounding these apps is more similar to the one facing computers than Mr. Blomquist thinks.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that mobiles already have to deal with some hardware and software diversity, but are unlikely to ever have to struggle with the level that's given Windows its awful reputation. And hey, if any device can attach to the network, consumers can just leave a flaky software implementation for a better one — no contract-breaking required! It's the market in action! Doesn't that sound great?</p>
<p>Besides, using the PC as an example of openness gone awry is an odd gambit. Despite what's generally considered to be obviously inferior technology — both in hardware and the software written for it — the openness of PCs translated into such huge advantages in cost and ability to innovate that the platform decimated the competition. Those savings and the computing ubiquity they afforded gave birth to the open source movement and the consumer internet revolution. I love what my Mac does for me, but I'm astounded by what the PC platform did for the world.</p>
<p>But the silliest part comes here:</p>
<blockquote>
While an open wireless network is intriguing and could create a platform for unique innovations, limited networks will still offer stability, compatibility, security, and privacy and should be allowed to compete.</blockquote>
<p>Well, okay, sure. But who's stopping closed networks from competing? They've got huge swaths of network already, and we have scores of mobile vendors; existing players can and will keep their closed systems. If the advantages they offer are as great as Mr. Blomquist maintains, I'm sure they'll be able to carve out a comfortable niche for themselves — perhaps in the same way Apple has.</p>
<p>Yes, I'm sure Google's fighting for open networks for its own selfish reasons. But at the moment Google's interests seem to line up with my own pretty well. So I say we give openness a try. I'm pretty confident that it'll be recognized as hugely advantageous to consumers. I imagine that many of the telcos' advocates think so, too — they wouldn't be complaining half so loudly if they didn't.</p>

It now thinks it's expired shareware, and asserts this fact in a maximally-annoying way: by disabling manual feed refreshes and the &quot;next unread&quot; buttons.

                    <p>Shortly after posting the <a class="reference external" href="/2007/07/12/unfoggedbot/">Unfoggedbot</a> I got this email from <a class="reference external" href="http://wryandstanley.blogspot.com/">Stanley</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
Is there anywhere that Joe Humanities Degree can go to to learn how to do this sort of thing?</blockquote>
<p>Needless to say, this sort of request warms the cockles of my heart (whatever those are). And today, in the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.unfogged.com/archives/week_2007_07_22.html#007222">aftermath</a> of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.unfogged.com/archives/week_2007_07_22.html#007220">various</a> recent <a class="reference external" href="http://www.unfogged.com/archives/week_2007_07_22.html#007219">demonstrations</a> of scripting languages' utility, it might be a good time for me to press my case.</p>
<p>So: yes! Yes, a thousand times yes. You can learn a scripting language, which is the easy way to put together an IM answerbot, or a ballot-stuffing bot, or whatever else. In fact, you not only can but probably should. Scripting languages are a powerful way to control computerized systems. The computerization of the world is obviously nowhere near complete, but it's getting there quickly — and that means that the relevance and power of scripting languages are only going to increase. You can already control various pieces of the physical world with this technology, like lights and thermostats. And if you use Excel or perform repetitive tasks on a computer in your daily life, you can likely save yourself some drudgery with a well-written script. Soon enough your toaster, garage door and television will be accessible through these languages, too.</p>
<p>There will be other ways to control the electronic world, it's true. People will continue to invent visual metaphors like <a class="reference external" href="http://pipes.yahoo.com">Yahoo! Pipes</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://mindstorms.lego.com/eng/default.aspx">Lego Mindstorms</a> that expose some of the capabilities of programming in an accessible way. But we're a long way from the day when these GUIs confer the same power that knowledge of a scripting language affords. Besides, they tend to rely on metaphors that are more easily learned through a text-based programming language.</p>
<p>And that's important. Along with the ability to manipulate the devices and information around you, learning a little programming will help you understand how engineers think. If you familiarize yourself with the sausage-making side of computers you'll begin to develop an intuitive understanding of hardware and software interfaces which, as I mentioned, will comprise a larger and larger portion of the world. You'll never have to be one of those hopeless codgers reduced to asking his or her grandkids for help programming the hyper-VCR.</p>
<p>So how should you approach this worthy undertaking? The best way is probably to pick a scripting language and start perusing the materials that are available. But which scripting language? In some ways it doesn't matter — you'll need to learn what a <em>variable</em> is, how an <em>if..then statement</em> works and what a <em>for loop</em> does in any of them. But you may as well hear the nerd scuttlebutt on each and then make an informed choice. So let's look at the big three first:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Perl</dt>
<dd>Perl's one of the oldest scripting languages still in widespread use, and powered much of the early web. Its biggest advantage is probably <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cpan.org/">CPAN</a>, a massive library of add-ons written by people to handle the hard part of whatever neat thing you want to do, whether it's the creation of an IM bot, manipulating Flickr or the automatic generation of charts. It's also very nice for processing text, which, after all, is what the net is mostly comprised of. And because of its age you can find it preinstalled and available on most webhosts and Unix or Mac systems (it's easy to get running on Windows, too).
The knock on Perl is that it's slow and somewhat byzantine. Most importantly, it's relatively hard to read Perl code (much harder than it is to write it), which makes learning by example difficult. As you may have noticed I use Perl a lot for tasks where speed isn't important, both because I'm used to it and because CPAN makes so many excellent tools available.
If you want to learn Perl, I'd recommend that you start by reading the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.perl.org/books/library.html">freely available PDF of the book Beginning Perl</a>.</dd>
<dt>Ruby</dt>
<dd>It's the cool new kid on the block. Ruby's very chic, and is frequently lauded for producing &quot;beautiful&quot; code. It really is a pretty elegant language. It's also the underpinnings of the Ruby On Rails framework, which is a new and very popular way to get a dynamic, database-driven website up and running with minimal effort. Ruby's cool, and is the next language on my list of things to learn.
But it's still a work in progress. It's a little slow, although that's likely to improve. And its RubyGems package manager system — Ruby's version of CPAN — is easy to use, but not yet all that fleshed out. If you want to talk to Flickr, for instance, you'll find that most of the available Gems have serious limitations. It'll get better, though, and these sorts of problems aren't that relevant for beginners.
There are also particularly great learning tools for Ruby, many of them thanks to one man called Why. You should definitely have a look at <a class="reference external" href="http://tryruby.hobix.com/">Try Ruby</a>, an in-browser demonstration of the language that walks you through a basic tutorial. After that, <a class="reference external" href="http://learnruby.com/why">LearnRuby.com</a> is probably the best clearinghouse for traditional learning materials. But if you like your programming primers weird, illustrated and told through elaborate, nonsensical stories, you should absolutely read <a class="reference external" href="http://poignantguide.net/ruby/">Why's (Poignant) Guide To Ruby</a>. It's definitely the strangest programming book I've ever read.</dd>
<dt>Python</dt>
<dd>Python kind of splits the difference. It's not as old as Perl and not as new as Ruby. It's got a lot of tools available for it, but perhaps not as many as Perl (it's better-designed, though). It's got its own <a class="reference external" href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">hot web development framework</a> — one that's not quite as exciting as Rails but seems to have fewer scaling problems. It can be made blazingly fast when necessary — Google uses Python extensively, and it sort of seems like they know what they're doing.
I don't really care for it, though. I tried to learn Python by writing a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.zunta.org/blog/archives/2006/01/15/learning_is_fun/">series of bloggy tutorials</a> way back when. But not only was I not very good at keeping my instruction properly focused, I also didn't end up liking the language very much. The weird markup bugged me (it controls program flow with whitespace in an unusual way), but the sin for which I'll never forgive Python is its awkward syntax for using regular expressions. Regexes are a common feature across languages, and are an <a class="reference external" href="http://www.zunta.org/blog/archives/2006/02/13/files_and_regul/">incredibly powerful way to process text</a>. Python requires a preparatory step before using them; Perl and Ruby don't. For that reason I'm unlikely to dive back into Python.
<a class="reference external" href="http://waste.typepad.com/">Wolfson</a> loves it, though. You may want to talk to him if you're interested in the language — I'm sure he can make a better case for it, and point you toward good resources for learning it.</dd>
</dl>
<p>As I said, those are the big three. There are countless others, but these are the ones that you'll run into the most. They're used all the time to process data and glue applications together. Any one of them would be a fine choice.</p>
<p>But there are a couple of less conventional options that I think you may want to consider, too:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>AppleScript</dt>
<dd>If you have a Mac, you have AppleScript. I don't know it myself, but it's an extremely readable language designed to let you automate tasks on your Mac. The applications it lets you control will be immediately familiar — you'll be able to fetch a webpage with Safari rather than, say, wget or curl. Consequently you may be able to perform impressive feats more quickly than you would with a more general-purpose language. <a class="reference external" href="http://files.macscripter.net/sourcebook/AS4ASb2.pdf">This PDF</a> seems like a good place to start.</dd>
<dt>PHP</dt>
<dd>PHP is widely-used, but generally in a web context (&quot;Hypertext Processor&quot; makes up the final two thirds of the acronym). If you buy a cheap webhosting account, it probably comes with PHP. This entry exists on a page served by PHP. Recent versions of OS X have it installed by default, too.
It's not frequently used for scripts that run for a long time — web pages need to be served quickly, after all. But you can run it from the command line just fine, if you'd like (our previous sysadmin had most of his maintenance scripts written in PHP). You may have to adjust its automatic timeout period upward if you use it this way, though (scripts that take too long to run are automatically terminated by default, since they usually represent a misbehaving web page that's a threat to system performance or stability).
PHP is widely available, fast, easy to read, uses a syntax that's a sort of mutt conglomeration of other languages (rather than an idiosyncratic dead-end), and has a ton of stuff built in — if you want to generate graphics or process PDFs, the functionality is likely already available rather than existing in an add-on you need to install.
PHP has a bad reputation because it's so easy to use — lots of lousy code has been written in it. It's also not object-oriented (although it pretends to be), which is important to professional programmers but mostly irrelevant to beginners. But there's tons of good documentation: nearly every page on <a class="reference external" href="http://www.php.net">PHP.net</a> contains dozens of comments from users offering helpful tips and sample code.
If you think your scripting efforts might primarily end up living on the web, PHP is probably the best choice for you. <a class="reference external" href="http://us2.php.net/tut.php">Here's a good starting point</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<p>That's it. At the very least you should poke through some starter documentation and get a sense of what's involved. You can get a lot done with a relatively small amount of programming knowledge. And of course if you've got a particular question you should feel free to leave a comment or send me an email. As you can probably tell, I'm anxious to share the scripting gospel.</p>

                    <p>Adrian Holovaty has just released a Python library called <a class="reference external" href="http://www.holovaty.com/blog/archive/2007/07/06/0128">templatemaker</a> that promises to make screen-scraping much easier.</p>
<p>Some explanation: if you're trying to do something automatically with a website, it's best if it has an API. This is a reliable, documented interface that your program can use to interact with the other site. Flickr has an API; Google has an API; del.icio.us has an API. Lots of sites have APIs.</p>
<p>But lots of sites don't. WMATA, for example, has none. In that situation you're stuck writing a program to parse the HTML of the site, which was designed to be viewed by humans, not robots. Here's a very simple made-up example. This table:</p>
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="54%" />
<col width="46%" />
</colgroup>
<thead valign="bottom">
<tr><th class="head">Time</th>
<th class="head">Line</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr><td>9:00 AM</td>
<td>Orange</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>1:00 PM</td>
<td>Blue</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Looks like so in HTML:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">&lt;table align=&quot;center&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; width=&quot;300&quot;&gt;</div>
<div class="line">&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Time&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Line&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;</div>
<div class="line">&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;9:00 AM&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Orange&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;</div>
<div class="line">&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;1:00 PM&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Blue&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;</div>
<div class="line">&lt;/table&gt;</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>And I can write some regular expression-laden Perl (or whatever) to extract info from it like so:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">while(my $l=&lt;&gt;)</div>

<p>This is a pain in the ass. Worse, if WMATA decides they want to make some minor cosmetic changes — altering the background color of each odd-numbered result row, or changing to 24-hour time notation, or even just adding some line breaks to make their HTML more readable — the regular expression will break and have to be meticulously redesigned. And this is just a simple example; in reality the initial regex will be much more unwieldy and the fixes much harder to identify and make.</p>
<p>Holovaty's templatemaker aims to automate this by matching similar stretches of text, allowing it to determine which portions of a set of documents vary and which remain constant, then plucking the variable data out on the basis of its analysis. Some of that will be junk — you probably aren't actually interested in the breadcrumbs or meta tags in a set of pages, although they're quite likely to vary across the set — but with an intelligent look at the results, this could greatly speed up the process of extracting data.</p>
<p>Check out the <a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/p/templatemaker/">sample usage</a> for a simple example of what I'm talking about. I'm not much of a Python-lover, but I'm looking forward to using this project.</p>

<li>The Unfoggedbot is doing pretty well, but just choked on the RSS feed again. I think that may have been because Becks was adding a feature I'd requested. Maybe not, though. I need to add some better error handling to that script, which is unexpectedly shaping up to be the weak spot in the system. I'll also need to schedule some downtime during which I add code to clear out the database every week or so — as things stand right now the comment DB will just keep growing and growing.</li>

                    <p>Tech project the second! I aspire to participate in the comment threads over at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.unfogged.com">Unfogged</a>. There's really no better place on the internet for listening to people with PhDs talk about such weighty topics as <a class="reference external" href="http://www.unfogged.com/archives/week_2007_07_08.html#007138">fat celebrity paramours</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.unfogged.com/archives/week_2007_07_08.html#007148">bizarre Japanese pornography</a>.</p>
<p>But it's tough. The comments come in quick bursts. The only real way to participate in a thread is to keep it open in a browser window, manually refreshing every few seconds. Unless I'm stuck on a bus, I get bored when a slow spell hits. I move to a different web page or task. I come back and thirty messages have gone by, and the conversation has moved past a point where I would've liked to participate. Crap. There's comment RSS, but the interval at which RSS readers update is much too slow for it to be very useful.</p>
<p>What I need is push technology — something that does the checking for me, only bothers me when there's new content, and does so <em>fast</em>. So hey, I built something. It's a pretty simple IM bot hooked up to a script that checks the comment RSS a few times a minute (hopefully this is okay by the Unfoggitburo — I figure one script that resyndicates content could ultimately serve to <em>reduce</em> load).</p>
<p>Based on my not-very-rigorous testing, it seems to work fairly well. If you're interested, give it a shot and let me know what you think, and any improvements that you'd like to see.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Add &quot;Unfogged&quot; to your AIM buddy list. Having the bot as a buddy loosens some of the rate limits that might otherwise prevent it from sending messages.</li>
<li>Send the bot a message containing the URL for a particular Unfogged thread. You can use either the entry's permalink or the comment thread's link. You should get back an IM saying you're subscribed to the thread.</li>
<li>From this point on you'll get an IM whenever someone posts to the thread. To toggle your subscription off, send the URL again. You should get another message confirming that you've been unsubscribed.</li>
</ol>
<p>Disclaimers! The script is pretty rough:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>it doesn't daemonize</li>
<li>the Net::OSCAR package apparently can't deal with rate limits, so if it hits one who knows what'll happen</li>
<li>if it crashes it won't relaunch, and it's running off a somewhat flaky server in my living room</li>
<li>it won't send IMs faster than once every three seconds in order to avoid rate limits, so it may get backed up during peak periods</li>
<li>and of course, it could always go crazy and start sending you floods of IMs (if that happens, I suggest just blocking the AIM user — send me an email or comment, while you're at it)</li>
</ul>
<p>But at the moment it seems okay! If folks find it useful I'll polish it up, post the code and find it a better home.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Already found a bug! If the RSS parser finds an empty feed (which can occur if it queries it at the same moment as the feed's being rebuilt by MT), it craps out. I think I fixed the script, but I could be wrong. I'll have to have a closer look in the morning. I can confidently say I restarted it, which should let it work for a while, at least.</p>

                    <p>I've pretty much completed my survey of phone options, and the news is not good. The <a class="reference external" href="http://www.helio.com/#devices_ocean">Ocean</a>'s keyboard isn't very good, its browser is hopelessly neutered and it crashed twice while I was using it. The <a class="reference external" href="http://t-mobile.com/shop/phones/Detail.aspx?device=acc8102d-4506-4eaa-bc2f-9c7b8ec1b1e0">Wing</a> is junky and also crashed while I was using it — Windows Mobile seems pretty awful. The <a class="reference external" href="http://t-mobile.com/shop/phones/Detail.aspx?device=f164419f-eee9-4cf6-a1bd-070dbe4b5023">Dash</a> has some style and an okay keyboard, but the store clerks were wary of it. And although it's clear that it's probably underpowered (despite its custom edition of Windows Mobile seeming pretty snappy), it's hard to say exactly how that limitation would manifest itself. &quot;Inconveniently&quot; is my guess.</p>
<p>Besides, I really don't want to be forced to commit to two more years on America's slowest data network. The iPhone's beautiful, but if I were to spend that much money I'd want a less flaky keyboard, an SSH client and the ability to tether my laptop to it. I'm confident that software revisions (and perhaps an SDK) will make the device unassailably awesome, but for now I'm content to wait.</p>
<p>So yes, I'm a broken man — despite yesterday morning's wide-eyed telephonic optimism, I'm now trolling Craigslist and Ebay for used Sidekick 3s. The handset is a disappointment, to be sure: no maps, no video, no tethering, and Danger inexplicably makes their keyboards worse with every device revision. But it still offers the best keyboard out there, a fairly responsive and nearly-uncrashable operating system, and the promise of resuming normal Tom-phone activities until the iPhone pressures the market into making better devices. Here's to maintaining the status quo.</p>

The screen had been misbehaving for a while, occasionally displaying useless garbage instead of meaningful content like Twitter messages about what people in California had for dinner. Flipping the screen up and down usually solved the problem, but not anymore. First it was stuck as gibberish; now it just doesn't show anything. I'm stuck with the aged t39m (monochrome!) pictured on the right.</p>
<p>So I guess I'd better get a new phone, huh? The iPhone's appearance is a little too recent, and my need to pay $200 to cancel a contract (I have two T-Mobile accounts thanks to LastCall) means that it's out of my price range. Besides, I don't want to have to compete with Yglesias in the making-hilarious-observations-about-iPhone-quirks game.</p>
<p>Right now I think I'll follow through on my threats to get an Ocean, even though <a class="reference external" href="http://mstem.wordpress.com/">Matt's</a> review has been lukewarm. The platform's locked down in the same way as the Sidekick, and it's clear there are some problems that future firmware upgrades will have to be used to work out. But mostly it looks like what the Sidekick 3 should have been, except with a lousier keyboard. The lack of an SSH client gives me pause — it's pretty awesome to fix a website from your phone — but I imagine I can work out some horribly-insecure alternative with an IM interface or a Java applet. I plan commandeer my officemates' phones tomorrow — as a web developer I'm officially sanctioned with that power, and both the iPhone and Ocean are represented — then I guess I'll take the plunge.</p>
<p>Unless someone tells me that's a horrible idea, of course. Anybody?</p>
<p><strong>OH YEAH:</strong> I should point out that although my venerable t39m is an excellent phone, it's a terrible everything else. So don't send me text messages until I get this worked out, if you don't mind — there's pretty much no chance I'll retrieve them on this thing.</p>

However it's already sprung up under a new name — MP3Sparks — and brought over customers' accounts and balances. I've successfully used AllOfMP3 in the past and been pleased with the experience. Better still, I haven't been murdered or sold into slavery by the Russian mafia. All in all, a better experience than anticipated.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://apple.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/07/02/1642242&amp;from=rss">Universal is pulling their music off of iTunes</a>, or at least threatening to.

                    <p>Check out the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/06/27/kevin-roses-new-startup-pownce/">TechCrunch writeup</a> of Kevin Rose's new venture, Pownce. I am, of course, insanely jealous of Kevin for his wild success with thebroken, AOTS and Digg. But despite my petty predisposition, this looks like a winner to me. Here's the comment I left at TechCrunch:</p>
<blockquote>
This is Twitter, plus Dave Winerâ€™s currently-gestating <a class="reference external" href="http://www.twittergram.com/">TwitterGram</a> concept. I wonder how useful segmenting out events and links will be, though, versus just using general text tweeting for it. If thereâ€™s calendar software integration or an RSVPing mechanism, I could see it being very useful. For links maybe not as much, but Iâ€™m sure some social bookmark tie-ins would make it at least interesting (and Iâ€™m sure thereâ€™ll be Digg integration).</blockquote>
<p>The interface looks a <em>lot</em> like <a class="reference external" href="http://iconfactory.com/software/twitterrific">Twitterific</a> to me, and I think it could be extremely appealing to people who are addicted to Facebook feeds (i.e. everyone I know).</p>
<p>It doesn't seem like anything particularly ground-breaking, but the more I think about it the more exciting it seems. If asking people to a spur-of-the-moment happy hour (and getting a headcount for it) is as simple as using Twitterific — that is, you hit a hotkey, type in a message and hit send — it could be genuinely useful. It's much too early to say for sure, of course, but it all strikes me as being very promising.</p>
<p>One criticism, though: he should've named it pwnce.</p>
<p><strong>FOR THE GEEKS:</strong> This could also make for an even better bareknuckle cage match with Twitter than I first thought: they're running their website on Django, a Python framework created by Adrian Holovaty. Twitter's website, on the other hand, is the web's biggest Ruby On Rails application, and has become well-known for being at the forefront of figuring out how to make RoR scale — this is the sort of stuff <a class="reference external" href="http://www.al3x.net">Al3x</a> works on (and gets interviewed about) on a day to day basis. RoR-haters frequently point to Django as a comparable framework that doesn't have Rails' efficiency problems. So! This will be a nice head-to-head matchup of competing technologies.</p>
<p>Of course, there's no clear indication that Pownce's messaging engine is also written in Python (Twitter's is written in Ruby). And there's also no real proof that they'll be a direct competitor to Twitter, in that we don't know whether Pownce will integrate with IM, SMS and other interfaces the way Twitter does (that could ultimately be a boon to them, though, since they won't have to burn through capital buying everyone free SMSes).</p>

Carr says the OSS isn't very good at innovating. Tim disagrees:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">There are lots of examples of ground-breaking free software. Apache wasnâ€™t the first web server, but it preceded most of the proprietary servers now on the market, and itâ€™s been the market leader almost from its introduction. Perl, Python, PHP, BitTorrent, and SendMail are a few examples off the top of my head of free software programs that arenâ€™t clones of proprietary protocols. And on the flip side, a lot of Microsoft software is derivative. For example, Excel, Word, Windows, IIS, and SQL Server were all late-comers to markets that had been pioneered by other companies.</div>
<div class="line">The reality is that really groundbreaking software ideas — word processors, spreadsheets, the web — are extremely rare, and theyâ€™re usually the work of a single smart individual. Whether that individual chooses to commercialize his idea or license it as free software is up to the whim of that individual. The vast majority of software development, on the other hand, involves making incremental improvements to existing software products and concepts. As far as I can see, thatâ€™s equally true whether youâ€™re talking about free software or proprietary software.</div>

</blockquote>
<p>I think Tim's right: it's silly to complain about the lack of paradigm-shifting projects on <a class="reference external" href="http://www.sourceforge.net">SourceForge</a>. Ideas like the nonlinear video editor, the word processor or the spreadsheet simply don't come along all that often, and many of them originated before the internet had made open source software possible and widely-known. And, in fact, I think you'd be surprised how many <a class="reference external" href="http://www.dontclick.it">experimental interfaces</a> you could find in the open source world if you cared to look. It's just that most of them are pretty lousy. Boring as it may be, I believe that there is a relatively narrow range of visual metaphors that are appropriate for manipulating data on a 2D display with a pointing device and a bunch of buttons.</p>
<p>With that said, I do think Tim's overstating his case just a bit. There aren't enough originality-related datapoints within the world of classical applications — instead, let's look at games. The evidence here is less than encouraging. There are plenty of open-source games, but few have gained traction in a serious way. And they're frequently derivative: the most successful open-source games tend to be clones of existing commercial games like <a class="reference external" href="http://osswin.sourceforge.net/games.html#tetris_clones">Tetris</a> or <a class="reference external" href="http://freeciv.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page">Civilization</a>, or applications that <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-Strike">build on</a> or <a class="reference external" href="http://www.mame.net/">otherwise</a> <a class="reference external" href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~owend/free/bnetd.html">support</a> playing commercial games more cheaply or easily.</p>
<p>But I don't think this lack of originality is due to any inherent flaw in open-source contributors or the organizational model they employ. I think it's simply a question of capital — open source projects typically haven't got any. The vast majority of applications benefit from network effects that arise when their userbase becomes large enough: suddenly it's easier to find someone to play against online, or the documentation is better, or you can exchange files in the same format that your friend uses. It's relatively easy for open-source projects to achieve the necessary level of market interest when dealing with highly technical users and applications, as Tim's examples demonstrate — there are accepted techniques (e.g. the RFC process, making frequent commits to the project) and media outlets (e.g. listservs, usenet) that can confer legitimacy and generate interest without an investment.</p>
<p>That isn't true for products aimed at consumers, however — these frequently require investment in concerted promotion efforts in order to reach the network tipping point (or else must meet an unfulfilled need in a way that generates earned media like Wikipedia has). Witness the Ogg Vorbis audio format, which is widely agreed to be technically superior to MP3, offers advantages that are applicable to the average consumer, and has been <a class="reference external" href="http://www.neurosaudio.com/">almost</a> completely ignored.</p>
<p>This brings up another issue: collaboration with the private sector is often much more difficult for open source projects. If Ogg had been able to attract support among portable audio player manufacturers its history might be very different. Similarly, it's easy to imagine that if the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.blender.org/">Blender</a> project could talk to Nvidia about what advances their next generation graphics cards will offer, it might be able to better-compete with professional products like Maya and 3DS Max (I should note that I'm not particularly familiar with 3D modeling software, so perhaps I'm wrong about this).</p>
<p>But that's frequently not possible, and consequently the open-source projects that succeed are the ones that can form a symbiotic or parasitic relationship with products that have institutional backing. It's a lot easier to get folks to use your word processor if it can speak to Microsoft Word; it's a lot easier to get people to play your FPS if it's an add-on to a game that already has a large installed base; it's a lot easier to launch an IM client if it talks to an existing network.</p>
<p>That's the issue, I think. Carr makes out open source software's derivative nature to be a question of organization, but that's flatly wrong. The conventions may be different, but many projects have well-developed protocols surrounding the use of development IRC channels or mailing lists. Anyone who thinks the Mozilla or Apache (or Drupal!) projects could have achieved what they have without a high degree of coordination among volunteers is crazy. These organizations have roadmaps, design documents and established internal policies. It's just PR money and private-sector legitimacy that they lack. Fortunately the public's increasing technical literacy means that the need for the former is declining; the undeniable commercial relevance of open source means that projects are increasingly being accorded the latter.</p>

                    <p><img alt="a 555 timer chip" class="right" src="/static/2007/06/15/20070615_555.jpg" style="width: 250px; height: 250px;" />Ever since <a class="reference external" href="http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,71087-0.html?tw=rss.index">reading</a> about the body-modification folks who've implanted magnets in their fingers I've been <a class="reference external" href="http://www.zunta.org/blog/archives/2006/06/07/oh_dear/">kind of fixated</a> on the idea. Being able to sense magnetic fields seems like it'd be awfully cool. But even if the unavailability of anesthesia for the operation wasn't enough to scare me off, the apparently-guaranteed infection that follows would be.</p>
<p>As my meager knowledge of electronics has grown, the idea of building a tool has begun to seem more feasible, and promises to merely result in finger burns instead of outright amputations. I've been screwing around with a 555 timer and pricing Hall Effect sensors in preparation for building a gadget that'll whistle to me when it feels a field.</p>
<p>But <a class="reference external" href="http://www.instructables.com/id/EXPHY2GW12ERXTRZAS/?ALLSTEPS">look</a>! Someone already built <em>the exact same thing</em> and put it on Instructables. It's a good thing, too, since I a) didn't realize that Hall sensors put out varying voltage instead of resistance and b) wouldn't know how to change a 555's timing on that basis. In fact, due to my unwillingness to untangle resistors and figure out their <a class="reference external" href="http://www.zambetti.com/projects/resistulator/">color codes</a>, my 555 circuit keeps threatening to melt down. I'd still like to put this together, but I may substitute a vibrating motor that I scrounged from a walkie-talkie instead of making it sound-based — turning it into a tactile feedback mechanism seems like it'd do more to satisfy my fingermagnet lust.</p>
<p>At any rate, it's cool to see that the idea's workable, even if it's slightly disappointing to be beaten to the internet writeup of what I thought was an original(ish) idea.</p>
<p>The curious can find a little pedantry from a decidedly underqualified electronics expert after the jump.</p>
<p>The gadget works thanks to three components. First, there's a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.google.com/custom?domains=makezine.com&amp;sitesearch=makezine.com&amp;q=555&amp;sa.x=0&amp;sa.y=0&amp;cof=GALT%3A%23008000%3BGL%3A1%3BDIV%3A%23336699%3BVLC%3A663399%3BAH%3Acenter%3BBGC%3AFFFFFF%3BLBGC%3A336699%3BALC%3A0000FF%3BLC%3A0000FF%3BT%3A000000%3BGFNT%3A0000FF%3BGIMP%3A0000FF%3BFORID%3A1%3B&amp;client=pub-1711976718738240&amp;forid=1&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;oe=ISO-8859-1&amp;hl=en">555 timer</a>, a venerable chip that can be bought at Radioshack for about fifty cents. This ingenious little device can be wired up to do two things: it can either act as a one shot timer, turning on an output for a configurable amount of time and then switching off; or it can act as an oscillator, switching an output on and off continuously at a configurable rate. The first mode of operation is called monostable mode; the second is called astable mode. You generally configure the delay by swapping different-sized resistors and capacitors into a very <a class="reference external" href="http://home.cogeco.ca/~rpaisley4/LM555Monostable.GIF">simple</a> <a class="reference external" href="http://home.cogeco.ca/~rpaisley4/LM555Astable.GIF">circuit</a> that contains the 555. It's great for projects that flash lights or need to trigger action after a set delay, and it makes for a good Baby's First Integrated Circuit. That's certainly why I'm using it.</p>
<p>In this case the 555 is set up to work in astable mode, switching its output on and off very quickly. Its output is connected to the second major component, a piezoelectric element. This is a little ceramic disc that expands and contracts ever so slightly when voltage is applied to it. You may have run into piezoelectrics in advertisements for fancy pseudoscientific skis, or you may have heard about how quartz crystals work to keep time. It's pretty much the same deal. You can buy one at Radioshack for a couple of bucks. In this case the expansion and contraction is occurring so quickly — thanks to the 555 timer — that it actually generates sound waves. I'm not sure what the 555's nominal oscillation range is, but it's not hard to get it to fall within the ~20-20000 hertz range of the human ear.</p>
<p>The final bit is the sensor, which works thanks to something called the Hall Effect. In the absence of a good explanation, I'll simply state that it's magic. The spell amounts to this: stick it in a magnetic field and the voltage of a current run through the sensor will vary based upon the magnetic field's strength. Radioshack doesn't stock these guys, but they can be acquired from Digikey for a few dollars. You also might be able to scrounge one out of those ridiculous battery-powered home security alarms that you stick on windows — you know, the ones that come in blister-packs for $20 or so. That's how the window alarms operate: one side has a permanent magnet in it and the other has a Hall sensor. If the window is opened the magnetic field goes away, the sensor detects the change and an alarm is triggered. Hall sensors are used in all kinds of mechanical systems that need to detect the position of something without actually coming into physical contact with it. <a class="reference external" href="http://www.instructables.com/id/EEVRBRUWWIES9J6KPG/">Here's</a> an instructable where a Hall sensor is used to count how many times a drill head has rotated.</p>
<p>The basic idea here is that the Hall sensor's output changes the characteristics of the circuit that govern the 555's oscillation rate. When that rate changes, the pitch of the sound generated by the piezoelectric element is altered. For a lot of sensors, the internal resistance changes in relation to whatever's being sensed. You incorporate the sensor into the portion of the 555 circuit that determines its timing based on resistance, et voila. But in this case the sensor changes its output voltage, which the instructable author deals with by feeding it into the 555 in a way that is probably pretty simple, but never would've occurred to me.</p>
<p>The rest of the circuit is just stuff to regulate the power supply. It's a pretty simple doohickey, but I still think it'd be fun to build.</p>

<p><a class="reference external" href="http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=238001&amp;cid=19457205">This comment</a> is particularly good. The author's right: traffic shaping is going to be necessary for consumer ISPs. At the same time, innovation will be best served if consumers have the option of unfettered access. There generally aren't enough competitors in the consumer arena in a given market to ensure that customers flitting between ISPs will whittle the field down to the optimal offering. And the jump from consumer-priced access to business-priced access isn't feasible — business service is just too expensive, for a variety of reasons. It's a market failure, in other words.</p>
<p>The slashdot nerds favor the same solution I do: metered data transfers. The common response to this is that customers hate metered access. I still don't buy that — millions of people do just fine with metered cell phone access. Pay for a monthly cushion of access, then pay a metered rate for overages. It's simple! And, I think, inevitable.</p>
<p>Sadly, I suspect that this will probably mostly serve as a way for ISPs to gouge geeks with new fees, rather than a revenue-neutral way for them to adopt restructured, more efficient billing practices. Oh well. It's still preferable to having my Bittorrent and encrypted traffic slow to a crawl and not be able to do anything about it.</p>

                    <p>My software output has dropped off over the last few months. There are a couple of reasons for that: I've had a few private projects to work on for friends, I've been traveling a lot, the winter blues hit me — all kinds of minor things. But a bigger factor is that I've been a little bored with it. The technologies I use most are losing their sheen: PHP isn't glamorous; neither is Perl. I've made some half-hearted stabs at learning Ruby, but I'm a pretty application-oriented guy when it comes to technology (believe it or not) — if a technology doesn't let me do something new and cool, I'm not incredibly interested. Ruby's beautiful, but I'm not ready to spend time on Rails. And as a standalone scripting language, its packages are inferior to Perl. You can do less cool stuff with it (although when you do something you tend to do it in a satisfyingly elegant manner).</p>
<p>The buzzed-about technology platforms have been uninspiring, too. Second Life's brief luster has faded — it looks and performs like crap, there's nothing to do in it but make trouble, and development has to occur in-world, which is frustrating. Twitter's fun and refreshingly simple, but I think other devs have squeezed just about everything out of it that there is to be squozen. I find Facebook to be kind of dumb, and developing for it sounds like no fun at all — a crippled subset of PHP? No thanks.</p>
<p>So I'm stuck waiting for the next big, fun software platform. In the meantime, I've been trying to teach myself about microcontrollers. There's a lot to learn, and it's a bit of a pain in the ass — screwing around with software generally only requires downloading a tarball and firing up a text editor. Working with electronics is harder: debugging is tedious and difficult, and soldering irons take a while to warm up. And although it's a pretty cheap hobby, it's still more expensive than software. I've been doing a lot more reading than wiring.</p>
<p>Still, the potential for making technology interact with the physical world is irresistible, and I've gradually been piecing together the necessary knowledge from the inscrutable materials scattered across the web.</p>
<p>All of which is my way of introducing <a class="reference external" href="http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/present.php?p=BEE-1-PowerSupply">Spark Fun's tutorials on the subject</a>, which breezily cover the vast majority of things I've taught myself about uCs over the last few months. It sure would've been nice to have this a few months back. If you're interested in the subject, or even just curious what uCs are and can do, give it a read.</p>

As it happens, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.zunta.org/blog/archives/2006/01/05/usc_thoroughly/">I have some experience in this area</a>. It's pretty simple to do, but it still seems worthwhile to write it up in order to better preserve future generations' novel and/or hilarious voicemails.</p>
<p>So:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">Download <a class="reference external" href="http://www.skype.com">Skype</a> and buy some SkypeOut credit so that you can make calls to non-Skype phone numbers — in this case, your voicemail system.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Use some software to record Skype's output. On the PC, <a class="reference external" href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/">Audacity</a> should work, although you may need to fiddle with your Windows sound settings to make sure it's recording from the right sound source. On the Mac you'll want to use <a class="reference external" href="http://www.rogueamoeba.com/audiohijack/">Audio Hijack</a>, the free trial of which should work great for this purpose (provided that your VM is less than ten minutes long).
Audio Hijack is pretty simple to use: first, make sure Skype is closed. Then launch AH. Click the new button, name the entry &quot;Skype&quot; (or whatever else you'd like to call it) and point it toward the copy of Skype in your Applications folder. Close the dialog, highlight the new &quot;Skype&quot; entry, click Hijack. A copy of Skype will launch — but this version will pipe all of its sound through Audio Hijack. You can start and stop recording of this sound with the &quot;Record&quot; button that sits to the right of the &quot;Hijack&quot; button.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Dial your own phone number and let it go to voicemail. While your voicemail greeting plays, hit the star button on Skype's virtual keypad (this is how it works for T-Mobile — if your carrier's voicemail system works differently, get in touch with them to see how to check messages from phones other than your mobile). Then enter your PIN. You should now be in your voicemail menu, able to navigate using Skype's virtual keypad. Start recording in Audio Hijack or Audacity (don't do it while you're still entering touchtone commands, lest some weirdo steal your voicemail info). Get the voicemail to play and end the call. Stop recording in Audacity or Audio Hijack.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Edit the file that was just recorded (Audacity is a good choice for this on the Mac, too — whether you're on Mac or PC, make sure to install <a class="reference external" href="http://spaghetticode.org/lame/">this software</a> so you can save from Audacity to MP3 format). If you're using Audacity, the audio will already be in the editor, ready for pruning and saving. Audio Hijack places its recordings in a subdirectory of your Music folder by default. Once you've got the file properly edited, save to MP3, post to the internet and revel in its awesomeness.</p>
</li>
<li><div class="first line-block">
<div class="line">Oh, and to make it really easy for people to listen to this or any other MP3 on your website, create a hyperlink to the MP3, then include this line of code somewhere in the entry (or in your page's template):</div>
</div>
<blockquote>
<pre class="literal-block">
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;http://del.icio.us/js/playtagger&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
<p>That's it! I may have failed at making it sound easy, but trust me: once you figure it out the first time, it's all pretty intuitive.</p>

<p>Previously the only place I knew for acquiring Arduinos was <a class="reference external" href="http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/advanced_search_result.php?keywords=arduino&amp;x=0&amp;y=0">Spark Fun</a>. And although I like Spark Fun a lot, the $40ish price tag for an Arduino had me eying the possibility of learning how to directly program and use the AVR microcontrollers that make up the Arduino's heart, without using the other features that the Arduino platform makes available. $40 is a considerably bigger outlay for a pointless home automation project than an AVR (which only costs a few dollars) and some components I already have lying around.</p>
<p>But Modern Device seems to have realized some savings by pulling the USB-to-serial chip off the Arduino board and counting on it being in the programming cable. There's something to be said for having it on-board the chip — if you want your Arduino project to talk to a PC, you'll want the USB-to-serial interface to always be present. But if you're building an embedded device that stands on its own, there's no need for that functionality except when you're loading your program.</p>
<p>Of course, all of this is possible because the Arduino is an <a class="reference external" href="http://www.arduino.cc">open source platform</a>. Here's hoping they keep gaining marketshare and driving down prices. Competitors like Parallax may offer chips with more capabilities, but they're proprietary and more expensive. And given the low cost of full-blown PCs these days, the returns on adding functionality to a general-purpose hobbyist microcontroller begin to diminish <em>very</em> rapidly. There's just not much point in <a class="reference external" href="http://makezine.com/10/propeller/">building speech synthesis</a> into a relatively hard-to-use uC when a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.acrosser.com/Product/Embedded%20PC/3.5%20Biscuit%20SBC/sbc_eden_b1651.html">complete</a>, tiny <a class="reference external" href="http://gumstix.org/">embedded PC</a> can be had for a little over $100.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>Last week I used Viktor Mayer-SchÃ¶nberger's <a class="reference external" href="http://www.vmsweb.net/attachments/pdf/Useful_Void.pdf">&quot;Useful Void&quot; proposal</a> (PDF) as a jumping-off point to ruminate about Facebook, the work/personal divide and darknets over <a class="reference external" href="http://www.manifestdensity.net/2007/05/10/the_internet_is_like_an_electr/">here</a>. Along the way I casually dismissed Mayer-SchÃ¶nberger's proposal:</p>
<blockquote>
I'm sure his heart is in the right place, but this is dumb for all the same reasons that DRM is dumb. You really, really can't control the spread or persistence of publicly available digital information. Efforts to do so are a waste of everyone's time.</blockquote>
<p>But then, much to my surprise, the man himself popped up in comments, leaving this polite note:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">You seem to suggest that my proposal is similar to IP secured by DRM. It seems that you haven't actually looked at my paper. In the paper I suggest that a DRM-like approach (as Lessig has made in Code 2.0) would be overkill. What I desire is not perfect solution, just a shift in defaults that makes users think again about the choice of forgetting.</div>
<div class="line">I encourage you to read the paper - it's a free download, including from my <a class="reference external" href="http://www.vmsweb.net/">website</a>, and I think addresses some of the concerns you seem to have.</div>
<div class="line">In contrast your solution (cognitively accepting the fact that we are transparent and thus weigh things differently) depends on our brains ability to adapt - not something that cognitive scientists have much hope in I am afraid, espcially since biologically we are wired to forget.</div>
<div class="line">Kind regards,</div>
<div class="line">VMS</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, guilty as charged — I hadn't read his proposal. But now I have, and I'm afraid that I still arrive at much the same conclusion: I think that it probably isn't workable, and it definitely wouldn't be wise.</p>
<p>His proposal specifically involves the legislative mandating of a system of expiration metadata that would be built into software. It could be easily overridden by data creators when necessary — your Word documents won't start disappearing — but by default data would be &quot;forgotten&quot; after a set period of time.</p>
<p>But how did we get into the situation we're currently in, with huge amounts of data being acquired? As Mayer-SchÃ¶nberger points out, storage is very cheap. But it's not free — data is still retained for one of two reasons: either people assign <em>value</em> to the data, or the costs associated with throwing it away (and sifting out what shouldn't be thrown away) exceed the cost of storing it.</p>
<p>The proposal may help with the second situation. Introducing statutory penalties raises the cost of retaining data, which may spur organizations to throw it away. Of course, the cost of throwing away data isn't made any cheaper by the system, but presumably Mayer-SchÃ¶nberger thinks it's worthwhile to introduce that inefficiency.</p>
<p>The first situation is unlikely to be helped, however. If a user assigns value to a piece of data — i.e. they think it's useful or may become useful in the future — there's very little that one can do to stop them from retaining it indefinitely. Data doesn't just delete itself, after all. To make sure it disappears at a set time you can do one of two things: either design a system that simply refuses to read a piece of data after the expiration date, or one that actively collects and deletes content on or near the expiration date. The first option involves per-use permissioning — simply put, it's DRM, and just as difficult to implement effectively. The second system relies on the creation and maintenance by the user of systems designed to destroy data they want to keep. Unless Trusted Computing becomes a reality, that's not likely to happen — and even then, what could you do about physical media like DVDs?</p>
<p>Besides, there's a downside to this proposal: driving data archiving underground (so to speak) would lead to great losses in utility. Suppose that a message board's content is set to auto-expire after a few years in order to protect its participants from getting into trouble over their semi-private conversations. Google and other prominent digital archivists would no doubt comply with the regulation, depriving users of whatever legitimate benefit could be had from searching its content. But there's simply no way to stop, say, a group administrator from burning the archives to disc and then releasing embarrassing posts when another forum denizen runs for office. If data is valued, it will be retained.</p>
<p>I think the proposed system would work decently for preventing employers from going through photos of employees' drunken college exploits, or stopping health insurers from checking clients' web output for hints of preexisting conditions. But it would do very little to affect data retention by individuals — technologically-enforced auto-deletion won't work and encryption makes enforcement nearly impossible. And it's difficult to imagine how a universal technological solution would be any more effective at constraining data retention than simple legislation targeting specific industries that says, &quot;Hey! Throw that data away after X months!&quot;</p>
<p>As a technologist I'm extremely familiar with the temptation to accomplish everything with a well-designed system. But it's very difficult to constrain digital actions with digital technology. Fear of punishment is the only real way to change this behavior — and that can be instilled without rewriting every piece of software in existence.</p>

                    <p>Ed Felten has <a class="reference external" href="http://www.freedom-to-tinker.com/?p=1154">an interesting post</a> up this morning discussing the 09-f9 HD-DVD key and why the net has been replicating it so enthusiastically. He has a number of explanations for why people are showing such antipathy toward the AACS LA's efforts to suppress the key. I'm most interested in the second one, because it's pretty widespread and very, very silly:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">...the content in question is an integer — an ordinary number, in other words. The number is often written in geeky alphanumeric format, but it can be written equivalently in a more user-friendly form like 790,815,794,162,126,871,771,506,399,625. Giving a private party ownership of a number seems deeply wrong to people versed in mathematics and computer science. Letting a private group pick out many millions of numbers (like the AACS secret keys), and then simply declare ownership of them, seems even worse</div>
<div class="line">While itâ€™s obvious why the creator of a movie or a song might deserve some special claim over the use of their creation, itâ€™s hard to see why anyone should be able to pick a number at random and unilaterally declare ownership of it. There is nothing creative about this number — indeed, it was chosen by a method designed to ensure that the resulting number was in no way special. Itâ€™s just a number they picked out of a hat. And now they own it?</div>
<div class="line">As if thatâ€™s not weird enough, there are actually millions of other numbers (other keys used in AACS) that AACS LA claims to own, and we donâ€™t know what they are. When I wrote the thirty-digit number that appears above, I carefully avoided writing the real 09F9 number, so as to avoid the possibility of mind-bending lawsuits over integer ownership. But there is still a nonzero probability that AACS LA thinks it owns the number I wrote.</div>
<div class="line">When the great mathematician Leopold Kronecker wrote his famous dictum, â€œGod created the integers; all else is the work of manâ€?, he meant that the basic structure of mathematics is part of the design of the universe. What God created, AACS LA now wants to take away.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Okay, so it's a little melodramatic. But you can see his point. He's not alone in this, either: BoingBoing has been <a class="reference external" href="http://www.boingboing.net/2007/05/02/oh_how_i_love_the_ge.html">petulantly</a> <a class="reference external" href="http://www.boingboing.net/2007/05/02/are_these_colors_ill.html">maintaining</a> that if we all just pretend the number is being used for other purposes, it'll be just dandy to redistribute it.</p>
<p>I'm no fan of DRM, and I think the AACS LA's actions are pointless and stupid. But Doctorow and Felten are being disingenuous — they're simply too smart not to see the problem with this argument. Namely, that <em>any</em> type of data, sampled at a chosen level of precision, can be represented as a number. Consequently, if you believe that one or more types of information deserve legal protection — as Felten seems to, when he refers to songs &amp; movies — then the argument that &quot;it's just a number!&quot; becomes ridiculous.</p>
<p>Sixteen bytes is probably too short to merit a copyright. But that's not the right that the AACS LA is asserting: they're calling the code a &quot;circumvention device&quot; under the DMCA. And even if you don't recognize the DMCA's validity, there are other forms of intellectual property protection that may apply — there are laws related to trade secrets, for example. If you just think about it a little, it should be obvious that even a very short piece of data can enjoy some kinds of legal protection. Sixteen bytes is more that enough room to encode the words &quot;Coca-Cola&quot;, after all.</p>
<p>The thing is, geeks like to pretend that the legal system is some sort of Rube Goldberg contraption, easily foiled by their unparalleled cleverness. Sadly, this isn't the case. All the IANAL-prefixed prattling on Slashdot about quick &amp; easy ways to make yourself legally bulletproof when the cops/MPAA/interpol come knocking are little more than wishful thinking. It's like holding your finger an inch from your sibling's face and yelling, &quot;I'm not touching you!&quot; over and over. Your parents weren't dumb enough to fall for that, and neither is the legal system.</p>
<p>So yes, if you accidentally used <a class="reference external" href="http://t3knomanser.livejournal.com/906184.html">these colors</a> in a design, I doubt you'd be breaking the law. If you wrote this <a class="reference external" href="http://scriptorium.monastic.org/">terrible poem</a> by chance, you'd be fine. But if you provided either intentionally, as a way of transmitting a &quot;circumvention device&quot;, then you broke the law. It's entirely possible for a judge to make reasonable inferences about what you probably intended to do. I don't know where people got the idea that courtrooms are run by robots that'll start spewing sparks &amp; smoke if you feed them a logical paradox. It just ain't so.</p>
<p>Most of all, I'm surprised by Felten saying that making a number protected will irk &quot;people versed in mathematics and computer science&quot; most of all. In fact, the people who don't understand why a number could deserve protection are the ones who sat through their CS and information theory classes but emerged without actually understanding the point of it all. Information is information. The fact that it can be encoded in many different ways is neat — it's nearly magical, in fact, and the very essence of why digital technology is so amazingly powerful — but doesn't change its essential nature. Refusing to admit that numbers are only protected <em>in context</em> reveals either ignorance of these ideas or simple denial of them.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>I've taken another crack at my full-text RSS script, polishing it up for a release over at <a class="reference external" href="http://labs.echoditto.com">EchoDitto Labs</a>, and in the process I finally got around to adding a much-needed feature: letting users kill excess HTML with regular expressions. This isn't a feature for the non-geeky, but it only takes a single nerd a few minutes to work out the necessary expressions and share them with the class. The result is cleaner functionality: the algorithm used to leave some feeds with duplicate titles, comments, or other cruft. This allows you to strip them out automatically. As a side effect, your RSS reader stop thinking that old posts are new just because another dope added a comment calling for impeachment hearings.</p>
<p>My intention is for this project to be somewhat disruptive, forcing publishers and advertisers to realize that RSS is a legitimate way for people to read a site and not just a syndicated form of advertising. And the sooner everyone gets this through their head the better: if you publish free content on the internet, you will not be able to control how people will consume it.</p>
<p>But I do recognize that in the short term it's likely to be a pain in the ass for the bloggers I like and whose bosses don't understand how to count or sell RSS impressions. So let's start off by picking on someone who deserves the headache: <a class="reference external" href="http://www.metamonkey.net/fulltextrss2/?url=http://michellemalkin.com/index.xml&amp;regex=%2F%3C%21%5C-%5C-%5Cs%2A%3D%7B5%2C%7D.%2A%24%2Fsmi">here's a full text feed for Michelle Malkin</a>. It uses the new regex functionality to chop off the &quot;digg this post&quot; junk that would otherwise be at the bottom of every entry.</p>
<p>The way to use this new feature is pretty simple: pass URL-encoded regexes as GET parameters named &quot;/regex\d*/i&quot; (if you're going to use this, that made sense to you). Have at it, fellow geeks. I'll get things rolling and suggest the del.icio.us tag &quot;<a class="reference external" href="http://del.icio.us/search/?fr=del_icio_us&amp;p=fulltextrss&amp;type=all">fulltextrss</a>&quot; for the fruits of your labors.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE FOR REGEX AUTHORS:</strong> Looks like PHP's magic quotes and/or URL encoding are screwing up the use of the + character in regexes. D'oh. I'll have to see what I can do to fix that. In the meantime, both * and {} seem to work. For now just use {1,} as a substitute and you should be okay.</p>

<p>This is the second goddamn time, earning it the coveted title of the worst PHP software I've encountered that isn't also a Wordpress plugin. Enough already; it's gone. JP recently pointed me toward the decidedly more reputable-seeming <a class="reference external" href="http://www.phpsurveyor.org/">PHPSurveyor</a> this week, so I guess I'll be working on a DCist template for that.</p>
<p>Fortunately the jerk in question didn't do a very thorough job of trashing my site: he just killed the files in directories off the top level (sparing my blog, inexplicably) and put up some triumphal pages expressing his disapproval of US/Israeli foreign policy. Even more fortunately, my host has a backup from the 15th that they're pulling for me for $15. For those of you using the full text RSS script, sorry — it was one of the victims. A new &amp; improved version will be available soon at a different location anyway, though, so just sit tight for now.</p>
<p>And hey, you know the saying: God doesn't close a metasploit session without opening an interesting LUG thread. So I've got big things planned: a nightly backup to my own RAIDed SVN repository that in turn backs itself up to Amazon S3. It'll be great.</p>

But there may also be other giant robots of differing ideologies in this movie. I don't want to tip my hand.</p>
<p>Found via <a class="reference external" href="http://dansdata.blogsome.com/2007/04/19/if-you-download-only-one-157mb-avi-file-today/">Dan's Data</a> — he's got links to the original, full-resolution version. It's an amateur effort put together by a group of Italian CG artists (hence the occasionally laughable voice-acting).</p>
<p>Mostly this is just awesome. But I can't resist the opportunity to use a giant Nazi robot as a pretense for pontification — namely, about the capacity for entertainment produced by hobbyists to compete directly with the stuff made by professionals. I've argued <a class="reference external" href="/2007/01/31/its-all-just-bits/">this point</a> in the past, but have generally met with some skepticism about its capacity to apply to movies. I like to cite the fan-produced movie <a class="reference external" href="http://www.panicstruckpro.com/revelations/">Star Wars: Revelations</a> when I make this case. It's undeniably impressive from a technical perspective, but its lousy acting is an admitted sticking point for my larger argument.</p>
<p>This clip (&quot;Code Guardian&quot;) suffers from the same problems as SW:R — it looks pretty good, but the voice acting is lousy and the script, to the extent that there is one, couldn't be called remarkable. Still, I think this is a temporary problem. Perhaps it's my own prejudices showing, but I think there's a higher barrier to producing passable CG work than there is to producing a passable action/adventure screenplay or voiceover. Becoming adept at any of these tasks requires a lot of practice and/or talent, but only one discipline requires specialized tools and training. So in a way it's surprising to see the more technical disciplines become the first to succeed at producing high-quality hobbyist entertainment. But in another way it isn't surprising at all.</p>
<p>People participate in free software endeavors for a lot of reasons, but prestige and social interaction surely rank high on the list. The nature of the internet facilitates the free exchange of information, and the nature of technical disciplines results in heavy internet use by those who practice them. That makes the net a good place to for CG artists to compete for prestige and participate in communities like <a class="reference external" href="http://www.worth1000.com/">Worth1000</a>. Other, less wired professions — like, say, voiceover actors — haven't started generating and giving away online content in the same way.</p>
<p>But I think that's just a temporary problem — nerdiness is not a prerequisite for participation in these communities. Bands are an obvious example of a creative class that's thoroughly adopted the internet despite not making a living by sitting in front of a computer. The net's power as a promotional tool brought musicians online, and now there's a ton of free, professional-quality music available from non-professionals — and not all of it is being used as a promotional mechanism (look at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.songfight.org/">Song Fight</a> for a good, community-inspired example of music creation). Similarly, the graphics, documentation and internationalization of the average medium-to-large open source project are hugely better than they were just a few years ago. Or look at Wikipedia, where a prestige economy has led a swarm of hobbyist writers and editors to competitively product encyclopedia articles, of all things.</p>
<p>The actors and screenwriters haven't yet arrived in force, but I think they will. The net's simply too good of a promotional tool for them not to. When they do they'll build communities, and before you know it they'll be contributing to just-for-fun projects, too. I have a hard time imagining that as the accessibility of technology and the prestige of online interaction inevitably increase, the gap between professional and hobbyist endeavors won't continue to shrink.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> One of Matt's commenters brought up <a class="reference external" href="http://rvb.roosterteeth.com/home.php">Red Vs. Blue</a>. Of course! It's a perfect example of the other side of the coin: writers in search of technologists. In this case, they had a script but no CG geeks. They got around the problem by using the Halo engine to make <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machinima">machinima</a> (and, as the series progressed, grew in their own technical sophistication). If people like the RvB writers teamed up with people like the Code Guardian creators, they might end up with a pretty impressive product.</p>

The author seems to think that Comcast dumping consumers who use a very large amount of bandwidth is an example of the non-neutral net in action, and then argues that neutrality == piracy OMG!!!</p>
<p>It's pretty lame. Net neutrality isn't about making people pay for the amount of bandwidth they use. It's about degrading the quality of service in a way that favors one business over another. Pretending that the two are the same is like arguing that because I can order as much food as I want in a restaurant, I should also be able to pay to make other customers' portions smaller or their waiters surlier. There have been a lot of attempts to confuse people in this manner, but this has got to be among the weakest.</p>
<p>Besides, there are plenty of ways to get on Comcast's bad side without joining the pirate hordes — try running the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.joost.com/">Joost</a> beta on a few machines for a month and see if it doesn't earn you an angry letter or two. Or try running through a few dozen Linux distros to find one that suits you. I bet Comcast wouldn't like that one bit.</p>
<p>Incidentally, the reason people justifiably hate Comcast's bandwidth caps isn't because they're anti-neutral — it's because Comcast won't tell its customers what the caps are. There's no hard limit set. Comcast just sends scary letters to the top X% of users every month, then terminates their contracts if they don't move themselves into the meaty part of the curve by the next bill. Upgrading to business service is a way around this, of course. But it's not priced for consumers (its cost reflects expected tax benefits as well as uptime, throughput and support guarantees that aren't relevant to the consumer market). Consequently it isn't a particularly viable option for most people, and they're left wondering whether Comcast is going to decide to drag its hungrier customers away from a buffet line that had been advertised as all-you-can-eat.</p>

My academically-minded friends will no doubt be horrified by the imprecision of the visualization — I'm really supposed to have done this by building a proper similarity tree, in which joined nodes become collapsed into their average.

<p>But that would've been hard! And I'd already written my algorithm. Nevertheless, thanks to <a class="reference external" href="http://bayes.wordpress.com">son1</a> for pointing me in some interesting directions.</p>
<p>You should also head over to <a class="reference external" href="http://blog.toneland.net/node/212">Tim's</a> — he's got an entry for the Sunlight contest, too, as well as a cool 2008 Presidential aggregator that he wrote with <a class="reference external" href="http://www.strangebirdlabs.com">Rich</a> (an improved version of which is coming soon to a glossy Washington-centered magazine near you). He's also written some smart Holovaty-ish thoughts on the the overlapping future of programming and journalism. To wit: hey, reporters! It's time to learn XML, regular expressions, some statistics and WWW::Mechanize (or an equivalent web-scraping package). I'm serious. The tools will get easier, but they're already accessible and applicable enough that you could greatly benefit from learning to use them.</p>
<p>Speaking of Mr. Holovaty, Adrian's busy these days <a class="reference external" href="http://www.radicalbehavior.com/5-question-interview-with-twitter-developer-alex-payne/#comment-125">getting my friends into trouble</a>, so he's <a class="reference external" href="http://www.holovaty.com/blog/archive/2007/03/08/2108">on the lookout</a> for a programmer-journalist at Washingtonpost.com to share the load.

                    <p>I thought I'd love this software; everyone else does. And the UI <em>is</em> pretty good. But it keeps forgetting my entry-sorting preferences; it gets confused if I have identically-named feeds with different URLs; and it seems to be updating erratically, suddenly finding old posts that I know have been online for a few days. There's no way that this many different RSS feeds that I'm subscribed to have simultaneously become screwed up in the last couple of days — it's got to be the reader.</p>
<p>But that's just an irritating recent issue. Far worse is a long-term but difficult-to-spot bug I've been having wherein NNW occasionally loses a feed entirely, transmuting it into a clone of another one. After an initial honeymoon I'm being forced to conclude that this program can't even perform its core function. It kinda blows, and I'm surprised to have so many problems with a well-established program. I guess paying for software was a bad idea after all.</p>

<p>I did a little evangelizing for <a class="reference external" href="http://del.icio.us/help/playtagger">playtagger</a> over in Kriston's comments, and the PT bookmarklet I've got in my browser has made it easy enough to navigate through the mp3s that everyone's been linking to. But it occurred to me that folks might get some use out of an automatic flash player.</p>
<p>So! If you've got a webpage with a bunch of hyperlinks to mp3s and would like to add a nifty flash player to it, I've written up a handy tool to let you do just that. Simply put the permalink to your entry in the form field below and hit submit. That'll bring you to a page with some HTML. Copy that into your post and you'll have a player for all the mp3s you posted. Kinda neat, huh?</p>
<div class="docutils container">
<form action="http://www.metamonkey.net/easyxspf/" method="get"><table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="64%" />
<col width="36%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr><td><p class="first">URL of page with MP3s</p>
<input type="checkbox" value="1" checked name="nocoral"><p class="last">&nbsp;Disable Coral?</p>
</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</form></div>
<p>A word about that &quot;disable coral&quot; option — since this loads the flash player off of my webserver, and since you may not be paying for the bandwidth used to stream those mp3s, the polite thing to do is to use the Coral CDN. However, it seems to be broken today (for me, at least), so I've left it disabled by default for the time being.</p>
<p>Here are some sample players that work with the pages above (Amanda and the Governess didn't post mp3s, and DCeiver was too polite to link directly to them, so no links for those guys):</p>

<li>and, for good measure, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.metamonkey.net/easyxspf/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonian.com%2Fblogarticles%2F3861.html&amp;nocoral=1&amp;html=2">Catherine's non-spring-specific but still useful-for-demonstration-purposes Washingtonian playlist</a></li>

<p><strong>UPDATE (5/10/07):</strong> Thanks to some jerk hacking a piece of third party software on this site, this script has been unavailable for the past few weeks. It should be all better now.</p>
<p>If anyone's interested, the source code is available behind the jump.</p>
<p>It's pretty straightforward. All you really need to realize is that this script handles both the generation of the code for the user to embed, <em>and</em> the XSPF playlist itself.</p>

<p>You could strip out all of that PEAR function caching stuff if you wanted — it's just there to improve performance in case someone embeds a player and unexpectedly get an avalanche of traffic.</p>
<p>There is one complication, though. The URL of the playlist is passed in a querystring parameter to the XSPF player flash object. That's fine in most cases, but here the XSPF playlist <em>also</em> takes a querystring parameter. Making things worse, that parameter can also have its OWN querystring parameters (as in the case of Adrienne's Wordpress blog). Worst of all, the XSPF player doesn't handle URL-encoded strings very well. So we have to encode all of these parameters into a format that looks like a normal, parameter-less URL. It's a pain in the ass, but it can be done with an .htaccess file. Here's the one I'm using:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="literal-block">
&lt;IfModule mod_rewrite.c&gt;
RewriteEngine on
# Rewrite current-style URLs of the form 'index.php?url=x'.
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php?url=$1 [L,QSA]
&lt;/IfModule&gt;

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>As you've probably seen over at Yglesias's place, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.quickanded.com/">Sara</a>'s got a new <a class="reference external" href="http://www.educationsector.org/analysis/analysis_show.htm?doc_id=469729">paper</a> out arguing that we're placing too much important on education in the first three years of life. It's an interesting read, and short enough that you've got no excuse for not grabbing the PDF. By the end, I was inclined to agree that our current efforts in the 0-3 range are wasted, and that we'd probably be better off paying more attention to education for slightly older kids.</p>
<p>With that said, the neuroscience classes I took in college make me bristle a little at the idea that early childhood intervention isn't scientifically justified. Kids' brains are simply doing too much interesting and dramatic stuff during that period for me to believe that there's nothing to be gained by intervening during it. We're probably not addressing that opportunity very <em>well</em> — but I do believe that the period represents a genuine opportunity. So, some quibbles:</p>
<p>First, I kind of think that the scientific case against very early intervention is being overstated. Just because idiotic measures like Zell Miller's classical CDs for newborns don't work doesn't mean that that the first few years aren't a big deal in neural terms, or that the government might someday be able to make itself useful during them. And since the fad for neuroscientifically-justified curricula only occurred in the mid-to-late nineties, citing the lack of evidence in favor of these programs seems a little harsh to me — it's a bit early for any good longitudinal data about these early interventions' impact on life outcomes to have shown up, right? The kids born during this period of brainthusiasm aren't even in high school yet.</p>
<p>Similarly, just because the adult brain is more plastic than we once thought doesn't mean that the brain isn't at its maximum plasticity during early childhood. Myelination is occurring at a breakneck pace during this time, making connections usably speedy at the cost of reduced synaptic flexibility. It's a big deal, and it's plausible to think that stimuli that affect this process could have significant impacts on the final state of the brain.</p>
<p>As Sara's paper points out, we know that the richness of the environment has an effect on synaptic density in animal models. But she discounts this by saying:</p>
<blockquote>
Child advocates also cite experiments in which animals that lived in more stimulating environments—with toys and other animals—developed more synapses per neuron than those that lived alone in sterile lab cages. They argue that these studies show that enriched environments enhance brain growth. But, as author John Bruer points out, the environments that wild animals live in are more like the enriched environment than the lab cage one.</blockquote>
<p>But couldn't you also say that a preschool classroom more closely resembles the proto-human existence on the primordial savanna (or whatever) than a crackhouse does?</p>
<blockquote>
Thus, this experiment simply repeats the finding that severe deprivation hurts development; it does not show that a more engaging environment produces smarter animals— and it definitely does not show that extra stimulation produces smarter children.</blockquote>
<p>True. But it's reasonable to consider deprivation and stimulation as a continuum, right? It seems likely that it's not a linear relationship; there's doubtless a point of diminishing returns. Extra stimulation may not produce smarter children, but there are decent reasons for thinking that seemingly-benign neglect can producer dumber children. Is it crazy to think that government-sponsored early childhood programs could be a way to remedy this problem?</p>
<p>I wholeheartedly agree with this, though:</p>
<blockquote>
Even if neuroscience evidence did show unequivocally that the years from zero to three are the most important for childrenâ€™s development—and it does not—that wouldnâ€™t tell us how, or even if, governments can intervene effectively during that time to improve child development or life outcomes. In other words, neuroscience research—with its heavy reliance on PET scans, MRIs and studies of lab rats—is meant to help academics understand how the brain the works; it is not meant to inform social policy.</blockquote>
<p>All those baby Einstein products are made by hacks and charlatans, and I have no difficulty believing that the education money the government currently spends on kids' first years is mostly wasted. But based on my understanding of the neuroscience, it does seem like those years are probably worth <em>some</em> policy attention. I agree with Sara that we're not capable of making superbabies — but I still believe that these programs might help us avoid subpar babies. But maybe that's a task for social services rather than the school system.</p>

<dd>At the moment it's little more than an idea stolen from Flock and a wiki page, but if it ever launches this will be a social networking tool I could see myself using. I could be getting this wrong, but I think that instead of creating a new network it'd adapt your browser to integrate existing ones, and organize updates by person. So you'd have a list of friends, with Flickr photos, del.icio.us links, blog posts, twitter messages and who knows what else all organized by person instead of by service. I've been ready to have my news RSS and social RSS separated for a while now; this looks like a pretty slick method for doing so. Of course, the real question will be how easy it is for the app to track down all of your friends' various accounts on the different sites it can talk to.</dd>

Its screen gets jumbled from time to time, requiring a swift smack. And one time the microphone stopped working (also requiring a swift smack). I was going to wait and see how the iPhone works out, but Nicco told me to take a look at the new Helio phone. After reading about it, I think I'm convinced. It'd be nice to know how expensive the associated plan will be and whether the device can work as a bluetooth modem.

                    <p>Something that JP and I just figured out at work: how to change a Flickr RSS feed so that it returns images larger than the default, using Yahoo Pipes. <a class="reference external" href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.run?_id=8je0aFnh2xG9imFFJxOy0Q&amp;_render=rss">Here's</a> a feed of my photos demonstrating the functionality. <a class="reference external" href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=8je0aFnh2xG9imFFJxOy0Q">Here's</a> the pipe in question, so that you can adapt it to your own feeds. And <a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/services/api/misc.urls.html">here's</a> Flickr's documentation on its URL formats — if the 1024 pixel size is too large for you (or you want a smaller-than-normal image for some reason) consult that link and replace the &quot;_b&quot; in the first regex block with the appropriate underscore + letter combination (or remove it entirely for the default size of 500 pixels on the longest side).</p>
<p>Now that it's got a regex module Pipes is even more powerful. It does seem at least slightly buggy, though: the regexes to strip out the width and height really should be able to be combined into a single operation (e.g. /(width|height)=['&quot;]\d+['&quot;]/), but that didn't work for some reason and I had to break them out. Ah well.</p>
<p>The only major broken thing about Flickr's RSS that remains is the fact that if your contacts add photos too quickly, Flickr won't show them all to you. It's sad but true — if your contacts post more than 20 photos in the interval between Flickr's RSS regeneration (or your feedreader checking your contacts feed), some will simply never appear. Drag. I can think of ways to solve this, but not with Pipes, unfortunately. In fact, given that Pipes is likely to query your feed less frequently than your feedreader, this solution may suffer even more from that limitation. I haven't tested it carefully, but suggest that you try it out side-by-side with the default Flickr feed for a while to ensure that it's not dropping photos.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Looks like there's a bug in Pipes that makes the Regex module default to operating on the &quot;title&quot; field when you load this pipe and edit it. Be sure to change that to point to &quot;description&quot; instead, otherwise the pipe won't process the right part of the RSS and won't alter the feed at all.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE 2:</strong> I made a modified version that lets you plug in your own contacts feed RSS URL (and delivers 500px images, not the 1024 versions). You can find it <a class="reference external" href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=HHvHTP7h2xGPZ1tDdbq02Q">here</a>. Just get the URL you currently use for your contacts feed out of your RSS reader (or Flickr) and paste it into the text box. Submit the form, then scroll to the bottom of the page for the link to the RSS version of the pipe's output.</p>

                    <p>I missed all of the net neutrality fun, I'm afraid. But to summarize: Julian <a class="reference external" href="http://juliansanchez.com/notes/archives/2007/03/an_accidentally_apt_metaphor.php">took issue</a> with Craig Newmark's decision to analogize a non-neutral internet to pizza companies buying additional phone lines. Cory Doctorow dropped by, <a class="reference external" href="http://bayes.wordpress.com/2007/03/29/network-ports-archly/">son1</a> posted about it, Kriston was all over the comments, and I was too sick to wade in. Argh.</p>
<p>Well, <a class="reference external" href="http://ezraklein.typepad.com/blog/2007/04/net_neutrality_.html">Ezra's</a> just put up a post about it, so maybe now's my chance. I disagree with Ezra (I think that the quality of phone service probably <em>is</em> a desirable differentiator for pizza delivery joints), but I do think Julian's being too blasé about a purely market-driven internet.</p>
<p>Although <a class="reference external" href="http://www.techliberation.com/archives/041995.php">building more bandwidth</a> is always the preferred solution, it seems clear that traffic-shaping has a place in network optimization. I'm even open to the idea that the market should help determine how it's implemented.</p>
<p>The problem is that it can be very difficult to differentiate between policies that will increase the overall efficiency of the internet and those that will simply increase the economic efficiency of the network operators. If charging a premium for expedited delivery of VoIP traffic will allow an ISP to build out more capacity, great — it's easy to see how this arrangement can result in an a net increase in wealth. The pie gets bigger, as Matt likes to say.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if they choose to deliver these VoIP packets more quickly by throttling their other customers' web traffic, well, that's not as positive a development. It <em>could</em> be the best possible decision, but it's impossible to say without a hard look at the facts. That's where network engineers come in — and where the profit motive would complicate the decision in the absence of network neutrality. That's because it'd be easy to use network optimization as a cover for rent-seeking behavior. You'd be crazy to think that, given the chance, the ISPs wouldn't try to exploit such a situation. Comcast's arbitrary bandwidth caps for its customers are already implemented in an appalling manner. The business of network optimization is not one that's conducted with an enormous amount of scruples when profit becomes intertwined with more mundane considerations of jitter, throughput and latency.</p>
<p>And that, to me, is the real difficulty in this debate: how do we encourage the competitive network practices that will benefit us all, while preventing the ones that would allow network-owners to enrich themselves without providing benefits to consumers? There are a few things that I would like to see happen to encourage the former and make the latter more difficult.</p>
<p>First, consumer bandwidth should be metered after a prepaid cap. The ISPs should be in the business of selling us internet use. Right now their preferred scenario is for users to sign up for broadband and then use it to check their email monthly (and hopefully never call tech support). They should <em>want</em> us to use their networks — that will spur them to build better ones.</p>
<p>Second, admission to different classes of service should be done on the basis of the nature of the service — not the identity of the business buying the service. If Comcast tried to push Skype and Vonage into a bidding war to see whose website would remain usably-speedy, it'd be outrageous. If they specified a rate for prioritized VoIP service and allowed anyone to purchase it — well, that would make a lot more sense.</p>
<p>Relatedly, it'd probably be a good idea to start thinking about antitrust standards for ISPs, particularly as network and entertainment service becomes increasingly merged. I'm far from an expert on these issues, but I do know that they're going to become more and more relevant. Imagine if Time Warner Cable selectively sped up the downloads of Warner Bros. movies from online movie stores. Or if it allowed only its own movies to be stored on the caching servers at their cablemodem central offices. Or if TW simply degraded the service to all movie stores except the one run by their preferred corporate partner. Just a business leveraging its (ugh) synergies? Maybe. But it'd also be a good way to freeze competitors and new entrants out of the market, utilizing a business advantage not available to anyone else.</p>
<p>Third and finally, legislative roadblocks to municipal wifi should be thrown out. I have no idea if publicly-run broadband is the model that will ultimately make the most sense for consumers and communities. But it seems obvious to me that internet service is more like a utility than anything else, and that the market for it ought to have the option, at least, of moving into a structure like the one used for those services. More importantly, the more choices consumers have for internet access, the more competitive the ISP market will become, reducing the need for regulation to keep our current pair of broadband options free and usable.</p>
<p>Even in the headiest days of utility deregulation we didn't let the water company lower the pressure in YMCA showers just because Gold's Gym had signed up for premium service. I doubt we'll ever see a similarly egregious abuse by the network operators, but there's no reason to open ourselves up to one.</p>

                    <p>Let's make up for yesterday's <a class="reference external" href="/2007/03/28/this-is-pretty-neat/#comment-1424">egregious overtagging</a>. <a class="reference external" href="http://science.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/03/29/0317248&amp;from=rss">Via Slashdot</a> I see that some researchers at the MIT Media Lab have <a class="reference external" href="http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2007/brain-block.html">figured out a novel way to stop neurons from firing</a>. The secret lies with a light-sensitive chloride channel — shine yellow light on the neurons and chloride ions flood into the cell, eliminating the potential across its membrane and making it impossible for it to fire. They know the gene for this chloride gate, too — it comes from a particular bacterium.</p>
<p>The subhead? &quot;Work could lead to non-surgical treatment for epilepsy, Parkinson's&quot;. Christ. This conclusion is apparently based on the following quote from someone at the Media Lab:</p>
<blockquote>
&quot;In the future, controlling the activity patterns of neurons may enable very specific treatments for neurological and psychiatric diseases, with few or no side effects&quot;</blockquote>
<p>Well, yes. A correlary: in the future, eliminating physical infirmity could allow more people to lead full, active lives, with few or no side effects.</p>
<blockquote>
The new MIT research could lead to the development of optical brain prosthetics to control neurons, eliminating the need for irreversible surgery.</blockquote>
<p>Despite cool CGI sequences like the intro to <em>Fight Club</em>, our brains aren't actually filled with flashing pulses of light. If you intend to stick yellow lightbulbs in there, you're going to need some kind of surgery.</p>
<p>But all of this is beside the point, because <em>humans don't have the chloride channel in question</em>. The Media Lab people are talking about making transgenic mice that would, and that's cool. But if adding new genes to human brains were easy (or safe), there'd be more direct ways to treat the sorts of neurological diseases that the article hints at, since many of them are associated with specific genetic defects.</p>
<p>None of this stupidity is the Media Lab's fault, incidentally. Their neuroscience program is very new, and while this work seems cool and may provide a genuinely useful research tool, it's probably not actually as cutting-edge as the article would like us to believe. But when you're writing grant applications you have to come up with justifications for the innovatively terrible things you plan to do to mice. &quot;Curing all sorts of diseases (someday)&quot; is a popular choice. It's just like when I was on the debate team in high school: the downside to the team's other plan is <em>always</em> that it will cause the planet to erupt in global thermonuclear war. Should we extend Most Favored Nation status to China? Well, the downside is an inevitable nuclear holocaust. On the other hand, if we fail to grant MFN we'll still all be reduced to atomic ash. Here, I have some out-of-context quotes from a Newsweek editorial to prove it.</p>
<p>And so it is with science journalism: every reported advance will cure disease, provide infinite clean energy, or revolutionize the way we work, eat and play. It's pretty frustrating — there's a surplus of science PhDs out there, right? Would it really be so hard to find one who also knows AP style? Is it really so impossible to write a story with a hook other than &quot;technology is magic&quot;!?</p>

I particularly like Arrington's take — it's nice to see people abandoning the traditional shiny-happy rhetoric about how record labels just need to adapt to changing technology, then they'll all be be rich and happy again. The truth is that technology has drastically reduced the need for musical middlemen. I'm sure the industry will always exist in some form, but a lot of the people with financial stakes in it are doomed. Now we just have to get them to wrap up their unpleasantly-loud legal death rattle.</p>

                    <p>As I've mentioned before, I really like the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.techliberation.com">Technology Liberation Front</a>. My own ability to maintain righteous indignation over the DMCA waxes and wanes, and it's good to know that someone's holding down the fort.</p>
<p>But I do occasionally find their posts frustrating, and none more so than when they talk about the cell phone market. Too often their objections to regulation in this industry seem to boil down to, &quot;If there was enough consumer demand to justify a market for having a free market, the market would have selected for it! Market!&quot; I appreciate their enthusiasm for capitalism, and it's a good reminder for a legislation-happy liberal like myself. But you'd have to be completely insane to think that the American cell phone market is open in a way that offers meaningful choice to consumers.</p>
<p>And, courtesy of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.silbatron.com">Michael</a>, here comes a reminder of that fact. This one concerns a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.freeconference.com/">free conference call service</a> that we use at work:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Dear FreeConference User:</div>
<div class="line">AT&amp;T/Cingular, Sprint, and Qwest Are Blocking Your Conference Calling</div>
<div class="line">As of Friday, March 9, it's come to our attention that Cingular Wireless has begun blocking all conference calls made from Cingular handsets to selected conference numbers. If you call our service, you receive a recording that says, &quot;This call is not allowed from this number. Please dial 611 for customer service&quot;.</div>
<div class="line">Earlier this week, Sprint and Qwest joined in this action, blocking cellular and land line calls to these same numbers. This appears to be a coordinated effort to force you to use the paid services they provide, eliminating competition and blocking your right to use the conferencing services that work best for you.</div>
<div class="line">Don't Let AT&amp;T/Cingular, Sprint, or Qwest Take Away Your Right to Use the Conference Service of Your Choice!</div>
<div class="line">We Need Your Help! Please Take the Actions Below:</div>
<div class="line">etc. etc.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, maybe it's not foul play. Lately there's been a rash of non-toll-free numbers attracting huge amounts of inbound traffic in order to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/02/16/allfreecalls-shut-down/">exploit legislative loopholes</a>. Maybe FreeConference.com was accidentally lumped in with them and the blocking will be temporary. Maybe they all resell POTS access from the same provider, who's accidentally blacklisted freeconference.com. Or maybe not.</p>
<p>Either way, we're kind of screwed until the carriers deign to fix the problem. Our clients can't reliably call in to the service, and getting them to switch cell phone carriers is of course not a plausible solution. In fact, even for those of us who use the service daily, selecting against the crooked carriers wouldn't make any sense — termination fees, locked handsets, an occasional lack of synching tools... Yes, I can imagine a world in which consumers rise up and demand an end to these lousy practices — it's just that it's clearly a fantasy world. And I don't buy that cell customers' unwillingness to grab pitchforks and torches and march down to Cingular HQ means that we somehow don't deserve the better and more flexible service that we say we want.</p>
<p>But instead of punishing the companies that have screwed up, we'll be forced to switch conferencing providers. Which, if the freeconference.com people are to be believed, is exactly what the networks are conspiring to accomplish.</p>
<p>Now compare the situation to my VoIP vendor. If I'm using an open protocol (and, since my home Asterisk server speaks SIP, I am), the decision to switch vendors is as simple as googling for a new provider, filling out a web form and altering a configuration file to match the credentials that will have been emailed to me. That's how it ought to be: if Cingular starts screwing you over, forward your calls to the T-Mobile trial account you just set up — all it'd take is changing a few settings on your handset. If you like it, switch for good for whatever the current, reasonable number-portability fee is.</p>
<p>Is that kind of flexibility really so unimaginable? And would it be so terrible to legislate it into existence? I'm not saying we should dictate technical implementations to carriers, but surely discouraging their lockin-focused contract scheme would improve competition.</p>

                    <p>I should've seen this one coming: I had a problem with my math in the similarity matrix stuff. I didn't think through the problem carefully enough, and failed to realize that a given representative might vote several times on a piece of legislation as various amendments and procedural votes come up. That resulted in a screwed-up data model, which resulted in taking dot products of vectors of variable length, which shouldn't have worked at all (Perl is apparently pretty forgiving about referring to variables that don't exist).</p>

<p>I think I've got it all sorted out, but I'll have to rerun all of those cosine comparisons (I've improved the algorithm's efficiency; it might take less than a day this time). But progress continues: I've also written the infrastructure for segmenting the votes by issue. I'll beat this goddamn thing yet.</p>
<p>Things aren't helped by Sunlight's data being somewhat messy. Some voting histories have multiple vote-records that have identical bills numbers, descriptions and dates. The only thing that varies, in fact, is the value of the vote that's stored. That's pretty goddamn confusing, so I'm just using the one that the page's order implies to be chronologically first and hoping for the best.</p>

                    <p>A little while ago I wrote a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.manifestdensity.net/2007/01/26/fighting_movable_type_comment/">series of posts</a> outlining some steps that Movable Type admins can take to cut down on the comment spam they receive. I didn't promote it — I probably will later, in a different context — and it didn't receive a lot of traffic.</p>
<p>But it sure does get a lot of attempted spam, at least relative to all of the other entries on the site. I can only think of a few explanations:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>The spammers are searching for anti-spam entries and specifically going after them to discredit their contents.</li>
<li>Maybe spammers search for anti-spam entries to serve as test beds for their methods.</li>
<li>Someone doesn't like me and signed me up for a list of URLs that's frequently spammed.</li>
<li>... Or it's just random.</li>
</ol>
<p>It's weird. Fortunately the anti-spam stuff is holding up — this morning is the first time that any got through (that I can remember, anyway), and only two comments made it before the URL rotated and it all stopped.</p>

                    <p>I said I'd have a similarity matrix for you, didn't I? Well, here it is.</p>
<p><img alt="congressional similarity matrix" class="center" src="/static/2007/03/02/20070302_similarity_matrix_color.png" style="width: 439px; height: 439px;" /></p>
<p>The Sunlight Foundation is holding a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.sunlightfoundation.com/mashups">mashup contest</a>, and I've been screwing around with the data they've made available on <a class="reference external" href="http://www.opencongress.org">opencongress.org</a> to see if there's anything cool that I can do with it.</p>
<p>I started off by scraping every member of congress's voting record, then running a comparison of how similar they were (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/44137303&#64;N00/406129174">this photo</a> wasn't taken just because I'm pretentious — I had another reason, too). This graph is sort of my way of checking my work so far: it orders members by party, then state, then district. So the block in the upper left represents the democrats, and the one in the lower right is the republicans. The diagonal white line represents where each member is plotted against themselves (they'll always have an identical record, of course, so it's worth blanking this out to show that it isn't valuable data). The brighter the color, the more similar the voting record.</p>
<p>Of course, some members are too new to have cast enough votes to make analyzing them worthwhile, and I haven't bothered to filter them out yet (hence the scattered black dots). And this isn't the interface I intend to use for this data — it's static and visually boring, and unlikely to wow any judges.</p>
<p>But it's still kind of interesting, and you can draw a few conclusions from it (many of which are easier to see in the black &amp; white version, behind the jump). For one thing, you can see that the republicans vote like one another more consistently than the democrats do — as a result, their block is darker (on the black &amp; white graph; it's brighter on the color version, but it's a little hard to compare red pixels to blue ones directly due to how our eyes work). For another, you can see that the bands of dissimilar color are often a few pixels wide (again, particularly among the democrats). These correlate to particular states' delegations that tend to vote unlike their parties. Unsurprisingly, these tend to be folks like Iowa democrats and Texas republicans.</p>
<p>Those are just my initial impressions, though, and I could be misinterpreting something. Tomorrow I'll put up a simple DHTML browser that lets you see which column belongs to which legislator. That should make it easier to see whatever glaring mistakes I've made.</p>

People don't want websites to make their browsers work in radically different ways than they normally do. Or at least they don't want them to when everything else seems to be normal. This NYTimes behavior is almost as irritating as the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.snap.com">snap.com</a> preview windows that now pop up by default on every <a class="reference external" href="http://www.wordpress.com">wordpress.com</a> blog.</p>
<p>I imagine that the folks at the Times will come to their senses. But to me the most remarkable part of all of this isn't the stupidity of the &quot;feature&quot; — it's how many people seem to share my affliction. I thought I was the only one who constantly highlighted and rehighlighted text while reading things on the web. But no! It seems that Kriston, <a class="reference external" href="http://toohotfortnr.blogspot.com">Spencer</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.unfogged.com">Ogged</a> all suffer the same compulsion. And who knows how many more suffer in silence? Man. It just feels good to talk about it.</p>
<p>Actually, though, I'm not sure whether I can still count myself among their ranks. I don't remember performing the highlighting tic recently. But I honestly couldn't say whether that's because I've gotten out of the habit or because it's now so automatic for me that I don't notice myself doing it.</p>

                    <p>I've been screwing around with <a class="reference external" href="http://www.processing.org">Processing's</a> video capabilities ever since doing a demo on it during out tech meeting at work a few weeks ago. It's pretty neat, and getting all the neater with the sudden ubiquity of iSight cameras.</p>
<p>I initially thought that there was a somewhat glaring security hole to all of this that would potentially allow a website operator to take snapshots of users without them noticing. Turns out that's not the case: an applet has to be signed in order for the camera libraries to work in a web browser. That means it either needs to come from a very trusted source (say, Sun Microsystems) or the user has to sign off on a security warning.</p>
<p>But even without the potential for sneakiness, this is still pretty neat. Here's a first pass at it that I thought I might as well post online. It's a pretty simple tech demo — it just distorts your image in a fun way. But the potential of the technology is amazing, mostly by virtue of how amazingly accessible it is. If you've got a webcam, click on the image below and say &quot;ok&quot; to the security warning. And don't worry: this applet doesn't send your picture anywhere. That'll be coming in a future blog post (and yes, I'll warn you).</p>
<p>I'm pretty confident that this works OK on Macs, but things may be dicier on Windows. When it comes to Java stuff there's always a chance of unexpected browser crashing, so please don't leave anything important unsaved in any of your other tabs.</p>

                    <p>I know that most of my tech posts are completely inscrutable to normal humans. But do me a favor and go read <a class="reference external" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~3/87934065/pipes_and_filte.html">this</a> O'Reilly Radar post. I frequently disagree with the level of import that O'Reilly assigns to various web developments, but I actually think he's sort of on the money when he says that &quot;Yahoo!'s new Pipes service is a milestone in the history of the internet.&quot; And I haven't even been drinking! Much!</p>
<p>It really is pretty cool. It's a drag and drop interface that lets you perform various web-mashup-y tasks. You can't do anything new with it, but you can do a lot of things much more easily — and with free hosting to boot. This puts the power of the customized web into the hands of everyone.</p>
<p>Here's an example. Let's say that I want to keep tabs on Kriston with just one unified RSS feed. I fire up the Pipes interface, drag a URL-fetching object into the workspace and add the RSS feeds for <a class="reference external" href="http://www.grammarpolice.net">Grammar.police</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://eyelevel.si.edu">Eye Level</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://readexpress.com">FreeRide</a>. I drag in a filter object and draw a connection between the URL Fetcher and plug it into the Filter. Then I set the filter to only allow items where the word &quot;kriston&quot; shows up in either of the author fields (a quirk of different RSS formats) or the description field (where the text of the entries lies). Then I draw a link from the Filter to the output. Presto! I now have <a class="reference external" href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/EmbAcDC32xG.HZCot5qdmw/run?_render=rss">a unified Kriston feed</a>.</p>
<p>But suppose that I feel that this combined stream of art criticism is too accessible to the rabble. I can go back to my workspace and drag a Babelfish object into it, placing it in between the filter and output blocks. I select the desired languages et voila: Kriston's collective output is now available as an <a class="reference external" href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/dkztwTC32xGuH4osphr.og/run?_render=rss">RSS feed en Francais</a>.</p>
<p>And this is just relatively simple RSS stuff. You can get into querystring parameters, different data sources, string parsing and control structures like <em>if..then</em> blocks and <em>for</em> loops. I've only scratched the surface.</p>
<p>There are two downsides, though. First, as O'Reilly mentions, there are some bugs — the interface doesn't work completely predictably. I had to highlight the filter box in order for it to fully populate the dropdown of filterable fields, and the babelfish module seems to miss some of the entries it's sent. Second, it's currently broken: it appears that the whole thing crashed shortly after I played with it (which was very soon after the O'Reilly post). Who knows if it'll ultimately scale. I hope they get things fixed soon, but a framework as powerful as this is likely on the verge of collapsing under its own complexity. I wouldn't count on the kinks being worked out in a particularly expedient manner.</p>

                    <p>Somebody emailed me for help setting up an SMS service, and I ended up spewing out enough words that I thought I might as well commit them to the web. If you want to do something cool and techy with SMS, here are the options that I know of:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>You could buy a shortcode and SMS service from a vendor like <a class="reference external" href="http://www.clickatel.com/">Clickatel</a>, then interface with their API. That'd run you around $1000 a month, plus $2k to get it set up (and usage fees). It's how the pros do it, but I imagine it's overkill for your purposes. Let's move on.</li>
<li>You could make a setup like <a class="reference external" href="http://www.dcist.com/archives/2006/05/09/introducing_las.php">LastCall</a>, which uses an open source project called Gammu, a cracked-screen Nokia from ebay, an unlimited SMS plan from T-Mobile and a surprisingly hard-to-get-working phone » serial cable (it took me months to find one that would work under Linux). A bunch of perl scripts (and a little Python) powers it all. I wanted to do this for various reasons, but it ended up taking me months and was a huge pain in the ass. If your application is going to be simpler, I would advise against it.</li>
<li>You could use the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.mozes.com">MOZES</a> service. This is a shared shortcode that provides an API (which is somewhat poorly-documented, as of the last time I checked). You pick a keyword and can use it for a certain number of messages. When you text the keyword followed by a command to the shortcode MOZES it can integrate with your MOZES account in various ways — one of them is to trigger scripts that you've written and which use the MOZES API. This is probably the most accessible way to start using real SMS service. You could probably do something similar with <a class="reference external" href="http://www.twitter.com">Twitter</a>, too (and without the account running out of messages), but that's not what Twitter is designed for and they might shut you down.</li>
<li>Finally, you could simply rely on the carriers' SMS-to-email gateways, which work pretty well. This is what <a class="reference external" href="http://www.traincheck.com">traincheck.com</a> does. It's easy to get a cheap webhost, hook it up to a domain, then create an email address that forwards incoming mail to a PHP, Perl or Python (or whatever else) script (PHP tends to generate bounce messages unless you vigorously suppress every line's output — I'd suggest one of the other two, if they're all the same to you). The only downside here is that the wireless carriers will eventually shut you down if your service becomes heavily-used. But if you just want to automate some part of your and/or your friends' lives with SMS, then this is simple, easy, cheap and works on nearly all phones.</li>
</ul>

                    <p>You might've noticed that I hotlinked those mp3s, providing URLs that point directly at someone else's blog. This is normally considered pretty poor form — you're using up someone else's bandwidth without giving them any associated (and salable) web traffic. But in this case it's not quite so bad: I used the Coral CDN to make the links. That reduces the bandwidth that my visitors will be consuming from the other sites to a negligible amount. NYU picks up most of the bill (and is presumably happy to do so). I wrote a bit more about the Coral CDN <a class="reference external" href="http://www.zunta.org/blog/archives/2005/03/29/ourmedia_sux0rs/">here</a>; you can find their explanation <a class="reference external" href="http://www.coralcdn.org/">here</a>. It's an extremely useful tool, and not just for excusing normally boorish behavior — if you have a large file on your own server, it can come in handy there, too.</p>
<p>The only downside is that it requires that users be able to send web traffic out on port [STRIKEOUT:8090] 8080, which is a slightly unusual requirement. It shouldn't be a problem for most people, but if someone's behind a restrictive corporate firewall, the Coral-ified link might make it impossible for them to get the file.</p>
<p>So to fix that I whipped up this Javascript. It attempts to load a small image (originating on this domain) over the Coral CDN. If it manages to, we know that the visitor can use port [STRIKEOUT:8090] 8080 and access the Coral system. If that condition is met, the script then replaces all the links on the page that go to big-seeming files with ones that use Coral (&quot;big-seeming&quot; is determined by the extension — mp3, mp4, mpg and avi are what the script looks for right now, but it's easy to adjust that). If the image doesn't load, the original link is left alone and will presumably still work for the poor firewalled visitor.</p>
<p>Here's the script:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="literal-block">
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;
function CoralizeLinks()
{
// modify the following line to adjust the extensions used by the function
var EXTENSION_MATCH_RE = new RegExp('\.(mp3|avi|mpg|mp4)$','i');
var x = new Image();
x.src = 'http://www.manifestdensity.net.nyud.net:8080/coral-test.gif';
x.onload = function()
{
var domain = location.href.replace(/http:\/\//i,'').replace(/\/.*$/,'');
var links = document.getElementsByTagName('a')
for(var i=0;i&lt;links.length;i++)
{
if((links[i].href.match(EXTENSION_MATCH_RE))&amp;&amp;(!(links[i].href.match(/\.nyud\.net:80[89]0/i))))
{
if(links[i].href.match(/^http:\/\//i))
links[i].href = links[i].href.replace(/http:\/\/(.*?)\/(.*)$/i,'http://$1.nyud.net:8080/$2');
else if(links[i].href.match(/^\//))
links[i].href = 'http://' + domain + '.nyud.net:8080' + links[i].href;
else
links[i].href = location.href.replace(/\/[^\/]+$/,'/').replace(domain,(domain+'.nyud.net:8080')) + links[i].href;
}
}
};
}
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>To use it on your page just save the file as &quot;coralize.js&quot; and upload it to your webserver. Add this to your template's &lt;head&gt; section:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="literal-block">
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;/path/to/coralize.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>And modify your &lt;body&gt; tag like so:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="literal-block">
&lt;body onload=&quot;CoralizeLinks()&quot;&gt;
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>There you go.</p>
<p>And, on an unrelated note, Peyton Manning's dad just said he sent his son a pre-game text message saying how proud he was. It's the future, even for old people!</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Looks like Coral switched to using port 8080 instead of 8090 a while ago (I have no idea why — they say they're going to <a class="reference external" href="http://wiki.coralcdn.org/wiki.php?n=Main.FAQ#highport">start using port 80</a> &quot;as soon as possible&quot;). Port 8090 appears to still work, but I've updated the script anyway. Also, the Coral people appear to use the verb &quot;coralize&quot; instead of &quot;coralify&quot;, and I've adjusted the script to reflect that, too.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>The assuredly-distinct-from-me Tim Lee has <a class="reference external" href="http://www.techliberation.com/archives/041952.php">a post about videogame piracy</a> over at the excellent Tech Liberation Front that doesn't seem quite right to me. I started to leave this as a comment, but it sort of got out of hand.</p>
<p>Tim discusses the case of Eastside Hockey Manager 2007, a popular game made thoroughly and obviously unprofitable by piracy. He ends by noting that he's sympathetic to arguments that copyright protections aren't necessary for music, but still thinks that they are essential if we're to preserve industries like the one that makes videogames.</p>
<p>To some extent I think Tim is right: music is a unique case. But that's mostly because the industry that arose to distribute music was so bloated, stupid and inefficient. Having claimed nearly all of the profit from retail music sales, the record companies are the part of the music industry that'll withering first in the face of rampant piracy. That's shielding the actual music creators from piracy's effects — for now, anyway. Successful but non-superstar artists found different, largely concert- and merch-based means of earning a living a while ago.</p>
<p>But the lack of a large, parasitic &amp; evil distribution mechanism (or at least one <em>as</em> evil) doesn't mean that the videogame industry can be saved by copyright any more than the record companies can (the question of whether it <em>should</em> be saved strikes me as fairly irrelevant). The game companies' business is vulnerable, too, and will ultimately have to transform itself. The wealth of DRM options available to game-makers and the console vendors' closed systems give them a more luxurious position, but with the rise of networked consoles and the maturation of a market for pirate technologies like Alcohol 120% and console modchips, that era is coming to an end.</p>
<p>But that's okay. The bloated budgets of the high-profile videogame franchises is a bug, not a feature. Look at the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.xbox-scene.com/xbox1data/sep/EEZpEZluAEYtkTwODn.php">success of the videogames Burger King has been selling</a> — they're short and simple, but they only cost a few bucks and the restaurant has sold 3.2 million of them. I'm sure they were envisioned as a promotional tool more than anything else, but now BK is claiming they helped their bottom line. There's clearly room for growth in this segment of the market. The idea that every videogame has to be a (shooter|RPG|platformer|sports game|GTA clone) and cost $60 is ridiculous.</p>
<p>Piracy's going to continue to be effective. It's also going to become much more accessible to people without soldering irons and Linux servers. The industry will respond by chasing ad revenue; by adjusting the cost:benefit ratio for piracy by making smaller, cheaper games; and by continuing to move toward service-based offerings (e.g. subscription fees in MMORPGs). For Madden devotees, this is bad news. For those of us bored by the industry's addiction to big titles and consequent inability to innovate, it's not a bad thing at all.</p>
<p>Yglesias has made arguments similar to Tim's about the movie industry — that pirating music might be okay, but that the film industry couldn't continue to produce content of the same quality if their profit margins decreased. As I've <a class="reference external" href="http://www.beggingtodiffer.com/2005/06/28/money-for-nothing-flicks-for-free">argued before</a>, I think this is mostly just a problem of imagination: it's easy to imagine getting together the resources necessary to produce a very good-sounding album, and it has been for some time. Producing a professional-quality movie is a massively more expensive and inaccessible undertaking.</p>
<p>But this becomes less true every day. We're already past the point where a bunch of friends can make a decent movie while holding down day jobs. It wasn't too long ago that getting a good-quality camera and nonlinear editing rig meant an investment of tens of thousands of dollars. Now you can do it for an order of magnitude less. This stuff is going to continue to get cheaper and easier.</p>
<p>At this point I imagine that my <a class="reference external" href="http://cruelsommer.blogspot.com">cinematically knowledgeable</a> friends will scoff and start talking about lighting design, makeup, film versus DV and other things that I don't know enough about to sound convincing. But I still believe in technology's ability to democratize the medium: the procedurally-generated extras of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.wetadigital.com/digital/">Weta Digital</a> will show up on the desktop soon enough, and the slickness of fan productions like <a class="reference external" href="http://www.panicstruckpro.com/revelations/">Star Wars: Revelations</a> hints at a promising (albeit terribly-acted) future.</p>
<p>It'll probably always be the case that a professional can discern between the work of a colleague and that of a skilled amateur. But it also probably won't matter — in the same way that readers of political punditry turn out to not care all that much about copy-editing, I suspect the film world will end up finding that the priorities and standards they've set for themselves are different from those of their audience.</p>
<p>And that's good, because I think we're just beginning to enter the golden age of digital movie piracy. As Yglesias has noted, there's a bloated market inefficiency here, too — star salaries — which can be pared down to make up for lost revenue, in the same way that the record companies will be pared down before artists suffer. But I suspect the movie industry is going to be in a serious panic mode within a decade.</p>

                    <p>Okay. Last one, I promise. Now that you've gone through all of these steps, here are the things that you probably should have tried before listening to me:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.unfogged.com/archives/week_2006_06_11.html#005044">Ben</a>'s querystring-based twist on JS obfuscation has apparently been highly successful. It's simple and clever — give it a try. It also makes me realize that my rotating-mt-comments solution could've been implemented with .htaccess files, eliminating the need for FTP nonsense and allowing us to avoid making changes to mt-config.cgi. That'd be a better way to do it, but the benefits aren't enough to make me rewrite the script. Plus, not everyone has mod_rewrite enabled, so the original solution will work on slightly more systems.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://appnel.com/kb/mtakismet/mtakismet-manual">MT-Akismet</a> is a Movable Type plugin that brings the power of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.wordpress.org">Wordpress</a>'s Akismet spam-blocking system to MT. I installed it a few weeks ago and it seems to have helped, although in my case it didn't completely eliminate the flow of spam. Considering that I don't get all that much comment spam at this domain, that makes me disinclined to pimp MT-Akismet as a magic bullet. But it seems to do something, and does so without needing supervision. Also, lots of people swear by it. You might as well give it a try.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.sixapart.com/pronet/plugins/plugin/captcha.html">Captchas</a> are probably the most foolproof method of stopping spam. But users don't like them, and in my experience they're a pain in the ass to install. Still, if you want to stymie the spammers, this is probably the best way to do it.</li>
<li>There's always TypeKey, MT's unified login solution. In my experience, it's <a class="reference external" href="http://www.dcist.com/archives/2006/01/04/typekeys_reign_1.php">terrible</a>. Admittedly, the situation at DCist was worse than normal because Gothamist's server architecture meant that comments had to be submitted across a few different domain names, which made TypeKey's cookies go crazy. But overall, I came away deeply unimpressed.</li>
<li>Finally, there are a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.sixapart.com/pronet/plugins/plugin/closecomments.html">couple</a> of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.sixapart.com/pronet/plugins/plugin/conversation_ki.html">plugins</a> that will close comments on older entries. There are downsides — people wandering in from Google won't be able to leave their thoughts on your old entries — but if you don't mind them, it should help.</li>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>We've made some good progress. In <a class="reference external" href="http://www.manifestdensity.net/2007/01/26/fighting_movable_type_comment/">part one</a> I talked about how comment spammers operate and some theoretical ways to stop them. In <a class="reference external" href="http://www.manifestdensity.net/2007/01/27/fighting_movable_type_comment_1/">part two</a> I offered a little more practical advice, providing a walkthrough on how to convert an MT site from static HTML pages to PHP and offering more specific instructions on how to hide where your comment script lives. I know that at least one person has seen a reduction in comment spam as a result, which makes me pretty pleased.</p>
<p>Sadly, what we've covered so far isn't enough. Spammers will find your renamed mt-comments.cgi no matter how much Javascript you bury it under. If users can use the form, so can spammers. They'll find the new location of mt-comments.cgi sooner or later, and then we'll be back at square one.</p>
<p>But what if mt-comments kept changing its location? We can write a script that renames the file every time it runs, then set it to run at a regular interval. That way even when a spammer manages to find it they'll only be able to send spam until the next time the script runs. It'll be great! There are a couple of problems with this approach, though:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">If the script runs while a user is composing a comment, when they hit submit the form will send its data to a version of mt-comments that no longer exists. That could be a major pain in the ass. Fortunately, there's a pretty simple solution: we'll just keep two copies of mt-comments around at a time, deleting old ones and adding new ones on a rolling basis. That way a user would have to keep their browser open for two script-intervals in order for their comment to be lost.</p>
</li>
<li><div class="first line-block">
<div class="line">The bigger problem is how to let the site's comment forms know about the changing location of mt-comments.cgi. You might recall that Movable Type sticks these values into its templates with code that looks like this:</div>
</div>
<blockquote>
<pre class="literal-block">
action=&quot;&lt;$MTCGIPath$&gt;&lt;$MTCommentScript$&gt;&quot;
</pre>
</blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">That's fine in theory, but in practice it doesn't work out very well. That's because in order to update those values, Movable Type requires that you rebuild the site. That means we'd be recomposing every page on the blog every time the mt-comments script was renamed. Users wouldn't like the slowdown, and your webhost would get upset about the system resources that you'd end up hogging.</div>
<div class="line">So instead we'll drop the &lt;$MTCGIPath$&gt;&lt;$MTCommentScript$&gt; nonsense and just use some PHP. That'll let us keep track of the mt-comments script in a single PHP file. When a comment form is loaded it'll read the file and use whatever it finds there. It'll be plenty fast and it won't require that any pages be rebuilt.</div>
</div>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So here's the script:</p>

<p>You'll notice that there's a bunch of info to fill in at the top. Most of it should be pretty straightforward. You'll need the FTP info for your webhost account — even though we'll run the script on the same machine as your blog, it needs to connect to itself by FTP in order to make sure that the permissions on the files can be set correctly.</p>
<p>The $WRITEABLE_DIRECTORY value can probably be ignored — /tmp/ should work on pretty much every webhost out there. If it doesn't work, you can just create a directory with permissions set to 777 somewhere and point the script at it. But mostly, don't worry about it.</p>
<p>The $MT_DIRECTORY variable needs to point at the directory where Movable Type is installed, and needs to do so from an FTP client's perspective. Connect to your site with an FTP client and browse to your MT directory. You should be able to figure it out from there.</p>
<p>Finally, $SECRET should be set to a unique string. No weird characters or spaces, either — this needs to be able to be added to a URL, so stick to a simple alphanumeric password. This is necessary because running the script too often could constitute a denial-of-service attack on your blog, effectively making it impossible for anyone to comment. Putting a password in a querystring is generally a terrible idea, but since the requests for this script won't be going out over the internet (or outside the host machine at all) it should probably be okay.</p>
<p>Once you've set all of those values, save the script as <strong>mt-rotate.php</strong> and upload it to the directory where Movable Type is installed (i.e. the one where mt.cgi and mt-config.cgi live). Now it's ready to be tested. Fire up your browser and head to:</p>
<blockquote>
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.yourdomain.com/mt/mt-rotate.php?mysecret">http://www.yourdomain.com/mt/mt-rotate.php?mysecret</a></blockquote>
<p>Of course, change the path so that you're pointing at the right domain and the correct directory. And change &quot;mysecret&quot; to match whatever you set the $SECRET variable to in the script. If all goes well you shouldn't see anything at all — FTP into the site, check the Movable Type directory and confirm that it now has a file called mt-comments-location.php in it, that there's a file with a gibberish name (but ending in .cgi) and that mt-config.cgi now has a line at the bottom mentioning mt-rotate.php. If instead of all of this you see error messages in your web browser, well, something's wrong. Leave a comment and we'll sort it out.</p>
<p>So we can now rotate our comment script's filename every time we call this particular URL. And the new, secret name of the file is kept in mt-comments-location.php in the MT directory. Now we just need to adjust our comment forms so that they can use that PHP file, then set the mt-rotate script to run on an automatic basis.</p>
<p>In order to use mt-comments-location.php, we'll need to know where it resides. Unfortunately, that might be a problem. The $MT_DIRECTORY value may or may not match up with the full path to this file; it all depends on your webhost. I've put together a little script to make it easier to figure out. Download <a class="reference external" href="/static/2007/01/29/where-am-i.php.txt">this</a>, rename it to where-am-i.php (take the .txt off the end) and upload it to the MT directory on the server. Load it up in your web browser (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.yourserver.com/path/to/mt/where-am-i.php">http://www.yourserver.com/path/to/mt/where-am-i.php</a>) and have a look at the output. It ought to tell you what the filesystem path to the MT directory is.</p>
<p>So! You now have the information necessary to rewrite your comment form's <em>action</em> property on the fly. If you didn't add the Javascript obfuscation from <a class="reference external" href="http://www.manifestdensity.net/2007/01/27/fighting_movable_type_comment_1/">part two</a>, your comment form tag should still look something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="literal-block">
&lt;form method=&quot;post&quot; action=&quot;&lt;$MTCGIPath$&gt;&lt;$MTCommentScript$&gt;&quot; name=&quot;comments_form&quot; onsubmit=&quot;if (this.bakecookie.checked) rememberMe(this)&quot;&gt;
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>You'll need to add a PHP include statement, then some code to use the variable that becomes available by virtue of the include. Use this, but replace the /path/to/mt/ with the correct filesystem path where Movable Type resides:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="literal-block">
&lt;?php include('/path/to/mt/mt-comments-location.php');?&gt;
&lt;form method=&quot;post&quot; action=&quot;&lt;php print $PATH_TO_MT_COMMENTS;$&gt;&quot; name=&quot;comments_form&quot; onsubmit=&quot;if (this.bakecookie.checked) rememberMe(this)&quot;&gt;
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>If you <em>did</em> implement the Javascript obfuscation, you'll just want to swap &lt;$MTCGIPath$&gt;&lt;$MTCommentScript$&gt; and replace it with $PATH_TO_MT_COMMENTS. Like so:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="literal-block">
&lt;?php include('/path/to/mt/mt-comments-location.php');?&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;
&lt;?php print ObfuscateJS(&quot;document.comments_form.action = '$PATH_TO_MT_COMMENTS';&quot;);?&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Make this change in all the templates that have a comment form in them, then rebuild your site (or just open and re-save one entry, if you'd prefer to make sure things are working before rebuilding all of your site's comment forms). If your comment form seems to be working, you're in great shape. If you see PHP warning messages showing up on the page around where you added the <em>include()</em> statement, odds are that you got the path to mt-comments-location.php wrong.</p>
<p>But let's say that you didn't. You're pretty much all set — all you need to do is call the script on a regular basis.</p>
<p>The way to do this is with a cron job — these are tasks that can be scheduled to occur at regular intervals on a Unix-style system. You should be able to set up a cron job through your web host's control panel software. This is where you manage the domain's email addresses, among other things. It can vary between hosts, but if you look for &quot;cron jobs&quot; or &quot;scheduled tasks&quot; you should probably be able to find it.</p>
<p>cPanel is probably the most popular of these kinds of control panel software packages, and it happens to be what my webhost uses. So let's have a look at how to make it work:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photo_zoom.gne?id=372926381&amp;size=o"><img alt="finding the cron item in cPanel" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/129/372926381_a4cadcd99f_t.jpg" /></a></div>

<div class="line"><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photo_zoom.gne?id=372926431&amp;size=o"><img alt="here's the punchline" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/156/372926431_64a05725d4_t.jpg" /></a></div>
</div>
<p>It ought to be relatively self-explanatory, particularly if you have a look at the above screenshots. But here's the punchline, the command that you want to run every time the cron does:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="literal-block">
wget http://manifestdensity.net/mt/mt-rotate.php?mysecret -O/dev/null
</pre>
</blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">&quot;wget&quot; is a program that fetches webpages. The first parameter specifies the URL we want it to fetch (be sure to replace</div>
<div class="line">&quot;mysecret&quot; with a real value). And the second says to send the retrieved HTML staight to the trash (otherwise it might generate a bunch of junk files in some directory or another). We don't need to hang onto the output, anyway — it's the incoming request that triggers the script's actions. The HTML it produces (or doesn't in this case — remember, there should be no output if it works right) is irrelevant except for debugging purposes.</div>
</div>
<p>And, with that somewhat anticlimactic final step, we should be done. The cron should fire however often you set it to (as you can see from the screenshot, I told it to fire once an hour — that seems like a good number to me). When it does, the necessary files will be renamed and updated, and your Movable Type installation should remain fairly spam-free. Hurrah!</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Whoops! My mistake: I didn't realize that the comment preview template can't be made to use PHP — the filename will always end in .cgi, because it *is* the mt-comments script. You might have noticed this when you implemented part two and ended up with non-working Javascript.</p>
<p>The good news is that there's an easy workaround: <strong>simply remove the action attribute from the comment preview template's form tag entirely</strong>. This will make the form submit to itself. If someone's at the preview form, they already know the URL, which means they have the comment script name and there's no point in hiding it anyway.</p>

                    <p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.informationleafblower.com">Kyle</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.jeffnye.org">Jeff</a> rightly pointed out that yesterday's bout of MT-theorizing (aka <a class="reference external" href="http://www.manifestdensity.net/2007/01/26/fighting_movable_type_comment/">part 1</a>) — however marginally interesting it might have been — wasn't all that helpful. They're right. I didn't write it in a practically-minded sort of way. So here's a shot at explaining how you'd use the stuff I discussed. And, happily enough, some of these steps are necessary for you to use the upcoming method that I alluded to at the end of the last post — so I would've had to write a large part of this anyway.</p>
<p>First things first. The Javascript obfuscator function that I wrote about is written in PHP. More importantly, the rotating comment script functionality I keep alluding to (and which will be a considerably more powerful anti-spam measure) will rely on PHP. But if your Movable Type site was installed with the default settings, its pages aren't PHP — they're just HTML (Jeff and Kyle: I checked, and this applies to both of you).</p>
<p>So what does this mean, and how do we fix it? Well, PHP is a server-side scripting language. When it serves a webpage out to a user it looks for PHP code in it (marked by blocks beginning with &quot;&lt;?php&quot; and ending with &quot;?&gt;&quot;) and runs it before sending the resulting HTML to a user's web browser. You can do all kinds of useful things with PHP — talk to databases, manage user sessions, create graphics, compose PDFs — but we'll just be using some of its most basic functionality. But even if you weren't trying to fight comment spam I think that converting your site to PHP would be a good idea. There are a lot of neat things that people have written in it that you might want to use someday.</p>
<p>By default PHP doesn't run on every web page coming from a server. Instead, it only runs on pages whose names end in .php — this is done for efficiency's sake, so that PHP is only invoked when necessary. If you have complete control over the server you can change this. But for you, me, and anyone else bothering to read this, you won't have that level of control. So instead we need to make Movable Type begin to generate .php files instead of .html.</p>
<p>Doing this is actually pretty easy. First, go to the templates section of your blog's MT administrative interface. By default you should be looking at the Index Templates. You'll notice that there's a list of &quot;Output Files&quot;. Find one of these that ends in &quot;.html&quot; and click on the template name. You should see a screen that looks like this:</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photo_zoom.gne?id=370935695&amp;size=o"><img alt="changing a movable type template's output file extension" class="center" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/162/370935695_7019159597.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>I've highlighted the extension in yellow. Just change it from &quot;html&quot; to &quot;php&quot; and save the template. Do this for each template in the Index Templates section that has an Output File ending in .html. The next time that your site is rebuilt, the index templates will have .php extensions — so instead of index.html, you'll get index.php.</p>
<p>But the Index Templates are only half of the problem. There are a lot of other files generated by MT: the pages for individual entries, for example. These share a common template — it's under the &quot;Archives&quot; tab in the templates section. But if you click to it, you'll find that there's no place to specify the extension.</p>
<p>Instead, click on &quot;Settings&quot; in the left sidebar, then on the &quot;Publishing&quot; tab. You'll see a screen like this:</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photo_zoom.gne?id=370935654&amp;size=o"><img alt="changing movable type's archive template extension" class="center" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/138/370935654_8110dea79a.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Again, note the yellow box, change its contents from &quot;html&quot; to &quot;php&quot; and hit &quot;Save Changes&quot;.</p>
<p><img alt="Movable Type's 'Rebuild' Button" class="right" src="/static/2007/01/27/2000127_mtrebuilt.gif" />You're almost done with the HTML » PHP conversion. Click on the &quot;Rebuild Site&quot; button in the left sidebar, select &quot;Rebuild All Files&quot; from the dropdown and click the &quot;Rebuild&quot; button. Depending on the size of your site, this might take a little while.</p>
<p>Okay. What Movable Type has just done is regenerated every file on your site as a .php file. But there's a problem: the .html files are still there. It's not a <em>big</em> problem — the links that are generated by MT to things like your archives and individual entries will all have been changed automatically. But incoming links to old entries will be pointing at the .html file, which is no longer the right thing for them to point to. Fortunately, we can fix this. Open up Notepad or another text editor and enter this text:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="literal-block">
# This file automatically sends users looking for .html files to the
# equivalent .php file, if it exists.  It should be named .htaccess and placed
# in the directory that corresponds to the root of your website.
&lt;IfModule mod_rewrite.c&gt;
# turn on the rewriting engine
RewriteEngine on
# make this equivalent to the part that comes after your
# domain name.  for example, if your blog lives at
# http://www.server.com/my/blog, make the next line read
# RewriteBase /my/blog
RewriteBase   /
# parse out basename, but remember if we did
RewriteRule   ^(.*)\.html$              $1      [NC,E=WasHTM:yes]
# rewrite to document.php if exists
RewriteCond   %{REQUEST_FILENAME}.php -f
RewriteRule   ^(.*)$ $1.php             [R=301,S=1]
# else reverse the previous removal of .html
RewriteCond   %{ENV:WasHTM}            ^yes$
RewriteRule   ^(.*)$ $1.html
&lt;/IfModule&gt;
# adapted from http://www.totalchoicehosting.com/forums/lofiversion/index.php/t25151.html
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Be sure you edit the line with &quot;RewriteBase&quot; in it if your blog lives in a subdirectory of your website (if it lives at the domain's root — e.g. <a class="reference external" href="http://www.manifestdensity.net">http://www.manifestdensity.net</a> instead of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.zunta.org/blog">http://www.zunta.org/blog</a> — then you can leave it alone). Save this as a file called &quot;htaccess&quot;. Using an FTP client, upload it to the root public directory of your website — the directory which, if I uploaded a file called test.txt to it, would result in the file being available at /static/2007/01/27/test.txt (it's frequently the directory called &quot;public_html&quot; that you see as soon as you connect with FTP). Then, still using the FTP client, rename it to &quot;<strong>.</strong>htaccess&quot; (we're adding the dot at this point because on some systems adding it earlier would have made it invisible, and consequently quite a bit harder to work with). If an .htaccess file already existed, you probably shouldn't overwrite it. Email me the contents and we can sort through how to merge the two.</p>
<p>If your webserver is configured in a typical way, this .htaccess file will make the server look at every incoming request for a file ending in .html and check to see if there's an identically-named file ending in .php. If there is, it'll forward the user to the .php version. If there isn't, it'll serve up the original .html. Handy, huh? Have a look around your site (and via old links to it on other sites) and make sure that everything is working the way you expect it to.</p>
<p>Okay. It's taken us a while to get here, I admit. But things should get easier from here on out. You now have the ability to put PHP in your templates in order to generate obfuscated Javascript that will in turn obfuscate the comment script's location. The first thing to do is to change the comment script's name — after all, if the spammers already know its location, hiding that location won't do us much good.</p>
<p>Fire up your FTP client again and go to the directory where MT is installed. Use it to rename mt-comments.cgi to something hard to guess — for the purposes of this post, I'll pretend you chose <em>toms-replacement-mt-comments.cgi</em>, but you should select something unique and hard to guess. From the same directory, download <em>mt-config.cgi</em> and open it up in a text editor. Look for a line like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="literal-block">
CommentScript mt-comments.cgi
</pre>
</blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">If there is one, change <em>mt-comments.cgi</em> to</div>
<div class="line"><em>toms-replacement-mt-comments.cgi</em>. If there isn't one, add one:</div>
</div>
<blockquote>
<pre class="literal-block">
CommentScript toms-replacement-mt-comments.cgi
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Save the file and upload it over your old mt-config.cgi.</p>
<p>Congratulations: your comments are now broken! This is because all the comment forms on your site are now pointing at the script's old name. If you rebuilt the site they'd be automatically fixed (assuming your templates are properly written), since MT would swap in the new script name. But we don't want to do that just yet.</p>
<p>Instead, go into your MT Admin Panel's Templates section again. Go to the Archives tab and open the Individual Entry Archive template. Find the opening &lt;form&gt; tag for the comment form — in the default MT 3.2 templates, it looks like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="literal-block">
&lt;form method=&quot;post&quot; action=&quot;&lt;$MTCGIPath$&gt;&lt;$MTCommentScript$&gt;&quot; name=&quot;comments_form&quot; onsubmit=&quot;if (this.bakecookie.checked) rememberMe(this)&quot;&gt;
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Notice the action=&quot;&lt;$MTCGIPath$&gt;&lt;$MTCommentScript$&gt;&quot; line. This is what we're going to change, so that instead it's set by Javascript. In order to do that, we need to know how to manipulate the form in Javascript. As in the Bible/Hellboy comics, naming a thing gives you power over it: make sure that the <strong>name=&quot;comments_form&quot;</strong> portion of the &lt;form&gt; tag is present in your comment form (if <strong>name</strong> is there but set to something else, change the Javascript I've provided to use that name instead of <strong>comments_form</strong>).</p>
<p>Alright. Almost there. First, we need to point the form's action attribute at the wrong place, to lead spammers on a wild goose chase. That's easy enough to do — setting <strong>action=&quot;/&quot;</strong> should be sufficient. Now let's use some Javascript to set the form's action to the right thing. Right after the form's closing tag, add the following Javascript (I've included the &lt;form&gt; tag, too, to remind you where it goes. Don't paste this in as well — you only need one &lt;form&gt; tag.).</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="literal-block">
&lt;form method=&quot;post&quot; action=&quot;/&quot; name=&quot;comments_form&quot; onsubmit=&quot;if (this.bakecookie.checked) rememberMe(this)&quot;&gt;
All of the form's HTML
&lt;/form&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;
document.comments_form.action = '&lt;$MTCGIPath$&gt;&lt;$MTCommentScript$&gt;';
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>There! Your form's action is now somewhat hidden. If you'd like to hide it further (and make use of our exciting new PHP powers), just paste in the function that I wrote yesterday and use it to scramble the JS. It should end up looking like so:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="literal-block">
&lt;form method=&quot;post&quot; action=&quot;/&quot; name=&quot;comments_form&quot; onsubmit=&quot;if (this.bakecookie.checked) rememberMe(this)&quot;&gt;
All of the form's HTML
&lt;/form&gt;

<p>That's it! Well, okay, almost it: you'll have to make the same changes on any other templates where a comment form appears. [STRIKEOUT:The comment preview template springs to mind] (see update). If you have comment forms in any other places on your site, you'll have to hunt those down, too. But that shouldn't be too hard. Once you're done, rebuild your site again, verify that comments are working, and revel in your now somewhat-better-protected comment system.</p>
<p>Next: a way to rename <em>mt-comments.cgi</em> on an hourly basis. That'll show 'em.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Forget what I said about the comment preview template needing to be changed in a similar way. What you should actually do is <strong>remove the action property entirely from the comment preview template's &lt;form&gt; tag</strong>. I explain why in <a class="reference external" href="http://www.manifestdensity.net/2007/01/29/fighting_movable_type_comment_2/">part 3</a> which — hey! — is now available. How about that.</p>

                    <p>There's recently been a lot of discussion on the Gothamist tech list about fighting comment spam, and it's prompted me to revisit and further develop some thoughts I had about the problem. Since I regularly get approached by friends who are hoping to eliminate their comment spam woes, I thought I'd write up my thoughts.</p>
<p>I should be clear, though, that the methods I'll be outlining aren't endorsed or in use by the folks at Gothamist. They've got their own tech staff who are working on the problem. And because of the -ist sites' high profiles, high traffic and multi-server architecture, some of what I'll be discussing wouldn't really be relevant or appropriate for them anyway. But if you've got your own installation of Movable Type running on a webhost where you can run PHP (most can), read on...</p>
<p>So how do the spammers work, and what are they trying to accomplish? Let's start with the second question. More than anything, they're trying to bump up their rank in search engines. By publishing comments on well-respected sites (in terms of non-spamminess), they can bump up their ranking and make more money. The <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nofollow">nofollow</a> tag was supposed to fix all of this, but, well, it didn't. Perhaps the direct profit to be gained by idiots following their links is enough to compel them to do what they do; maybe they just don't bother to see whether nofollow is in place on the blogs they target. Either way, they seem pretty keen to keep doing what they're doing.</p>
<p>So they submit fake comments to sites in droves. They do this using automated scripts — it's faster and easier than making a web browser automatically do this stuff. Libraries like <a class="reference external" href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/WWW-Mechanize/">WWW::Mechanize</a> make it pretty straightforward.</p>
<p>In truth, it can be even simpler than WWW::Mechanize makes it. That's because blogging software works in uniform ways. When you load up a page with a comment form, the form's HTML tells your browser where to send the text of your comment. When you hit submit, the browser sends a specially-formed request (called an HTTP POST) to that URL. The script sitting at that URL — which, in MT's case, is called mt-comments.cgi by default — processes the request to post a comment.</p>
<p>Spammers simply need to find that URL and send requests to it — generally speaking, they don't even need to load up the comment form beforehand. Unfortunately, it's pretty easy to find these URLs: <a class="reference external" href="http://www.google.com/search?q=inurl%3A%22mt-comments.cgi%22">here's a google search</a> that returns a bunch (see anybody you recognize?). Some spammers will just <a class="reference external" href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22powered%20by%20movable%20type%22">look for Movable Type sites</a> and send requests to common places where mt-comments.cgi might live. That's why one of the first spam-fighting techniques recommended by Six Apart is to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.sixapart.com/pronet/comment_spam#commentscript">rename mt-comments.cgi</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this doesn't last long. The new name of the script has to be available to your visitors' browsers in order for them to be able to leave comments, which means it's available to spammers, too. Here's how it's represented in the HTML:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="literal-block">
&lt;form name=&quot;commentform&quot; method=&quot;post&quot; action=&quot;http://domain.com/url/to/renamed-commentscript.cgi&quot;&gt;
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>It's not hard to write something to find blogs on Technorati, visit them, grab the <em>action</em> attribute from the form and then start spamming it.</p>
<p>One simple method for avoiding this is to obfuscate the form's action. Libraries like WWW::Mechanize don't generally have a Javascript interpreter built in, so if you use Javascript to set the form's action it'll be unavailable to many spammer scripts (although as Six Apart <a class="reference external" href="http://www.sixapart.com/pronet/comment_spam#obfuscation">notes</a>, this method isn't foolproof). This means that your commenters will have to have at least a basic Javascript interpreter working in order to comment. But even my Sidekick's woefully crappy Javascript implementation can handle this sort of code:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="literal-block">
&lt;form name=&quot;commentform&quot; method=&quot;post&quot; action=&quot;/&quot;&gt;
body of the form
&lt;/form&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;
document.commentform.action = 'http://domain.com/url/to/renamed-commentscript.cgi';
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, this kind of code is pretty easy to scrape, too. Some Javascript obfuscation might be in order:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="literal-block">
document.commentform.action = 'http://dom' + 'ain.com/ur' + 'l/to/rena' + 'med-comme' + 'ntscrip' + 't.cgi';
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>But again, this is defeatible — and it doesn't even require a Javascript interpreter. Here's some Perl that'd do the trick, for example:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="literal-block">
#!/usr/bin/perl -w
use LWP::Simple;
my $html = get('http://some/poor/suckers/blog');
if($html =~ /\.action\s*=\s*(.*)$/im)
{
my $url = $1;
$url =~ s/['&quot;]\s*\+\s*['&quot;]//gx; # collapse the string
$url =~ s/(^['&quot;]\s*|['&quot;]\s*;?$)//gx; # clean up leading and trailing quotes
print &quot;$url\n&quot;;
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>It might return a few false positives, but it'd do the trick. Spammers don't care much about false positives, anyway. HTTP POSTs are cheap.</p>
<p>But there are better ways to obfuscate Javascript. I wrote this one last night. There are many like it, but this one is mine (and would go after the form tag, as before). It's fairly pointless — the next step in the arms race is for the spammers to use a JS interpreter, which would beat it — but I felt like writing it, so I did. I think it's a pretty good one, as these things go.</p>
<p>(As a sidenote, I <em>really</em> like doing this sort of <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaprogramming">metaprogramming</a> — writing one program through the use of another. I'm not the type of geek who gets very excited about unit tests or polymorphism, but these kinds of tasks scratch my nerd-itch (exactly disgusting as it sounds) better than anything else. Ask me to write a Perl script that makes some PHP which generates Javascript to write a block of CSS and I'll be a happy boy.)</p>

<p>I feel confident in saying that this can't be beaten with a mere regex (okay, <a class="reference external" href="http://books.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=143298&amp;cid=12015194">technically</a> it could — but not a regex that a spammer is likely to bother writing). You'd really need a full-on Javascript interpreter to disentangle the logic that this function produces. Unfortunately, the bad guys have those.</p>
<p>And that might be a good place to leave this off. In the next part I'll describe a method for renaming your comment script on a recurring, automated basis. Will that be foolproof, either? Well, no. But I think it'll raise the bar to a level where a spammer would have to expend considerable effort to keep up with your site's constantly moving target — something that he's unlikely to do.</p>

                    <p>I've begun screwing around with my attempt at a larger-buffer Hype Machine player, and became aware of HTTP dereferers in the process. Want to provide a link to a site, but not have the site's owner track it back to you? Then use one of these things.</p>
<p>Here's an example. First, the normal link, which will go to a page showing your HTTP referer information on the third line from the top:</p>
<blockquote>
<a class="reference external" href="http://c2.com/cgi/test/">http://c2.com/cgi/test/</a></blockquote>
<p>and now the same link, passed through a dereferer:</p>
<blockquote>
<a class="reference external" href="http://ultimod.org/?url=http://c2.com/cgi/test/">http://ultimod.org/?url=http://c2.com/cgi/test/</a></blockquote>
<p>Handy!</p>
<p>Of course, it's no help on my particular project — what I was actually looking for was a proxy that will spoof my HTTP referer string on the fly. Unfortunately, referer spoofing seems to be constrained to the realm of the browser plugin (it's commonly used to get free porn from protected sites), and even the excellent <a class="reference external" href="http://www.squid-cache.org/">Squid Proxy</a> doesn't seem to have this functionality (or at least it's not written up in an easy-to-find manner). But I think I can get by without this workaround.</p>

                    <p>Well, that was kind of a waste of time. But it was fun, and I suppose I learned a few new things.</p>
<p>I decided, for no particular reason, to try turning a video clip into an ascii art version of itself. In theory, this can be [STRIKEOUT:easily] accomplished via a number of different open source projects:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://handbrake.m0k.org/">Handbrake</a> rips the video from the DVD</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://ffmpeg.mplayerhq.hu/">ffmpeg</a> pulls the video frames out, one-by-one, and turns them into JPEGs</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://jp2a.sourceforge.net/">jp2a</a> turns each frame into an HTML, ASCIIfied version of itself</li>
<li>Something turns the resulting HTML back into a graphic file. I would have liked to use <a class="reference external" href="http://khtml2png.sourceforge.net/">khtml2png</a>, but I couldn't get it to work. I tried a few other things, but none of them worked, either. I ended up using <a class="reference external" href="http://www.paulhammond.org/webkit2png/">webkit2png</a>. But it was still a pain in the ass to get working, and it only works on OS X. Bah!</li>
<li>Used the convert tool from the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.imagemagick.org/">ImageMagick</a> package to crop and convert the file back to a JPEG.</li>
<li>ffmpeg puts everything back together</li>
</ul>
<p>All of the above occurs in different phases on my mac and a linux machine, and various parts are held together by some Perl.</p>
<p>I chose the opening scene of <em>The Big Lebowski</em> for my test, but it ended up being a bad choice: I thought that the closeups of all the bowling paraphenalia would be easy to recognize, but something with a lot of human faces might've been a better idea. Also, ffmpeg seems to fail at putting audio back onto Flash video — I'm not sure what that's all about, since I was able to add the audio back when trying it with different formats. If anybody's got any idea what's going on, let me know.</p>
<p>At any rate, here are the fruits of my labor. It's somewhat neat, but probably not something I'll waste a lot more time on. The effect would probably look a lot better on fullscreen, uncompressed video — but that's not really my arena. For what it's worth, the effect works best during the scenes in the middle of the clip.</p>
<p>Oh! The embedded flash video player I'm using is from <a class="reference external" href="http://www.jeroenwijering.com/?item=Flash_Video_Player">here</a>, and seems to be fairly slick. Also: if you can't see the video, it's because I'm hosting it through the coral CDN. If your firewall at work doesn't let port 8090 through, you're SOL. Don't worry: like I said, it's not exactly life-changing.</p>
<p>I think I'd probably get much better results with a cartoon, especially if I did some preprocessing to crank up the video's saturation and brightness before feeding it to jp2a. But until I've got a clean linux system (or a genuine need) I don't think I'll bother — the khtml2png solution is the right way to do screencaps. webkit2png not only requires me to pull all the files onto a mac, it makes the system's dock undulate in an oddly sensual manner as the related icon pops in and out of it for every file that's processed. It's disturbing.</p>

It's <em>Serenity</em>, the same disc used in the AACS-cracking proof of concept that I discussed at length last week. There's a very small chance that <em>Serenity's</em> key was obtained through non-technical means, and that the breach is therefore confined to that disc. But I wouldn't bet on it.</p>
<p>So this makes it official: the genie is out of the bottle. What's more, it now looks like the use of PowerDVD in the the original cracker's demonstration video may have been a red herring. If that's the case, then the HD-DVD consortium is going to be scrambling to figure out what the vulnerability actually is so that they can revoke the appropriate key (assuming that key revocation can fix the vulnerability).</p>
<p>The HD-DVD folks may yet recover from this. But until they do, DRM on the HD-DVD format should be considered dead.</p>

                    <p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.informationleafblower.com">Kyle</a> was at the Post blogger summit last night, too, but he came away with some <a class="reference external" href="http://www.informationleafblower.com/blog/archives/2007/01/to_the_summitan.html">different impressions</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">All the tech geeks in the room started tearing The Post's new feature apart (even though it's still in development and not online yet!) because it didn't have things like geocoding.</div>
<div class="line">... Does anyone give a shit about geocoding? I certainly don't. Do I need to know what blogs about U Street are actually written in apartments on U Street? Seems like a tool for stalkers more than anything else.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Ah, but you <em>should</em> give a shit about it, Kyle, because it's <strong>great</strong>. Or at least it has the potential to be.</p>
<p>The point of assigning a precise latitude and longitude to a blog isn't to provide useless data like how far from U Street someone lives. It's to provide an objective, universal way of determining location.</p>
<p>Yes, the Post will split up its list of blogs by neighborhood. That'll be useful enough within the Post site. But what about when you want another system to talk to it? Does System X use the same boundaries for Shaw as the Post does? Do they call the area near the Verizon Center Chinatown or Gallery Place or both? Are any neighborhoods divided into north/south or east/west distinctions, and are those divisions the same across the platforms? Do either of them recognize <a class="reference external" href="http://www.dcist.com/archives/2005/12/09/midwho.php">Midcity</a> as a real area?</p>
<p>Latitude and longitude are a language that every system can speak. Without them, you have to write code to account for the differences between each system — code that will break as soon as someone decides to make a minor change to their categorization system.</p>
<p>Hopefully you're convinced that geocoding is important for system interoperability. But why is interoperability important? Well, because the coming location-aware future is going to be really, really cool. Imagine that there's a fire in Columbia Heights, and bloggers located near it are instantly emailed and asked for any impressions they might have. Or think about <a class="reference external" href="http://www.zillow.com/">Zillow</a> providing links to blogs in a property's neighborhood. Or a geocoded story on washingtonpost.com featuring links to writers in the neighborhood. Or a survey of bloggers across the city asking how well a particular city service is delivered in their neighborhood. You might be able to accomplish some of these tasks with a combination of Google and patience, but geocoding would make them all simpler, faster and more reliable.</p>
<p>In short, geocoding is something that non-geeks don't have to worry about, but shouldn't belittle or fight. It's going to allow my fellow dorks to deliver a lot of fairly amazing applications. Geocoded information may not be interesting to humans in its raw form — I think we're all pretty sick of Google Maps mashups by now — but the things that computers can do with it are downright fascinating.</p>

<p>The creator's <a class="reference external" href="http://cell-ular.com/">other project</a> is pretty cool, too — it uses <a class="reference external" href="http://www.processing.org">Processing</a> and cameraphones and image recognition to an interesting effect.

With the number of bars and clubs that have prominent video displays, the low cost of the software (and VoIP service) and the ubiquity of cell phones, I really think a fun business could be made out of creating and selling machines that offer this kind of ad-hoc head-to-head gaming. I know I'd enjoy watching a projection of a few people play a game of Bomberman while waiting for the next band set up at a 9:30 show.

                    <p>Kriston's <a class="reference external" href="http://grammarpolice.net/archives/001166.php">upset</a> that Fairfax libraries are using their shelf space for popular flashes-in-the-pan, rather than stocking classics like <em>The Sound and the Fury</em>. And I guess I agree with him. Mostly. But the thing is, libraries shouldn't <em>have</em> to make this choice.</p>
<p>Before I go any further I should emphasize the considerable depths of my philistinism. When Kriston and I talk about art it usually goes like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><strong>K:</strong> Of course, all of the most important pieces from the last century have never actually been seen, in keeping with their creators' wishes. Observation is rape.</div>
<div class="line"><strong>T:</strong> I don't understand why we can't just print out the wallpapers that come with Windows, throw 'em in some frames from Target and be happy with that.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>I do side with Kriston on this one, though. But I think that the real problem here is the limit on ways in which you can get <em>The Sound and the Fury</em>. Assuming that nobody objects to a paternalistic approach to filling the library's shelves (we're all friendly liberals here, right?), this debate is really just a simple utilitarian argument over quality and quantity. How much of a shelf goes to infrequently used but valuable books, and how much to frequently used crap?</p>
<p>I think the way out of this tedious calculation lies in Kriston's closing barb:</p>
<blockquote>
We could just set up YouTube terminals. Dick in a box! Dick in a box for everyone. Let's throw italics around Dick in a Box.</blockquote>
<p>I can't say I remember whether AP style calls for italicizing the titles of YouTube clips, but, as you might expect (and as with all things), I think that &quot;more computers&quot; is roughly the right direction to take. <a class="reference external" href="http://www.forrester.com/ER/Press/Release/0,1769,470,FF.html">On-demand-printing</a> (or downloading to e-book reader) is coming — really, it ought to be in county libraries as rich as Fairfax's right now. But there's a problem.</p>
<p>In a saner world, the copyright on <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> (published 1929) would expire <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonny_Bono_Copyright_Term_Extension_Act">before 2032</a>. The work could be distributed freely to whomever wanted it, instead of paying for the drunken Tijuana exploits of William &quot;Wet Willie&quot; Faulkner VI (I assume). Save the shelves for the modern stuff and its copyright-induced scarcity.</p>
<p>At this point I imagine some will object and start talking about how books smell. But many library users are already used to having to deal with more easily-compressed forms of media than the beloved hardcover — there's microfiche for periodicals and electronic databases for scientific journals, for example. It's a tradeoff that has and will continue to be worth making.</p>
<p>Digital technology now allows us to sidestep Fairfax's dilemma entirely. And it's a good thing, too: libraries have limitations that our technology does not. In fact, the only thing libraries really have going for them is that tradition allows them to exist outside the screwed-up intellectual property regime that governs the rest of our society. The best solution here isn't to fret over patching up the library, it's to set loose the internet. You're reading this online, for god's sake. Consider just how quaint the idea of rationing information has become.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Julian <a class="reference external" href="http://juliansanchez.com/notes/archives/2007/01/must_we_burn_faulkner.php">says the same thing</a>, only more intelligently (and earlier). Also, he links to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.usask.ca/english/faulkner/main/index.html">an online edition</a> of <em>TS&amp;TF</em>. Huh — I thought copyright was the author's death + 70 years. Is it because the site is Canadian that this is possible?</p>

You'll have to acquire a volume key before ripping a DVD and uploading it to the Bittorrent networks, but at just a few KB of (now easily-obtained) data, that shouldn't pose a significant barrier to pirates' efforts.

                    <p>I'm sorry, but <a class="reference external" href="http://www.boingboing.net/2007/01/03/cheap_aaa_batteries_.html">this</a> is pretty stupid. BoingBoing and Gizmodo think that you can harvest cheap AAA batteries from 9V batteries (the kind with the snaps on top). If you crack open a 9V you'll find six 1.5V cylinders inside, and the 9V battery sells for a much lower price than six AAAs do at retail.</p>
<p>Here are <a class="reference external" href="http://www.batterycountry.com/ShopSite/alkaline-batteries.html">some battery capacities</a>. Let's use the Energizer Industrial Alkaline brand. Their 9Vs have a capacity of 625 milliamp-hours. Their AAAs have a capacity of 1250 milliamp-hours. Watts = volts x amps....</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">(1.25 amps) x (1.5 volts) x (6 AAA batteries) = 11.25 watts in 6 AAA batteries</div>
<div class="line">(0.625 amps) x (9 volts) x (1 9V battery) = 5.625 watts in one 9V battery</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Obviously a 9V and six AAAs aren't actually interchangeable. You can take apart a 9V and get six cylinders with the same voltage as AAA batteries, but nowhere near the same capacity.</p>
<p>A little more arithmetic and you realize that you're getting 6.211 watts per dollar from the AAAs, and 4.199 watts per dollar from the 9V batteries (based on the bulk prices). So this only makes sense for applications where you don't actually care about how much use you'll get out of the battery. For remote controls that you plan to lose before changing the batteries, it might be a good idea (assuming you're ready to carefully crack open a battery). Otherwise, it's not.</p>
<p>The moral: math continues to be useful, and secret battery-industry conspiracies (and free lunches in general) continue to be mostly nonexistent.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>One nice thing about last week's vacation from the plugged-in lifestyle was that there was a bunch of interesting tech news waiting for me upon my return. The most exciting bits:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://vixy.net/flv_converter">An open-source FLV transcoder</a>. This may be old news — it was posted to the <a class="reference external" href="http://del.icio.us/echoditto">echoditto del.icio.us feed</a> a little while ago. But it's still pretty exciting to me. Using it, an enterprising geek could grab content from YouTube (or any other Flash video source) and programmatically remix it however they want. Creating an automatic video montage based on a particular tag might be a fun project.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.xbox-scene.com/xbox1data/sep/EEyZyFuFZuIAxHIyTS.php">The Xbox 360 may have been cracked</a>. There have already been exploits related to the DVD drive's firmware that allowed burned DVD-Rs to be played, but that only facilitated piracy. Running alternate operating systems or homebrew games remained impossible. But now someone is claiming to have accomplished this feat.
The presumed route of ingress? The shaders on a particular game. Shaders are small executable subprograms that are run extremely quickly by graphics hardware — they're not part of the game's main executable. Instead, they're responsible for things like drawing the surface of water, or making hair look more realistic. They also may be less protected on the 360 than the main executable — a demo disc that was distributed to stores over the internet contained shaders that weren't cryptographically protected and that could be modified and reburned to the disc. Once hackers realized this, the search was on to find exploits that let software authors get at the main system memory and proceed to bend the system to their will.
Now someone has shown some sample video at a conference implying that they've succeeded (although the equipment they used implied that there may be a hardware aspect to the crack as well). Is this a real exploit or just a hoax? It's hard to say — when the route of attack is through a graphics-related subsystem, changing what's on the screen doesn't necessarily indicate that you've fully compromised the system in a useful way. But this is all pretty encouraging.</li>
<li>Most interestingly, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.engadget.com/2006/12/27/aacs-drm-cracked-by-backuphddvd-tool/">AACS may have been cracked</a>, too. It's a little early to know for sure, but it looks like the copy protection on the new HD-DVD format may have suffered its first setback. A user calling himself muslix64 claims to have found a way to get the title keys for discs by extracting them from the PowerDVD software.
Lots of folks are running around forums saying that this isn't a crack — and it's true, muslix64 didn't find a way to beat the AES encryption. But that's just semantics; if his claims are accurate, he's found a way to get the keys to it, which is the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decss">same thing</a> that happened to the thoroughly-broken Content Scrambling System of the DVD format (flaws related to its implementation of the cryptography system were also found later, but only added insult to injury — the damage was done).
AACS is better-designed than CSS, though, in that it allows for key revocation. Here's my understanding of how it works, in a nutshell: each disc's data content is encrypted with a title key that's unique to that disc. Along with the data, the title key is present on the disc — but it's also encrypted. Because it's short, a bunch of different copies of this encrypted title key can be placed on the disc, each encrypted with a different <em>player key</em>. If your company wants to manufacture an HD-DVD player (hardware or software), you must apply for and receive a player key from <a class="reference external" href="http://www.thelookandsoundofperfect.com/">the HD-DVD format's governing body</a>. Your player will use this key to get at the title key, which is in turn used to to unlock the content on the disc. It's sort of like those little boxes that realtors keeps on the doorknobs of houses that are for sale: if you want to look at the house, you enter a combination and get its key out. Each realtor could get a unique combination, but each property only needs one key. I may be drastically wrong about this analogy — I don't know that much about how realtors operate. But this is how HD-DVD does.
The advantage of this system is that if one player is compromised, the format's protection isn't totally boned. Instead, the HD-DVD consortium identifies the player and stops putting the version of the title key encrypted with that player's key on all discs that are pressed in the future. So if a player is compromised, every disc created prior to that date can be cracked, but all the ones produced in the future won't be. And the player manufacturer will have to get a new key (assuming the HD-DVD consortium is willing to give them another one).
Another thing to realize: you own your computer's RAM, and with the right software you can get at any of its contents. So when you run a program that plays an HD-DVD successfully, it means that somewhere in your system is that player's key, and, during the program's run, the disc's unencrypted title key. There are various ways of obscuring these keys and getting them out of memory as quickly as possible, but with enough [STRIKEOUT:monkeys] nerds and [STRIKEOUT:typewriters] debuggers, you'll eventually find it.
That seems to be what's happened. With the DVD format it was Xing's player that leaked its key — and under the DVD protection scheme there was no way to revoke the key. With HD-DVD it appears to be the PowerDVD program that's been compromised, and its key can and probably will be revoked. So this crack probably won't work with discs released in the future.
But it's also likely that more software players will have their keys stolen. The only way to avoid that is to stop issuing keys to software players, or to force everyone to use a <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_computing">trusted computing</a> hardware platform, which would prevent users from indiscriminately accessing their systems' memory (this is why geeks hate &amp; fear the idea of a TC initiative).
The real fun will happen when a hardware player's key is leaked and revoked (it's considerably harder to get at hardware keys, but with the right equipment and expertise it can usually be done). Everyone who's bought the player in question will be left with a box that can't play any new movies. Odds are that consumers won't be very pleased with this development. If I had to put money on a single event decisively turning the public against DRM, I'd put it on this.</li>

                    <p>Hi everybody. Well, the New Year's party is only a few hours away, and vacation is winding down. Going into this time off I had grand, bloggy plans, nearly all of which went completely ignored and unfulfilled. Among my intended projects:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Fixing my <a class="reference external" href="/2006/12/19/do-me-a-favor/">full-text RSS thingamajig</a>. I ended up not touching a line of code. I'll get to it eventually.</li>
<li>Building an extension cord that could toggle itself on and off based on input from my Arduino (the original plan was to have some Christmas lights blink a yule-appropriate message in Morse Code). I put some time into this one, but although I managed not to electrocute myself or blow any circuit breakers (to my astonishment/disappointment), I appear not to understand how transistors work very well. The relay assembly seems to work pretty well, and the Morse Code program blinks the Arduino's pin 13 LED reliably, but the transistor doesn't seem to do anything despite the input to its base. Anyone who's even slightly competent at electronics is hereby begged to have a quick look at the following diagram. I know I'm missing a protection diode across the relay coil, but I kind of doubt that's the source of the problem. Maybe, though! I'm just piecing this stuff together from the internet and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Practical-Electronics-Inventors-Paul-Scherz/dp/0070580782/sr=8-2/qid=1167601484/ref=pd_bbs_2/105-1151806-0209230?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books">this book</a>, and consequently I'm probably making some obvious mistakes.
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/44137303&#64;N00/340044058"><img alt="circuit diagram" class="center" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/156/340044058_60fb84fa16.jpg" /></a>
<strong>UPDATE:</strong> Thanks to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/11328208&#64;N00/">anachrocomputer</a>, who figured out the problem for me in the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/44137303&#64;N00/340044058">comments</a> on the photo. I'd accidentally made an <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emitter_follower">emitter follower</a> (aka common collector) circuit, which resulted in the transistor only allowing through as much voltage as was applied to its base — in this case, the Arduino's ~5 volts. The result was that the relay (which requires 12V) wouldn't fire. Whoops!</li>
<li>My Javascript-powered automatic illustration doohickey: untouched!</li>
<li>My Tetris project: well, finished before leaving work, actually. But the demonstration video: unproduced!</li>
<li>And I'm pretty sure I've forgotten about a couple of other things I meant to do. Oh well. They probably weren't that great, anyway.</li>
</ul>
<p>I did accomplish <a class="reference external" href="http://www.movering.com/node/303">one</a> or <a class="reference external" href="http://www.dcist.com/archives/photos/">two</a> small things, but mostly I just sat around, played with the Wii and worked to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.metroid.com/prime2/main.htm">liberate Aether from the dreaded Ing</a> (and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.unfogged.com/archives/week_2006_12_24.html#006015">hanging out with internet weirdos</a>, of course). It's been a pretty unproductive break. But after a year without a real vacation, I think that's exactly what I needed.</p>

                    <p>And help me test out a project I'm working on. The number of excerpt-only RSS feeds in my reader has finally hit the point where it began gnawing away at me. So I've taken a stab at writing a utility to automatically turn partial RSS feeds into full-text ones. If you've got any partial-text feeds that have been bugging you, I'd appreciate your giving it a try. If you run into problems, leave them in comments.</p>
<div class="docutils container">
<form action="http://www.metamonkey.net/fulltextrss/" method="get"><p>RSS Feed URL</p>
</form></div>
<p>Be forewarned: it's far from perfect. There are some sites that it can't figure out — perhaps unsurprisingly, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.wizznutzz.com">Wizznutzz</a> is one of them. In other cases it'll include duplicate titles, or unnecessary dates, or irrelevant parts of the site design. And sometimes it reports that full-text retrieval has failed when in fact it was just a very short entry. Oh! It also won't be able to tell when an item has been updated.</p>
<p>But ignore all of that. I'm interested to know the cases (like Wizznutzz) where it fails completely. Functionality first, then beauty. Well, actually, functionality then optimization then <em>maybe</em> beauty — a general-purpose solution isn't likely to ever make every feed look lovely. More important is the fact that it's dog-slow when it's not serving cached content. If I leave it running on this server all hell will eventually break loose. So consider this just for testing — I'll get it to a stable point sometime soon, then move it to a more permanent residence.</p>

                    <p>I've got a couple of projects in the works centering around novel interfaces — specifically, some hijinks with Asterisk and my poor, neglected <a class="reference external" href="http://www.arduino.cc">Arduino</a>. The only problem with this is that it means I have to have something to interface with. Drat.</p>
<p>So, to resolve this issue I went ahead and wrote an implementation of Tetris in <a class="reference external" href="http://www.processing.org">Processing</a>. Since that's kind of boring, I spent some additional time (okay, a lot of additional time) rewriting my one original contribution to the field of Tetrology: a fancy sinusoidal effect that I came up with in high school (let's hear it for Pascal!). I hope you'll find it as confusing as I do.</p>
<p>Of course, based on early reports from my expert beta tester[STRIKEOUT:s], there's a fairly decent chance that this will crash your browser. If it already has, uh, sorry. I'm sure you'll take comfort in the fact that it runs fine on my machines.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> That's enough browser crashing for one day. I've moved the applet below the fold so that this website doesn't mean instant death for affected users. It's weird that this is happening — I don't think I'm doing anything <em>too</em> exotic. And I'd expect Processing to protect me from causing these kinds of crashes (and expect the Java VM, upon which it's based, to offer further protection). I guess that's not the case. Well, maybe a future release of Processing will produce better results. Sorry for the inconvenience.</p>

Seems plausible to me — nothing lasts forever, right? But it's not all going away. Sure, there are people who think that learning to use the Google Maps API constitutes a meaningful contribution to society, and they are in for a rude awakening. But Google will still be around, as will Yahoo, as will well-developed Javascript technologies and the open-API concept that have powered Web 2.0.</p>

<li><p class="first">On the other hand, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.blogmaverick.com/2006/11/28/a-little-ditty-about-web-video-and-hdtv/">this</a> Mark Cuban post is dead wrong. Cuban argues that the growth of HDTV and simultaneous lack of hi-def outputs on PCs means that downloadable video will be unable to power our home entertainment centers, preserving the status quo distribution system. This is really dumb.
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITV_(Apple)">Apple's iTV</a> isn't yet released, but it's aimed at solving <em>exactly</em> the problem Cuban describes — and, like so many Apple products, will get us all used to a new way of interacting with technology (just in time for cheaper competitors to swoop in). Soon enough we'll all get cheap(ish) network appliances with HD outputs that can stream video wirelessly from our PCs — either from shared drives, or from DRM-preserving server applications that we'll leave running on our desktops.
Initially these boxes will be standalone devices, but soon enough the functionality will be integrated into DVD players or cable boxes or stereo receivers — just like Tivo's revolutionary DVR functionality has been. In fact, you don't have to wait for the iTV to see this happen: you can already see the low-end version on <a class="reference external" href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/mediacenter/extender/owner/mcxkit.mspx">on the Xbox 360</a>, the high end in devices like <a class="reference external" href="http://www.neodigits.com/new/body/products/Xline/x5000.asp">this</a>, and the midrange option <a class="reference external" href="http://www.afterdawn.com/news/archive/7656.cfm">here</a>.
Sure, we might have to wait for 802.11n to reliably stream 1080p HD content. And I have no idea whether the tech will end up residing in your DVD player, cable box, TV or receiver — at the moment I'd say the DVD player, since it's mostly cheap DVD players from Asia that have brought DivX playback to the living room. But then, that's what I said <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolby_5.1">the last time</a>, and I was dead wrong (Dolby decoding chipsets are now expected to live in the receiver). Plus, the need to preserve DRM makes partnerships between large online media vendors like Apple, Microsoft and (soon) Walmart and players like Comcast seem pretty likely. So maybe it'll be your cable box that does the streaming. Beats me.
But although the specifics are a little hazy, I <em>am</em> completely sure that Cuban is wrong about this. Downloadable video is going to be coming to the living room — and in hi-def — a lot sooner than he thinks. Thanks to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.xboxmediacenter.com/info_project.htm">Xbox Media Center</a> it's already present in mine. I just don't have a TV that can display it.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>I'm embarrassed to admit that I initially clicked through to <a class="reference external" href="http://hardware.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=06/11/26/140240&amp;from=rss">this story</a> with interest rather than incredulity. In short: some guy claimed he had come up with a means of storing 450 gigabytes of data on a single sheet of paper through a special encoding system involving colored geometric shapes. Some of the tech press ran with it.</p>
<p>Well, it's <a class="reference external" href="http://itsoup.blogspot.com/2006/11/scam-of-indian-student-developing.html">bullshit</a>, but that link doesn't really adequately explain why. It gets close, though. Here's my stab at an explanation, just for fun.</p>
<p>A laser printer can manage about 1800 dots per linear inch <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dots_per_inch">according to Wikipedia</a>. Treating each of those dots as a bit, that's 3,240,000 bits/inch<sup>2</sup>. Assuming no margins, 8.5&quot; * 11&quot; * 3,240,000 bits/inch<sup>2</sup> = a measly 302,940,000 bits, or about 295.8 megabytes (depending on which definition of megabyte you use). Allow for printing in different colors and you can multiply that by four, topping a gigabyte. Assume some sort of advanced printing technology that mixes colors in a way that provides each printed dot with 24 bits of color information like your computer screen (instead of just dithering dots of different colors to mix colors), and you're still stuck under 8 gigs/sheet.</p>
<p>At this point it's tempting to believe that the inventor's system of polygons introduces some sort of magic storage benefit. But it doesn't — fully compressed data looks like noise, not polygons, and pretty encoding schemes are doomed to be less efficient than ones that simply get down to the business of shoveling bits around. Think about how much data it takes to reproduce a colored triangle. There are probably more efficient ways to do it, but at a first glance it seems to me that you could accomplish it by storing two angles, the length of the longest side, and the color (for now, let's ignore how it's oriented in space on the page). The resolution and range you choose for these determines your ultimate storage requirements, but a reasonable guess would be 4 bytes for each number and 3 more for the color. Those 15 bytes comprise the descriptive capacity of that triangle — the rest of it can be figured out from those pieces of data, and consequently would be redundant to store. So, what's going to be a more efficient way of representing those 15 bytes? Drawing the triangle? Or using 0.00003704 square inches of paper to print 15 bytes?</p>
<p>Anyway, this is far from the first data compression scam (have a look at the fourth letter <a class="reference external" href="http://www.dansdata.com/danletters165.htm">in this Dan's Data column</a>). It's not anything novel — I just find this stuff strangely fascinating. And it provides a handy opportunity for me to resume my periodic evangelism for <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Information-Theory-John-Pierce/dp/0486240614/sr=8-2/qid=1164577747/ref=pd_bbs_sr_2/002-0432362-5412058?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books">this book</a>, which is short, accessible, and capable of teaching you important things about how technology works. The principles of information theory are just as important to understanding the online world as, say, conservation of energy is to understanding the physical world. At the very least, they're a big help when relatives ask you to expound in an authoritative-sounding manner about their planned digital camera purchases.</p>

                    <p>Via <a class="reference external" href="http://artiloop.blogspot.com">Michael</a>, check out <a class="reference external" href="http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061119/NEWS03/611190639">this article</a> about a high school kid who built a machine capable of producing nuclear fusion. Pretty cool stuff. And pretty abysmal reporting:</p>
<blockquote>
Thiago Olson, 17, stands near his nuclear fusion reactor, which he calls &quot;the Fusor,&quot; at home in Oakland Township on Friday.</blockquote>
<p>That's, um, because it <em>is</em> a <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusor">Fusor</a>. It's not like he just made a stencil and spray-painted a cool-sounding name onto his soapbox racer.</p>
<blockquote>
Thiago's mom, Natalice Olson, initially was leery of the project, even though the only real danger from the fusion machine is the high voltage and small amount of X-rays emitted through a glass window in the vacuum chamber -- through which Olson videotapes the fusion in action..</blockquote>
<p>Mrs. Olson probably should've stuck with her first instinct. From what I've read, the voltages and x-rays involved are both excellent ways to kill yourself and your family (I think there's some danger from neutron radiation, too). But presumably (and hopefully) Thiago learned how to build shielding for the gadget sometime during its construction.</p>
<blockquote>
&quot;Originally, he wanted to build a hyperbolic chamber,&quot; she said, adding that she promptly said no. But, when he came asking about the nuclear fusion machine, she relented.</blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Is that the right quote? Really? Because all I'm turning up on the internet for &quot;hyperbolic chamber&quot; are references to the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_Time_Chamber">Hyperbolic Time Chamber</a> from the awesome yet completely uneventful anime <em>Dragonball Z</em>. Honestly, if it was between one of those and a Fusor, I'd have pushed the kid toward the time machine.</div>
<div class="line">I guess it's a little silly to nitpick. This is a human interest story, not real science reporting, so it's not that important that Ms. Damron get things right. Still, I don't really understand why reporters don't bother to run things by experts — or at least wikipedia — when they're writing about technical areas in which they're not conversant. The likelihood of embarrassing errors seems high. So why not call up a physics professor from the local community college and read him or her the piece over the phone? I bet she'd be happy to do it so long as you used a quote from her.</div>
<div class="line">Anyway, questionable coverage aside, this kid is clearly pretty awesome, and he has now officially replaced <a class="reference external" href="http://www.dangerouslaboratories.org/radscout.html">David Hahn</a> as my all-time favorite teenage nuclear hacker. These kids' willingness to leapfrog straight into playing with lethal radioactivity is awe-inspiring. I'm still working up toward accidentally killing myself with mains power, for pete's sake.</div>

<div class="line">I'm trying to decode some metro cards for a DCist post in the vein of the the one where I <a class="reference external" href="http://www.dcist.com/archives/2005/12/14/dissecting_the.php">pulled apart a SmarTrip card</a>. But decoding magstripe data is a little harder than splashing around some acetone and plagiarizing wikipedia's RFID article.</div>
<div class="line">I started off trying to use <a class="reference external" href="http://stripesnoop.sourceforge.net/">this project</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://stripesnoop.sourceforge.net/hardware/reader.html">this reader</a>. And it works great for most of the cards in my wallet — but not for metro cards. Strangely, this problem even occurs in raw mode, where the reader simply spits out ones and zeros. The blocks of digits occur in roughly the same places, but the sizes of these blocks aren't consistent.</div>
<div class="line">I've done some googling. From what I can tell, it looks like most financial institutions use a standard encoding scheme, complete with checksums and well-known formats. The stripesnoop reader and software expect this scheme, but DC metro cards don't abide by it. In fact, they may not even be digital: apparently some older card systems are acoustic, using various overlapping frequencies to encode data (the same way that telephone touchtones do).</div>
<div class="line">Anyway, I'm hopeful that <a class="reference external" href="http://www.sephail.net/articles/magstripe/">this software</a> will be up to the task of analyzing it. It's a little more bare-bones: you hook a magnetic read head up to your sound card, record the sound of the magstripe and the software analyzes the resulting wav file. This is why I made that request for breakable tape decks — big thanks to <a class="reference external" href="http://wryandstanley.blogspot.com/">Ray</a> for providing a suitable victim (and to <a class="reference external" href="http://ficke.blogspot.com">Matt</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.jeffnye.org">Jeff</a> for similar offers).</div>
<div class="line">At the very least I've managed to get a motor out of it and a useful-looking transformer that will probably prove to be even more dangerous than I suspect. But I'd say that odds of successfully decoding a card are low. If I can just produce some weird-sounding mp3s I'll call this project a resounding success.</div>

<div class="line">I'm not sure why, but tech-heavy art seems to drive me insane. I've got an <a class="reference external" href="http://grammarpolice.net/archives/001105.php#comments">irrational hatred</a> of Cory Arcangel, and stuff like <a class="reference external" href="http://www.t11s.com/erase.html">this</a> infuriates me (I mean, <a class="reference external" href="http://andrewhitchcock.org/index.pl?page=binladen">c'mon</a>). Watch the video on <a class="reference external" href="http://www.t11s.com/fishpain.html">this page</a> and see if you don't feel the same sense of baffling disorientation that I do.</div>
<div class="line">I'll happily admit that my knowledge of art is confined to the few scraps of ARTH 101 &amp; 102 that haven't yet been pushed from my brain by subsequently-acquired knowledge about Tivo operation, professional wrestling and other pursuits important to the 21st century male lifestyle. But as a geek, I still have a visceral reaction against rebadging tech projects as art.</div>
<div class="line">I guess my objection is similar to the stupid &quot;I could do that!&quot; trope. At its root, this is obviously not a particularly good criticism. But more specifically, I'm bothered by <em>how</em> I could do that: by starting to fuck around with a bunch of technical doodads, ultimately developing some novel hacked-together thing, then refining it into something that can be somewhat-plausibly billed as a &quot;commentary&quot; on something else.</div>
<div class="line">I realize that directionless experimentation has led to plenty of meaningful art. And I know that divorcing authorial intent from the equation is what I'm supposed to do. But can't I at least be bothered by a complete and utter lack of intent?</div>
<div class="line">I suppose it's also a question of presentation: if I didn't see quite so many of these projects billed as explorations of how we interact with technology, I'd be less dissatisfied with them. Most have nothing to do with our relationship to technology — they're just weird artifacts that take batteries. Now, I <em>like</em> weird, battery-powered artifacts. But I don't like being oversold on their cultural import. To my prejudiced eye this class of work is no more impressive or aesthetically important than the electronic oddities on display in the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akihabara">Akihabaras</a> of the world. It seems like there are far more interesting thoughts to be taken away from Korean- and Chinese-produced USB <a class="reference external" href="http://blog.wired.com/weirdusb/">found art</a> than in Western geeks' stabs at willful weirdness.</div>
<div class="line">But I shouldn't be completely dismissive. <a class="reference external" href="http://www.makezine.com/blog/archive/2006/03/interactive_kinetic_sculpture.html">This piece</a>, by the same local artist who did the above-linked fish thing, seems like it could be pretty good. And I'm officially in favor of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.the-tilt.com/trees.html#videos">cyborg trees</a> (scroll down for an explanatory video). Both of these strike me as employing technology in service of an idea, rather than using ideas to justify the deployment of technology. That's all I'm really asking for.</div>

<li><p class="first">Ed Castronova is the biggest name I know of when it comes to studying sociology in massively multiplayer online roleplaying games. Nevertheless, the MacArthur foundation <a class="reference external" href="http://news.com.com/2102-1043_3-6127294.html?tag=st.util.print">giving him $240,000</a> to build an Shakespeare-themed online world strikes me as a really, really bad idea. First, it's probably not enough money to make anything anyone would want to play. Second, it's <em>really</em> not enough money to deliver a game produced by people who aren't game designers and are going to make lots of project planning mistakes along the way. Third, players may not be keen to play a game that's just as concerned with using them as guinea pigs as it is with entertaining them. Fourth:</p>

<p>No there won't, because that idea is LAME.</p>

<li><p class="first">It might be tough to deciper <a class="reference external" href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2006/10/20">this comic</a>, even with the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/2006/10/20">associated blog post</a> if you're not a huge geek. Here's my shot at it: ads in games are nothing new, but it's only been in the last few years that they've become dynamic, able to be sold throughout the game's lifespan and downloaded to update players' machines. Now we face the prospect of that in-game advertising becoming more targeted, thanks to the game rifling through your hard drive, checking your browser history and work documents and musical taste. I would be extremely surprised if there was any law stopping this practice that game company lawyers couldn't get around with a creatively labyrinthine End User License Agreement. But maybe I'm just being pessimistic.</p>

                    <p>Remember <a class="reference external" href="http://www.aharef.info/static/htmlgraph/">this thing</a>? Pretty neat, I know. It made the interrounds back in <a class="reference external" href="http://del.icio.us/echoditto/dom">May</a> or so. Most people completely misinterpreted it, wrongly assuming that it tells you something about your site's relation to others. In fact, it tells you about your webpage's HTML structure. Not quite as exciting, unless you're a huge dork who gets a thrill out of his wondrously-parsimonious XML code.</p>
<p>But there <em>is</em> something fascinating about this project (aside from its value as eye candy, I mean). Check out the credits: <a class="reference external" href="http://www.processing.org">Processing</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~traer/physics/">Traer Physics</a>, and <a class="reference external" href="http://htmlparser.sourceforge.net/">HTML Parser</a>. Those last two aren't that interesting — the third is an HTML-parsing library, and the second is a physics library (although <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~traer/randomarboretum/">this</a> is kind of cool).</p>
<p>Door number one is where the action is. How have I missed this project for so long? Apparently Processing was designed as an educational tool, providing a quick visual payoff to new programmers. And it does that. But it also provides a quick visual payoff to people who aren't Java programmers, but would like to make something cool-looking and animated that works across platforms. People like me. Check out the fruits of some very brief labor:</p>
<div class="docutils container">
<applet code="sine_dots" archive="/2006/10/15/sine_dots.jar" <br></applet><p>width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; mayscript=&quot;true&quot;&gt;</p>
</p><p>To view this content, you need to install Java from <a class="reference external" href="http://java.com">java.com</a></p>
</applet></div>
<p>Sinusoidal dots may not be that exciting to you (although I do get significant enjoyment out of using the word &quot;sinusoidal&quot;). But the fact that those dots were made with a mere 67 lines of totally-unoptimized code should be — especially since more than half of those lines are variable declarations and stuff to read in configuration directives that could've just been hardcoded. Have a look <a class="reference external" href="http://processing.org/learning/examples/storinginput.html">here</a> to see just how much Processing can accomplish with very little code.</p>
<p>Still, crappy graphic demos can only get you so far. I wouldn't be nearly as excited about this if not for the <a class="reference external" href="http://processing.org/reference/libraries/index.html">collection of libraries</a> that are available for Processing — including an implementation of XML-RPC. So you could make one of these visualizations talk to Flickr, or Technorati, or Google, or del.icio.us, or a data source you programmed yourself. There's database, webcam, input and audio stuff, too (just for starters).</p>
<p>Anyway, more on this as I get a chance to play with it. And hopefully more on <a class="reference external" href="http://todbot.com/blog/spookyarduino/">how I found it</a>, too, which is a completely different (yet slightly related) and extremely cool tech platform in its own right.</p>

                    <p>A while back I did <a class="reference external" href="http://www.dcist.com/archives/2005/12/14/dissecting_the.php">a post on DCist</a> about pulling apart our subway system's SmarTrip card. I've been meaning to follow up, but wasn't quite sure what to do. The obvious next step is to try to get some data off of WMATA media. I actually took a stab at this with the old magnetic farecards, ordering the <a class="reference external" href="http://stripesnoop.sourceforge.net/faq.html#a17">necessary parts</a> and never receiving them from DigiKey.</p>
<p>But magstripes are boring anyway. Pulling data from the SmartTrip would be considerably more exciting. But where to begin? My acetone-powered adventures notwithstanding, it's tough to even know what technology is inside the SmarTrip, much less how to access it. How should one go about figuring this out? The totally unsurprising answer: use Google.</p>
<p>It turns out that the SmarTrip is <a class="reference external" href="http://lnweb18.worldbank.org/External/lac/lac.nsf/Sectors/Transport/FCB7AB38B086D96F852568B200777333?OpenDocument">actually a &quot;GO CARD&quot;</a> manufactured by a company called Cubic that makes <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cubic.com/ecc/cctt/index.html">videogames for the military</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://cubic.com/cts/sysdiagram.htm">complicated charts</a> and wireless farecard thingamajigs. And look! It's a gigantic <a class="reference external" href="http://www.itsc.org.sg/plugfest/pf_documents/pf2004/CryptoSC-6-Cubic.pdf">datasheet PDF</a>, which reveals that GO CARDS are modified <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_14443">ISO 14443 B</a> cards.</p>
<p>That internet says that means that they run on the 13.56 MHz frequency, which means that <a class="reference external" href="http://www.sonmicro.com/1356/sm1013.php">for a mere $96</a> I could get an RFID dev kit that'd let me talk to the chips. Probably.</p>
<p>But surprisingly, I'm not ready to drop that much money on a blog post. Yet.</p>
<p><strong>ALTHOUGH:</strong> Section 4.4.0 of <a class="reference external" href="http://64.233.161.104/search?q=cache:BkRfDOdZAGcJ:www.apta.com/about/committees/utfs/standard/documents/trends_in_electronic_fare_media_1_5.doc+trends_in_electronic_fare_media_1_5.doc&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=2">this document</a> makes me think I shouldn't waste my time — they namecheck <a class="reference external" href="http://geekz.co.uk/schneierfacts/">Bruce Schneier</a>. Since doing that is about the extent of my own knowledge of cryptography, I figure I'm probably outgunned.</p>
