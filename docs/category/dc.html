                    <p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.grammarpolice.net">Kriston</a> asked <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ryanavent.com">Ryan</a> and me to write about <a class="reference external" href="http://www.washingtonian.com/print/articles/6/174/11722.html">Larry Van Dyne's article on historic preservation</a> for DCist. This was at least half of a good idea: Ryan always has interesting things to say about the business of running cities. And for my part, I imagine Kriston was counting on me to bring my own trademark brand of techno-philistinism (&quot;Why preserve buildings when we can just make models of them in Second Life?&quot;).</p>
<p>The joke's on him, though. The past couple of years' worth of Ryan's writing have been so convincing that whatever opinions I may have originally had on these matters have been almost entirely replaced with his — this happens an embarrassing amount when you have smart friends who write a lot. I'm afraid that the essay I produced is consequently just a half-baked version of the one that Ryan wrote. On the upside, I was glad to see Ryan take the potshot at the FBI building that I'd barely restrained myself from making (it's <em>so awful</em>). So really, he wins on all fronts — <a class="reference external" href="http://dcist.com/2009/03/two_takes_ryan_avent_on_historic_pr.php">go have a read</a>.</p>

                    <p>I didn't go downtown this morning. Getting anywhere even potentially worth being seemed to require a very early start, and although <a class="reference external" href="http://www.unfogged.com">Becks</a>' promise of a delicious pre-inaugural spread was tempting, I opted out. I'd gotten up before dawn the day before in order to catch a flight, making me even less inclined than normal to wake up early. Instead I woke up around 10, made some coffee and french toast, then plopped down in front of the TV. Honestly, I think this was the way to go.</p>
<p>I did head out on my bike around 1, though, to see what things were like around town. I made a rough circle down to Chinatown, over to Freedom Plaza, up Fourteenth, across U, then back down Eleventh. The verdict: there are a lot of people here! They all seem excited to bustle about and enjoy the historic occasion, but there's no comparison to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.manifestdensity.net/2008/11/05/between_the_click_of_the_light/">the emotion that flooded the streets on election night</a>. I guess for that sort of joyousness to spread to the daylight hours we'd need to be transitioning from an even worse president than Bush to an even more trailblazing and exciting one than Obama. Like, say, a resurrected Freddie Mercury succeeding a two-term Palpatine administration. Well, fingers crossed!</p>
<p>You'll be glad to know that I took some crappy pictures with my iphone:</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/3213516732/"><img alt="water damage rOBAMAration service" class="center" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3108/3213516732_c66c13977a.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: 375px;" /></a></p>
<p>Gallery Place was ground zero for nonsensical Obama paraphernalia, including this plumber's truck with photos of the new president plastered on it. Despite the street being closed, a cop yelled at me for stopping my bike to take this photo, and then again when I took five seconds to begin moving. Ah, officiousness.</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/3212671461/"><img alt="Fourteenth Street" class="center" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3425/3212671461_2b8f635c78.jpg" style="width: 375px; height: 500px;" /></a></p>
<p>Fourteenth had stalls set up, but aside from folks queued to get into the perimeter around the mall, it wasn't too flooded with people. It was pretty fun to bike through the closed streets.</p>
<p>There's an Obama ice sculpture outside of Ben's. And yeah, the line still goes down the alley:</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/3212636453/"><img alt="Obama ice sculpture outside of Ben's" class="center" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3308/3212636453_0df63ec757.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: 375px;" /></a></p>
<p>MOST EXCITINGLY: I'm pretty sure I saw Matthew Lesko walking down my street as I returned home. I mean, okay, it could have been someone else. But whoever it was, he was wearing a leather jacket emblazoned with question marks, pants with question marks on the back pocket, a question mark hat, and ludicrous shoes (which seem likely to have also involved punctuation symbols of one sort or another).</p>

                    <p>Alright, enough of this &quot;saying nice things about employers&quot; nonsense. That's not what the internet is about! It's about complaining, goddammit. So let's do some of that.</p>
<p>To wit: the YMCA. Man, I really like the YMCA. I grew up going to one with my family; once I moved into the city I joined the National Capital Y pretty quickly. It's not the cheapest or best-appointed gym out there, but I find the atmosphere congenial. Everything's old: from the unused wall nozzles that powered pneumatic equipment back in the day; to the inch-thick layer of paint on the walls; to the patrons themselves, who wander about the locker room naked while endlessly discussing squash (whatever that is). The skeptical, tentative, ever-inconclusive conversations among themerely-fiftyish men offer a glimpse into the bureaucratic lifestyle that's hard to find anywhere else. It's not exciting, but it's an essential part of this city, goddammit.</p>
<p>But they've invited my wrath. Two things. First: when I signed up, they corralled me into some sort of reverse direct deposit business. I hate doing these things because I'm paranoid about giving companies the keys to my checking account. And hey, guess what? I got a letter from the Y, and I (<a class="reference external" href="/2007/08/20/admitting-defeat/">somewhat improbably</a>) opened it, and they had decided to help themselves to an extra $25 or $50 or whatever. Times are tough, you know. They were sure I wouldn't mind. They just took it out from the larger wad of money, I probably wouldn't even notice, and besides they needed it for cigarettes so they could smoke with the seniors at lunch.</p>
<p>This left me feeling rather cross, and the reaction from the folks at the front desk (&quot;it's only $25&quot;) only buttressed my righteous indignation. But further indignities laid in wait.</p>
<p>Kickball. They're hosting kickball again this winter. Not that I remember them ever having done so before, but the signs in the hallway claim they did. Perhaps we have always been at war with kickball; I don't really know. I do know that this fills the hallways with clots of drunk or soon-to-be-drunk assholes, who whoop and don't get out of my way even when I say &quot;excuse me&quot; (admittedly through gritted teeth and a facial expression designed to drive the observer to suicide). It's a bad situation, and if you ask me, pretty disrespectful of the Y's dues-paying members, all of whom detest the kickballers.</p>
<p>I should say: I know people who play kickball who I like very much. That's the social scene they found themselves in, and so they play kickball. I can't fault them for that. Hell, my ancestors owned slaves — we're all victims of our milieu. Further, I understand perfectly well the need to invent flimsy social pretexts to justify increasingly worrying levels of post-graduation alcohol consumption. But most people don't conduct their writing workshops or networking events or connoisseurship rituals in the hallway leading to the fifth floor weight room — that's the key difference, I think. Kickball has got to go.</p>
<p>The combination of the two is especially galling. Kickball's awash in money — you can tell because the idiots responsible <a class="reference external" href="http://dcist.com/2008/08/05/kickball_lawsuit_finally_strikes_ou.php">keep trying to sue each other</a>. This is a for-profit enterprise that's wormed its drunken way into my quasi-charitable dues-based fitness club. And yet on top of the imposition-for-cash, they <em>also</em> need to steal from me? It's a bit much. The first time I run into people playing flipcup in the locker room I'm going to wind up killing somebody.</p>

                    <p>I haven't really followed the local sports media much over the past couple of years. The last time I regularly checked in, Wilbon was still handling quite a bit of the paper's Redskins columns, and it was clear that he was intensely bored by it. A professional disdain for home team jingoism and fatigue from the formulaic but necessary cycle of columns that a bad local franchise necessitates combined to produce columns that were mostly about how much he hated writing them.</p>
<p>I figured the turnover since then would have improved things, but <a class="reference external" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/14/AR2008091402428_pf.html">holy crap is today's Mike Wise column a piece of garbage</a>. It's like he was having a competition with his colleagues to see how many sentence fragments he could get past their editor. Also, take a moment and contemplate the horror of the phrase &quot;and who this team really cannot get the ball enough to&quot;. Is it possible to write that clause any more awkwardly? Did anyone even read this before it went to the presses?</p>
<p>I realize that many sports reporters get bored with sports. That's probably inevitable. But it's still a pretty cushy job — show at least a <em>little</em> effort.</p>
<p><strong>HMM:</strong> Charles tells me that he thinks Mike Wise ran a triathlon on the day that he had to write that column. If so, its quality is a bit more understandable. Presumably his editor was similarly indisposed (boxing match?).</p>

                    <p>Interesting developments on the Logan Circle listserv! Apparently the new Shaw library has been going through a design process since January, at which time residents were shown this design:</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.districtdynamos.org/dynamos/shaw/library_evolution"><img alt="image1" class="center" src="/static/2008/08/14/oldshawlibrary-20080814-110156.png" /></a></p>
<p>They liked it! But now months have passed, and somehow the project has changed into this:</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.districtdynamos.org/dynamos/shaw/library_evolution"><img alt="image2" class="center" src="/static/2008/08/14/skitched-20080814-110246.png" /></a></p>
<p>It certainly looks, um, more... frugal? Maybe those who know something about architecture will be able to defend it on the merits. I don't know anything about these matters, but I can see how some might think the earlier, prettier design is less <em>interesting</em>. Or maybe the second one really is the trainwreck it appears to be.</p>

                    <p>Lord knows we need all the tolerable bars in DC we can get, but last night's experience is making me want to write off Townhouse Tavern. We ended up there with a larger-than-expected and somewhat unwieldy group, but arrived early and had secured chairs for everybody outside. After an hour or so one of our party went a few feet up the street to take a call. When the bartender came to clear empties he pushed the guy's chair a bit out of the way, making it look like it belonged to a different, unoccupied table.</p>
<p>Some new arrivals approached another table out front that had folks around it, and one of them grabbed the now-slightly-displaced chair. We tried to explain that it was spoken for, but the guy who had snagged it just ignored us. Emily politely tapped him on the shoulder and explained the situation again, but he continued to blow us off, not even bothering to make eye contact. One of his group found the whole thing funny, and asked us incredulously if we realized that the chair-taker owned the bar.</p>
<p>Well, hell, did he? My gullibility is well-established, but it actually seems pretty possible to me: the bartenders were hanging out with their table all night, and the guy certainly carried an attitude of entitlement sufficient to mark him as a proprietor. If so, man, what a lousy way to treat your customers. I left that place pretty pissed off, and am sorry to have had a chip placed on my shoulder about what is, like I said, one of the few endurable bars in DC.</p>
<p>I suppose when you buy a place like Townhouse a large part of your motivation is a desire to host your friends exactly how and when you want. I can understand that. But it's tough to want to put money in the pocket of someone who treats you like garbage, regardless of how nice his bartenders are. Hopefully somebody'll pipe up and tell me that no, there's no way that was the owner.</p>
<p><strong>KRISTON TO THE RESCUE:</strong> Mr. Capps, a good friend to me and Townhouse both, writes with assurances that the TH owner is considerably taller, beardier and more Scottish than the thoroughly dude-like dude who behaved so poorly toward us. Sounds like it was just a bunch of regulars with delusions of grandeur. Good.</p>

It's worth <a class="reference external" href="http://washcycle.typepad.com/home/2008/07/the-myth-of-the.html">reading the whole thing</a>, but here's a bit about jaybiking:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">[A] better question is &quot;why don't drivers 'jaydrive'?&quot;</div>
<div class="line">Is it because they love the law so much? Did you skip the previous section?</div>
<div class="line">It's because their risk/reward calculation is coming up with a different answer. And that makes sense. In a car you're several feet farther back from the intersection and you're often a foot or two lower, meaning you can't see as well (I bet those on recumbents don't jaybike as often as those on standard bikes). In a car you're in a soundproof enclosure so you have no stereoscopic hearing. And if you make a mistake you aren't as maneuverable as you are on a bike or on your feet. You can't just ditch to the sidewalk. Driver's don't jaydrive because, in their own estimation, they can't. But if they could, I'm sure they would.</div>
<div class="line">Still, that doesn't explain the anger. Drivers get — I feel — irrationally angry about this. After wondering why for so long, an anthropologist friend of mine helped me to understand. Running a red light is so dangerous for cars that it isn't just illegal, it's taboo. You're breaking a social construct. Which means people find it objectionable and abhorrent. So if education is needed, maybe it's needed to explain why it's safer for cyclists to do this than for drivers.</div>
<div class="line">[...]</div>
<div class="line">The way to end jaybiking violations is to decriminalize them. [...] Idaho has changed its law — and California is considering it — to allow cyclist to treat stop signs as yield signs and stop lights as stop signs.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>I agree with all of this, although it doesn't really apply to me any more: over the past few months I've become a very, very good citizen cyclist.</p>
<p>It's not that I think patiently waiting for a red light to change is making me or anyone else safer — it's just that I can't stand the thought that I might provide grist for those who whine about bicyclists' lawlessness. Besides, the instinctive anger that drivers feel upon seeing a bicyclist is no doubt that much more intense when they can't put their fingers on a handy excuse for why the biker's presence infuriates them.</p>
<p>My traffic safety habits are now entirely spite-based.</p>

                    <p>First: the plan to move DC's intercity buses to the L'Enfant wasteland is on hold. I got the following in an email on Friday:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">The District Department of Transportation as of July 3, 2008 has suspended the new intercity bus permit regulations to allow for additional evaluation and review of the program. Originally intended to begin in early July, the regulation seeks to better manage the use of public space and institute curbside management practices through new permitting requirements and by identifying specific locations for passenger drop off and pickup. [...]</div>
<div class="line">Further details will be available as DDOT continues to evaluate the new policy.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Hilariously, the email's author appears to have simply cc'ed everybody who wrote in about the issue. It looks like they got about 400 complaints.</p>
<p>On Friday Kriston and Matt tried to convince me that the whole bus terminal project was a sinister plot to legislate Greyhound's competition out of existence, delivering yet another crooked victory to Big Bus. Key to this undertaking, they said, was a little-noticed but crucially important new rule forbidding the bus companies from selling tickets at curbside. Instead the companies must maintain a storefront — a requirement that, given the lack of available real estate at the new depot site, could not be met. Presto: no more intercity buses.</p>
<p>I was dubious, and after reading the text of the (now tabled) proposal, I'm even more so. Here, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ddot.dc.gov/ddot/lib/ddot/information/publicspace/emergencyrule.pdf">have a look yourself</a>. Section 3307.8:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">An intercity bus operator shall not:</div>
<div class="line">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;Vend tickets in the public space;</div>
<div class="line">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;Arrive sooner than thirty (30) minutes prior to scheduled departure in the intercity bus zone;</div>
<div class="line">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;Remain in the intercity bus zone for more than thirty (30) minutes after arrival; or</div>
<div class="line">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;Allow intercity bus passengers to obstruct the flow of pedestrian traffic in the public space and into adjacent buildings.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Obviously the curbside ticket-sale question would have hinged on what &quot;public space&quot; means. I am not a [etc.], but 3307.8(d) strongly implies to me that the interior of the bus isn't considered a part of the public space — certainly it's legally distinct in at least <em>some</em> ways, since the bus operators can charge admission to and eject people from it. And of course many of the intercity bus companies sell their tickets at the pickup site, but do so as their representative moves through the loaded bus checking tickets. Sometimes you pay as you get on, sometimes you pay once you're seated. I can't imagine mandating one or the other would dramatically disrupt these businesses' operations.</p>
<p>Besides which, the proposal sidesteps more obvious ways to inconvenience Greyhound's competitors. Fines for noncompliance are only $200 or $300 (depending on whether it's a first offense); the fee for renting space for loading and unloading works out to less than $2.50/hr. This isn't to say that moving these buses to L'Enfant is a good idea, but I don't think it's a conspiracy, either.</p>

                    <p>A 22 year-old woman on a bicycle <a class="reference external" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/08/AR2008070800975.html">was run over and killed by a garbage truck this morning</a>.

Why is it that any time someone points out that despite bicycling being a clean and cheap mode of transportation our cities make it much more dangerous and difficult than it ought to be, the first reaction is always, ALWAYS for people to exclaim: &quot;But sometimes bicyclists run stop signs or ride on sidewalks!&quot;</p>
<p>I'm really trying to keep this short, so I'll just say: speaking for cyclists everywhere, out A-#1 top priority is not getting killed by automobiles. I'm sorry that this edges out &quot;not startling those not on bikes&quot; and &quot;not inconveniencing those driving&quot;, but it does. The stakes are just a wee bit higher, is the thing. We're riding to get away from cars, to get seen by cars, and to avoid winding up under cars. If you don't ride a bike you don't understand, and you certainly have no right to make assumptions about the correctness of typical cyclist behavior based on your occasional prudish outrage at the antics of a few reckless downtown couriers.</p>
<p>Someday I hope we'll all be able to live in peace and harmony. But as someone who's employed all three modes of transportation, take it from me: right now irresponsible or dim-witted drivers put cyclists in danger much more frequently and to a greater degree than cyclists endanger walkers and drivers. Please try to apportion your outrage accordingly.</p>

                    <p>Matt's <a class="reference external" href="http://matthewyglesias.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/01/taxi_fares.php">concerned</a> that Mayor Fenty's reduction of proposed metered fares for D.C. taxis will make it harder to hail a cab. I'm not so worried. Have a look at the comments in <a class="reference external" href="http://dcist.com/2008/01/16/fenty_lowers_ta.php#comments">this DCist thread</a>. It's full of stories of cabbies refusing to take fares because of the requested destination or because a surcharge wouldn't apply to the trip.</p>
<p>Now, perhaps these cabs are refusing to provide service (illegally, I might add) because they're already perched on the brink of financial ruin, and taking anything less than maximally lucrative fares would send them tumbling into bankruptcy. But I have my doubts. By all accounts the taxi commission in this city has been unusually powerful for an unusually long time. And although I don't know how hard D.C. cabbies work relative to their peers in other cities, I can say with certainty that cabs in Philadelphia are cheaper, easier to hail, more convenient (you can pay with credit cards!) and generally better maintained. I could be mistaken, but it certainly <em>seems</em> like D.C. cabs have been operating as a cartel, isolated from true competitive pressure and, in general, enjoying something of a sweetheart deal.</p>
<p>I admit, I'm a little hesitant to make this criticism. Although I strongly suspect that driving a taxi in D.C. is a better job than driving one elsewhere, I'm absolutely positive that being a software developer in D.C. is a better job than either. But although I'm sorry to advocate making cab operators' lives harder, I also have a pretty strong sense of resentment over how many times I've emerged from a Washington taxi feeling ripped off — I'd put it at about 50% of my trips, whether from dubious surcharges, phantom zones springing to life or the driver's insistence that he only ever carries $2 in change.</p>
<p>The obvious caveat to all of this is Washington's size. It's a small city — maybe expecting an efficient taxi system in such a small space is unrealistic. But although the city is small, the metropolitan area is large. If D.C. cabbies really can't make a living charging New York prices, the answer is simple: start allowing Virginia and Maryland taxis into the District and, if possible, vice versa.</p>
<p>At that point you might have an efficiently operating market for taxi service — and at that point I think it'd be safe to start worrying about the system reacting to manipulation in straightforward economic ways. But at the moment I seriously doubt that the factors constraining the supply of taxis in this town have anything to do with price.</p>

                    <p>As someone who has to think about how to write DCist Morning Roundup introductions on a somewhat regular basis, I feel that I can say this with confidence: there are only so many ways to whimsically express the idea that Washingtonians are bad at driving in snow. But that doesn't make it the underlying fact any less true, as <a class="reference external" href="http://blogstretch.blogspot.com/2007/12/oh-what-dummy-full-moooorning.html">Amanda can attest</a>.</p>
<p>I can attest to it, too. Riding my bike this morning, I coasted down the left-hand side of M Street, in the gap between the traffic and parked cars. The light was red but clearly about to change. Suddenly the driver's side door of the car one length in front and to the right of me began to swing open, and a leg emerged. I skidded to a halt, cursed and glared at the driver.</p>
<p>But his face was totally blank, uncomprehending, and remained so as he slowly reversed his motions. Why <em>shouldn't</em> he suddenly abandon his car and start wandering around as the light changed? It's still locomotion, after all. And in this dumbfounding urban hallucination, where even frozen water can fall from the sky, who's to say that one way of navigating the dreamscape is more valid than another?</p>

                    <p>Apologies for the terrible video quality, but I can't help posting a pet peeve of mine: the lack of standards for walk/don't walk signs at intersections. The countdown timers are great, but it's impossible to know at which point during the countdown the light will change to yellow.</p>
<p>This video is from the south edge of Logan Circle — an intersection I bike through every day. You can see that in one direction the light turns yellow when the countdown is at zero; in the other, the light turns yellow around &quot;5&quot; and is red at zero. This inconsistency seems dangerous.</p>

</center></p><p>Let's face it: if you're on a bike or in a car you'll occasionally find yourself trying to make a light. We can pretend that the stoplight should be the sole direction for vehicle operators, but that's a bit silly: the countdown timers are clearly an irresistible source of information that can be used to determine whether it's possible to get through an intersection safely. When they occasionally behave in unexpected ways, it's a genuine hazard.</p>
<p>I'm speaking from experience. Back in high school I was hit by a car while on my bike thanks to a combination of my own stupidity and a non-standard &quot;don't walk&quot; indicator. The overall dumbness of my teenage boy self was admittedly the driving factor. But that's hard to correct — it would've been a lot easier to properly program the signal so that the solid-red-hand had corresponded with the usual pause-at-yellow instead of green-means-go.</p>

                    <p>I woke up this morning to the banality of jackhammers. Construction crews were tearing up the street, redoing the lousy, lumpy patch job left by the workers who'd replaced our lead water pipes weeks ago. There was a $50 ticket on the hood of my mercifully un-towed rental car — my fault, I'd forgotten about the paper &quot;No Parking&quot; notices.</p>
<p>Next to the car, a lingering pile of trash: the overflow the garbagemen only sometimes deign to pick up. Our neighbors helped themselves to all but one of our city-issued bins a while ago. I've called twice for replacements, but other than reference numbers I haven't received anything in return.</p>
<p>God dammit, DC. This is all a bit much for a Monday morning.</p>

<p>I like how some of the shots of &quot;off-air&quot; talent are screencaps from on-air appearances. And how some of the contestants don't actually work in media at all. But the exclusion of certain perennial candidates is, of course, an outrage.</p>

<div class="line">Five years as a rugby player triggered my interest in world travel.</div>

<p>So cosmopolitan! Edgy, too — I <a class="reference external" href="http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/display.php?id=2008">hear</a> Adams Morgan is kind of a rough neighborhood.</p>
<p>With the Warehouse in trouble, this neighborhood actually does need some general-purpose space for art, music and events. But &quot;International Lifestyles&quot; aren't going to attract their allegedly-desired artistic class by setting up a guest list and throwing on a Thievery Corporation mix CD. Here's hoping this carriage house quickly reverts to something half as useful as the car repair shop it used to be.</p>

                    <p>Philadelphia's alt-weeklies are awash in she-males.</p>
<p>You only need to open up the Weekly or City Paper classifieds to find them. You might not see them at first, but they're right in front of your nose: it's just that there are so many of them that you might not notice. In fact, the default setting for prostitutes in these pages is ambidrogenous. Ladies of the night offering boring ol' hetero sex are compelled to add &quot;100% Female!&quot; to their ads so that customers know what they're getting.</p>
<p>Of course there's nothing wrong with this sort of thing, aside from the basic illegality of prostitution. Your sex life is your own business in a properly enlightened, liberal society. Still, it seems as though the market's interest in these strangely half-gendered individuals hints at a deeply repressed or conflicted sexuality that must be fairly widespread.</p>
<p>Besides which, it seems clear that the services on offer are particularly filthy. Most of the ads include a line saying there are &quot;X reasons you should call me&quot;, where X is a number ranging from around 7 to well over a dozen. Presumably this refers to the menu of sexual acts on offer. But my laughably naive schoolboy mind struggles to fill it out with monetizable sex acts. I can only complete the list by including services that are either deeply unwise or thoroughly implausible.</p>
<p>All in all, it paints a seedy picture of the city — one that must be embarrassing to its residents.</p>
<p>Still, it <a class="reference external" href="http://dceiver.blogspot.com/2007/05/at-last-city-paper-goes-crazy-on-murray.html">could be worse</a>.</p>

I was getting ready to do this with <a class="reference external" href="http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/schani/metapixel/">metapixel</a> and a custom script, but today (via <a class="reference external" href="http://www.tuaw.com">TUAW</a>) I stumbled over the horribly-named <a class="reference external" href="http://homepage.mac.com/knarf/MacOSaiX/">MacOSaiX</a>, which did exactly what I wanted. Neat.</div>
</div>
<p>All of this is occasioned by my Q+!U DC flag t-shirt getting worn-out enough to cross over into the &quot;gymwear&quot; category. Well, that and this video:</p>
<p><center><object width="425" height="350"><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/DJ5OBhlJEhQ" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="350"></embed></object></center></p><p>A new flag-themed t-shirt is in order, and doing something with Spreadshirt seems like a good idea. So I whipped up a couple of illustrator files — if you want them, here you go. I've certainly found myself wanting a high-quality vector version of the flag before. But then, I may have to come up with more graphics for DCist than the average internet user...</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="/static/2007/04/30/dc_flag.ai">DC Flag (accurate)</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="/static/2007/04/30/dc_flag_narrow.ai">DC Flag (squashed into a snazzier configuration)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I was thinking of redoing the flag in ASCII but, like my <a class="reference external" href="/2007/01/17/asciimation/">last project</a> along these lines, the early returns are a little underwhelming:</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/478976909/"><img alt="DC Flag in ASCII" class="center" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/184/478976909_f79adae5fd.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: 338px;" /></a></p>
<p>On the other hand, this music video makes me think that the idea is sound — it's just my execution that's off. Check it out, the ASCII starts about halfway through and is pretty neat.</p>

Or affirmative action.</p>
<p>But no! The place was chock full of earnest vegetarians, vegans and perhaps even a few <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breatharianism">Breatharians</a>. The bar only stocked a dozen or so bottles of liquor, but they were all plenty fancy. And the sadly lacking beer selection didn't stop me from becoming adequately intoxicated.</p>
<p>Anyway, I was caught off guard. During their lengthy battle with Shiloh I had assumed that the business was somehow paying its rent with dividends earned on a well-justified sense of indignation. But I guess there are actually lot of people out there who don't like eating meat. Well, good for them. But do me a favor and demand a few more types of beer to go with your not-meat.</p>

                    <p>Potbelly, 2:30ish. I'm standing in line, having just ordered a delicious turkey-on-wheat, when I spotted an older gentleman in line behind me. He was wearing a pinstripe suit, a blue shirt with a white collar, and a yellow tie. His gray hair was gelled into a short, relatively tasteful euromullet. And he was carrying <em>not only</em> a copy of &quot;Who's Who In Real Estate&quot; — surely one of the most vacuous possible incarnations of a shamelessly vacuous line of scam-books — but also what I can only call a scepter. I guess it could've served as a cane, but the black shaft looked a little insubstantial. And the brass head was spherical in a distinctly uncanelike way. Also, he wasn't using it to walk — it was just tucked into the crook of his arm along with the book.</p>
<p>I don't really know what else to say about him. Have you ever seen somebody and instantly known that they were the X-iest example of X that you've ever seen, but still been unable to solve for X? I don't know what sort of world he'd just come from, but I've got a feeling I should be grateful that it only intersects with my own in sandwich shops.</p>

It was only two blocks from my house, but I only went there once, for an incredibly awesome Halloween party in 2005. I didn't really know anyone there beside the folks I came with, and there were beer-related difficulties — we didn't stick around very long. But it was still extremely cool, and one of the most un-DC parties I've ever been to in this town.</p>
<p>I was definitely an outsider there, but I was still really glad to know that a scene like it existed. Hopefully it's being recreated somewhere else even as I write this — judging by the City Paper article I'd say it probably is. It seems unlikely that the folks running Fight Club would spontaneously disassemble their social hub unless they had another option available.</p>
<p>At any rate, the photos and video I took that night are below.</p>

                    <p>I was at Cafe Cozy Corner yesterday morning, which is part of a Brigadoon-like complex of businesses that seems to have erupted at 10th and L over the weekend. Most notable among them is an almost completely deserted CVS — I'm pretty excited at the prospect of having a drug store a mere four blocks from my house. It's true that it won't stock anything that Giant doesn't, but it's also true that checking out at Giant always involves at least twenty minutes of standing in line.</p>
<p>But the coffeeshop isn't as impressive as the CVS. It does have a lot of fantastically weird packaged foods — Pokky, dried tofu, and triangular rye crackers, among other things — but the clientele seems to consist of hungover not-actually-blonde girls in sweatpants and their lunkhead boyfriends (actual overheard conversation topic: Facebook). And, although Yglesias maintains that my goy status disqualifies me from opining on bagels, these chewy abominations were even worse than the watery coffee that accompanied them. Topping things off, the only wifi to be had was an incredibly slow link stolen from a nearby apartment.</p>
<p>So: CVS thumbs up, coffee shop thumbs down. But the latter's problems aren't anything that a new chef, a wifi link, and a serious botulism outbreak couldn't fix.</p>

                    <p>The Post's <a class="reference external" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/17/AR2007031700699.html">article on H Street</a> is getting blogged-up all over the place today. Aside from the ridiculous ending (&quot;OHHHHHH it's <em>SYMBOLIC</em>&quot;), it's pretty good. The opening struck an especially familiar note:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">A white woman and a little white girl are walking west on H Street Northeast, the 1300 block. Behind them, three black men are walking, not far behind, but close enough to invade their space, as if there is such a thing as personal space on a public sidewalk in the middle of a sunny Saturday afternoon.</div>
<div class="line">Three invisible men, residents who lived in the meantime, the in-between years when this street was desolate, neglected by the city, when some white people would not be caught walking in this block of H Street.</div>
<div class="line">One black man shouts: &quot;Ma'am, please tell your daughter she don't have to be afraid of us!&quot; The white woman turns and smiles. It is not a nervous smile. But she does not slow her pace; this does not appear to be done out of fear but is more a pace one might keep while running errands on a busy afternoon. The little girl holds the woman's right hand.</div>
<div class="line">The men continue, as if to prove something. &quot;Ma'am,&quot; one of them says again, &quot;please tell your daughter she don't have to be afraid on H Street.&quot;</div>
<div class="line">The woman climbs into an SUV and drives away.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>I used to run into this sort of Affability Test all the time. Now that my neighborhood's a little more gentrified and I'm a little older and (hopefully) a little less bewildered-looking, it doesn't occur as much. But it still happens from time to time, and it's usually discomforting or depressing.</p>
<p>The best of these types of interactions are like the one quoted above: they're just overwhelmingly sad and plaintive. The speakers are daring you to disappoint them by failing to engage and acknowledge them. I do my best to defy that expectation with a cheerful response. But that's just self-flattery — it'd be a stretch to think that those guys don't have a good reason for their yuppie-equals-jerk heuristic. And, to be honest, I'm not usually thrilled about having to stop what I'm doing in order to cheer up and/or prove my worth to a stranger. Maybe that makes me an asshole.</p>
<p>And if it doesn't, then surely the way in which I respond does. Am I being patronizing when I pick my words, or just recalling the high school truism that a constrained vocabulary turneth away wrath? Are the subtle colloquialisms I find myself unintentionally affecting as glaringly artificial to the person I'm speaking to as they are to me? Probably, although the person on the other end of the conversation is usually very kind about it. In fact, when I find myself speaking to folks in these situations they're almost always very nice.</p>
<p>When they're not, they're generally homeless people with mental problems or young guys trying to assert their dominance in front of their friends. In those cases it's tough to know what the right note is to strike between friendliness, assertiveness and submission. Is it going to give offense or spark further engagement if I make eye contact, or if I fail to? In the case of the homeless, once I'm acknowledged as being okay how can I continue to be polite without getting sucked into a five-minute-long spiel about bus tickets that ends with me lying that I don't have any cash on me?</p>
<p>Maybe I'm just a less friendly guy than I like to think, but there's a definite edge to these interactions. I don't think I can be blamed for not wanting to be scrutinized by strangers. I haven't done anything wrong, although I know that the fact of many other people like me doing the same not-wrong things is, in aggregate, doing harm to the city's long-time, poorer residents. But what can I do about it? And what can they do, other than stop me on the street and demand answers without asking a question?</p>
<p>I don't mean to sit here and complain about being forced to interact with my fellow man. But I can't pretend to enjoy these little chats, either. Being confronted with a stranger's sadness and anger is uncomfortable, no matter how politely-expressed or justified it is.</p>

                    <p>On the way into work this morning I saw a large, gaily-decorated RV with nurses inside of it. It was, of course, a blood donation van — a bloodmobile. More specifically, it was the Children's Bloodmobile:</p>
<p><img alt="image1" class="center" src="/static/2007/02/13/20070213_bloodmobile.jpg" style="width: 250px; height: 212px;" /></p>
<p>I had always assumed that the &quot;Children's&quot; in the title stood for <a class="reference external" href="http://www.dcchildrens.com/">Children's Hospital</a>. But if that's the case, is it just coincidence that the bloodmobile was parked outside of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.sailpcs.org/">a K-12 charter school</a>?</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/389193999/"><img alt="photo of a children's bloodmobile parked directly outside of a charter school" class="center" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/148/389193999_a027008220.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Is that &quot;children's&quot; a proper noun or an adjective? It might be time to read up on how charter schools get their funding.</p>

<p>Today started off on an exciting note, with police sirens screeching and officers screaming at a couple of gentlemen about 150 feet from my bedroom window. &quot;Get down and put your hands up!&quot; seemed to be the core message, but the officers tried out a number of different variations (consistent delivery, though). My real camera's battery had run down, so this is the best picture I could manage; you'll have to take my word for the fact that it was kind of awesome (or at least loud).</p>

<li>They've <a class="reference external" href="http://adv.washingtonpost.com/blogroll/2006/11/about_blogroll_1.html">already launched</a> and will be continuing to build upon a hyperlocal AdWords competitor that only shows ads when it can beat the AdWords <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_Per_Mille">CPM</a>. The assembled bloggers seemed most interested in this, despite the fact that it'll likely mean a difference of a fraction of a cent per click. Nobody who was in that room is going to become rich off of this (although you'd never know it from the volume and pugnacity of the questions that it prompted). But it's interesting from the Post's perspective: it's a forward-thinking way of reclaiming ground from Craigslist. That's pretty smart.</li>
<li>More interestingly, they plan to launch a directory of DC blogs. Of course, <a class="reference external" href="http://dcblogs.com/">we've already got a good one</a>. But the Post seems certain to become the canonical index. It'll be good to have this stuff in one high-profile place, and even better to have it exposed to the Post's massive readership. On the whole, it seems certain to be a win for the DC blogosphere.</li>
</ul>
<p>But there are some downsides:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>They intend to rip off the already-much-ripped-off DCist Flickr pool idea. C'est la vie. But credit where due: I believe it was <a class="reference external" href="http://www.goodspeedupdate.com/">Rob</a>'s idea originally, and it was a great one. But they may get more than they're bargaining for: they're a family newspaper — I suspect spam and griefers will be a problem for something as high profile as this. I got the distinct impression that they don't have a full-time staffer available to run this thing.</li>
<li>They didn't seem very receptive to the idea of providing an API. I think that's a shame — directories of this kind ought to be open and accessible. I suppose I'll write some Perl to turn it into an OPML file every day and serve it up somewhere. Still, it would be nice if they embraced the spirit of openness. They'll be offering some RSS feeds, but I don't think that's enough.</li>
<li>Similarly, despite their goal of by-neighborhood categorization, they seemed nervous about precisely geocoding the participating blogs. <a class="reference external" href="http://nikolasrschiller.com/">Nikolas Schiller</a> kept pushing for it, and I joined him, but they claimed to be worried about the privacy implications — and eventually turned the word &quot;geocoding&quot; into a running joke, as if they didn't know what it meant. Now, I do think that Nikolas is a bit map-happy, but he's absolutely right about this. There are pretty simple ways to collect and use precise data without exposing it to dangerous weirdos.</li>
</ul>
<p>But I'm sure that privacy is only part of their concern. Finding someone to write the API and geocoding stuff is probably the bigger stumbling block. They seem like they're building a pretty basic Yahoo-style directory (right down to trying to settle on a fixed taxonomy for participating bloggers to use), and I imagine they don't want to complicate anything. But the API could consist of a handful of simple REST calls, and geocoding is just a Google Maps mashup away (it's a lot easier than it looks). The front page will just be a little fun, flashy stuff thrown on top of their crawled RSS database.</p>
<p>As for their motivation, I think it must primarily be out of the goodness of their hearts — and wanting to be the center of the DC blogosphere. Other than attracting participants to their ad program, I don't see how they're going to monetize it. So call it a good thing for the blogs of DC — but not as good a thing as it could be.</p>
<p>Oh! They're also going to begin geocoding their <a class="reference external" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/rss/index.html">RSS feeds</a> soon. That was probably the most exciting thing I heard all night.</p>

<p>It's a fascinating thesis. But what's the Marxist take on replica Rolexes as Christmas gifts?</p>
<p>I really, <em>really</em> don't understand why Indymedia exists. If they has some sort of editorial staff that cultivated, screened and ran leftist essays and reporting, that'd be one thing. But they seem to just take random crap from anybody and throw it up on the site — I recall one recent post from Indymedia DC accusing Google of having nothing to do with the internet (they're actually a narcotics cartel, see...) and another that consisted solely of a rambling apology to the author's AA sponsor. Hilariously, Wikipedia <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indymedia#Structure">cites</a> the DC chapter as one of the more regimented within the organization. I keep my RSS subscription because the local media doesn't bother to provide notice of upcoming protests, which, given warning, are frequently an avoidable inconvenience. But other than that, DC Indymedia seems hilariously useless.</p>
<p>I'm left to conclude that the only other function they serve is to lower the barriers that prevent dopes from publishing things on the internet. Which, if you haven't noticed, aren't particularly high to begin with. I can't believe that governments bother to seize these guys' servers.</p>

<div class="line">I'm a little worried, though — Rusty's resolve <a class="reference external" href="http://whyihatedc.blogspot.com/2006/10/late-night-shots-party-crash.html">seems to be faltering</a>.

<div class="line">Anyway, I'm sure that the LNS crowd has a full Wonkette crisis response initiated. I've no doubt that they're superficially peeved, but secretly deeply, deeply satisfied. First: people paying attention! The board's denizens must be glamorous and interesting after all. Second: the obvious response is to hatch secret conspiracies. This incursion by the outside world represents a chance to set up new, more exclusive inner circles, in a flurry of private-messaging between the idiot children of the American aristocracy. It's an opportunity to purge the undesirables from the LNS boards — and you've gotta love a good purge. Let a thousand electronic Skull and Bones bloom!</div>

<div class="line">I'm about to head off to vote, but before I do, one additional thought on the election — and this one has almost nothing to do with helicopters.</div>
<div class="line">This <a class="reference external" href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/010880.php">robocalling</a> <a class="reference external" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/06/AR2006110601103.html">business</a>? It's going to get much, much worse. Frankly, I'm a little bit surprised that the NRCC is so obviously to blame for these sleazy tactics. The technology necessary to make automated calls is now within the grasp of any hobbyist:</div>
</div>
<blockquote>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Download <a class="reference external" href="http://www.asterisk.org">Asterisk</a> (it's free). Installation is pretty simple by opensource standards, but if it's still too daunting, there are liveCDs <a class="reference external" href="http://www.voip-info.org/wiki-Asterisk+Bootable+CDROM">available</a>.</li>
<li>Set up an outbound account with a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.vitelity.net/">cheap bulk-termination provider</a> — this is what lets you turn internet traffic from your installation of Asterisk into actual phone calls on the public switched telephone network. Minimum buy-in for these services is usually around $15. Credit can be purchased with a VISA giftcard or, in many cases, with PayPal. I haven't tried buying this sort of thing anonymously, but, having gone through the process legitimately several times, I don't see what would stop you. Outbound calls cost around 1.3 cents/minute and turnaround on new accounts is usually instantaneous.</li>
<li>Get some phone numbers to call. I'm sure there are databases you can buy, but you could also just randomly generate numbers with the right area code.</li>
<li>Record a disenfranchising message. Maybe you warn that back taxes or delinquent parking tickets will be collected at the polling place. Or maybe you direct voters to a new, nonexistent polling place. It's not hard — it just takes a little bit of imagination and a computer with a microphone.</li>
<li>Write a dial plan that dials a number and plays your message. Write a script to autolaunch this dialplan over and over, working through your list of numbers. This takes a little bit of know-how, but is well within the reach of anyone who can get an A or a B in CS101. It'd take 20 lines of code, tops.</li>
<li>Run your nefarious scheme. Using a purloined wifi connection might be tricky — you generally have to open up ports on the router to let the VoIP traffic go through properly. But if you drive around looking for access points named &quot;linksys&quot; you'll probably be able to find a few with the <a class="reference external" href="http://defaultpassword.com">default administrative password</a> unchanged. Go in, open up the ports and you're all set — you can run your robodialer from a laptop plugged into your car's cigarette lighter.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">It's all pretty easy. And it's only going to get easier over the next two years.</div>
<div class="line">Now, consumer bandwidth isn't up to NRCC levels of malfeasance. But you should at least be able to make a few dozen phone calls simultaneously over a broadband connection. And since these calls don't have to be very long, you could easily chew through thousands of voters over the course of the time window when your tactic is likely to be both effective and immune to press coverage. Get a few wackos doing this and you might actually be able to affect turnout. For municipal elections it would probably be very easy to have an effect without getting caught.</div>
<div class="line">So am I worried about this? Maybe a little. But there's no going back, and the big boys are already misbehaving — I don't particularly mind if the process gets democratized. I suspect that it'll soon become common wisdom that you ought to ignore your phone during the week before an election. Sure, it'd be nice to see the FCC take action. But they're awfully busy with indecency complaints, broadcast flags and bungled cableCARD/HDTV transitions. I'm afraid we're going to have to muddle through this ourselves.</div>

                    <p>But hey! Wonkette! That <a class="reference external" href="http://www.wonkette.com/politics/matthew-yglesias/blogger-dresses-funny-ends-up-on-facebook-206947.php">photo</a> isn't yours to use — <a class="reference external" href="http://flickr.com/photos/sbma44/57221879/in/set-1239224/">it's mine</a>. Two things: first, my normally creative-commons-loving self didn't put a friendly license on the photo, precisely because my friends might not appreciate photos of themselves looking silly being republished. Second, even if I <em>had</em> put a CC license on it, you'd still be obligated to provide attribution. It's just being polite.</p>
<p>But I don't think they meant any harm. Judging by the permalink, Wonkette picked it up from somebody's Facebook profile after they'd already purloined it — probably somebody I know and wouldn't begrudge the use of the photo. It's all pretty understandable, I guess.</p>
<p>I haven't talked to Matt about it yet, but I imagine it's not actually a big deal for him, either — he's posted far sillier-looking photos of himself to his own site in the past. Still, I can't say I'm incredibly pleased about the situation. But maybe that's just because I'm sore about Wonkette <a class="reference external" href="http://www.wonkette.com/politics/dcist/cries-of-protest-fall-on-deaf-ears-207238.php">picking on Martin</a> (unjustifiably!).</p>

<div class="line">Sheesh. I honestly don't understand how a group of people can run through the city in dresses by day and party in lingerie by night — all of this while drunk — yet object to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.dcist.com/archives/2006/10/11/cross_dressing.php">a little publicity</a>. Nevertheless, I've spent a decent amount of time today figuring out diplomatic ways of assuring grown men that their bosses won't care if they occasionally wear skirts.</div>
<div class="line">When he's not busy defending freedom from democracy-hating Islamofascists my friend Scott has been known to participate in this weird hash/ing phenomenon (his has/hing name: Dick Snail, earned for reasons that are better left un-contemplated). He came up here for one of these Red Dress Runs, in fact, but left a little bit unsettled. He didn't really like the DC hashi/ng scene. I couldn't quite get him to articulate why — I sort of suspect the reason was that &quot;those people from DC are too much like people from DC&quot;. I guess that's pretty much right, although I still appreciated his sense of tact.</div>
