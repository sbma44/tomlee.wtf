                    <p>Josh Tauberer has written <a class="reference external" href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-actually-happened-civic-tech-joshua-tauberer-ibnbe/?trackingId=FfDEvpzVMapzu0%2FrmSGBmg%3D%3D">a great and generous post reflecting on the civic tech era</a> and why its successes deserve to be celebrated, even if it has been some time since its heyday. I agree with him. I'm proud of my time at the Sunlight Foundation and the part that Sunlight played in shaping the larger movement's legacy. And, like with the open data and open source movements that preceded it, I am frustrated when others suggest a movement has failed simply because it has lost its grip on the zeigeist.</p>
<p>Like other movements, civic tech failed to acknowledge the depth of the legacy that came before, and failed to achieve the triumphs that its most optimistic boosters promised. But this is normal, maybe even inevitable. The ideas, people, and expectations that the effort created have persisted and spread, creating changes that are lasting and positive.</p>
<p>Still, saying I'm not disappointed is not the same as explaining what happened. I got to be in the middle of a singular moment and try out some exciting ideas. It was an enormous privilege. In the process I learned a lot about a lot of things. This definitely included lessons about how wrong some of my ideas were. I think it's worth reflecting on these a bit. Not to catalogue my ignorance, but because the vagaries of nonprofit self-promotion and funding can make it difficult to share these sad or embarrassing lessons in the moment when they're won. I doubt I understood them then, anyway!</p>
<div class="section" id="sunlight-was-early-and-weird">
<h2>Sunlight was early and weird</h2>
<p>I should acknowledge this up front. Although many others had done seminal work on open government data--Carl Malamud and Josh spring to mind as immediate antecedents, but of course there are many, many others--Sunlight was an early attractor of the kinds of big dollars that can create an institutional presence. This was thanks to our co-founders: Mike Klein, for his deep generosity and vision, and Ellen Miller for her charismatic genius at fundraising. That early bankroll annoyed a lot of people, whose priorities could be counted on to differ subtly from ours. That antagonism was perfectly understandable, and not helped by my own competitive streak.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="money-works-differently-than-we-thought">
<h2>Money works differently than we thought</h2>
<p>Our peer orgs having different priorities was in part a reflection of Sunlight's idiosyncratic pedigree: Ellen did important early money-in-politics work at the Center for Responsive Politics, crystallizing a post-Watergate understanding of political mendacity and influence. From their sometimes subtle methodological decisions, CRP shaped how generations of journalists taught the public to understand politics. Sunlight's reporting division embraced this perspective and did good work within it. And Sunlight writ large licensed and redistributed CRP's data and perspective.</p>
<p>But I struggled with the sense that this perspective was incomplete. It was discordant, for me at least, to learn that an aggregation of corporate dollars--what CRP would label as Pfizer's giving to a senator, say--did not necessarily reflect an act of singular corporate will (corporations can't make such donations in the US), but rather the sum total of individual people employed by that company who had bothered to record their employer accurately in the course of giving money. That's still a source of influence, of course. But audiences were often left to imagine a quid pro quo that couldn't be really be substantiated. There is a difference between a bribe and a constituency, but the distinction was rarely discussed. And problems compounded as comparative analysis was layered on top: your conclusions begin to feel threadbare when you realize how often &quot;occupation&quot; is missing from an FEC record, or begin to ponder what &quot;retired&quot;--the most common occupation--should be taken to signify.</p>
<p>At the same time, parallel processes existed, like corporate PACs, which seem straightforwardly implausible if you read the FEC rules under which they supposedly operate and induce the company's officers to fund them. Yet we had limited insight into those processes, or how lobbying--an entirely separate universe--worked.</p>
<p>We had been set up to find more Duke Cunninghams. Meanwhile, political scientists, led by John Sides, had used a combination of affable charm and donated intellectual firepower to successfully infiltrate the curiosity-gap media, transforming decades of papers into a furious couple years' worth of Wonkblog articles. They--and the friends of mine who were publishing them--confidently assured me that money in politics was meaningless. I was led to mutter inanities like &quot;consumption good&quot; and &quot;reifies relationships&quot; in a way that I should have known was embarrassing.</p>
<p>We didn't even understand how the dollars got used, or why. Are TV ads effective? Is door-knocking? Should we be looking at campaign mailers? Campaign expense reports? Political science has made progress on many of these questions, but is still intermittently roiled by them.</p>
<p>I never doubted that money mattered, but I also couldn't explain precisely <em>how</em> it mattered. And as my working explanation was refined, it became less and less plausible that it would ever be embraced by my colleagues, much less that it could be conveyed to the public in a satisfactory way.</p>
<p>This dissonance persisted through my entire time at Sunlight. I made hires to address it--some brilliant political scientists (recommended by Prof. Sides!) who even today teach me fascinating things from a distance and who, in the moment, led my team through a years-long cram session of opinionated but no less informative polisci literature. With their help, our team began to develop a more sophisticated and expansive understanding of political influence: one that included lobbying, rulemaking, and media.</p>
<p>The projects that flowed from this explored new territory: natural language processing of the Congressional Record; similarity analysis of regulations.gov dockets (this one seems to have helped me attract my wife). The list of Sunlight projects I am proud of is much, much longer than this, but most of them should be understood solely as reflections of the brilliance of my colleagues--my role was finding money and institutional support for them. The form the projects in these newer areas took was also always a reflection of my colleagues' brilliance, but I do take pride in having pointed them toward some greenfields. Political scientists started using our work to power their papers, instead of just the other way around. It felt good.</p>
<p>I think we got dramatically smarter, and I still believe you must understand a system before your efforts to improve it have much of a shot at succeeding. But the nuance we gleaned rarely made interventions more obvious. We continued to describe, educate, entertain, all while also trying not to wear out our welcome with readers, funders, and reporters who were looking for &quot;punchy&quot; and had to be talked into settling for &quot;smart&quot;. I remain grateful for Ellen and Mike's tremendous patience with this pursuit.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="transparency-works-differently-than-we-thought-too">
<h2>Transparency works differently than we thought, too</h2>
<p>Money in politics was just one side of the house, though. It was what Mike cared about. But our institutional funders were enthused for a fresher and less confrontational line of work: open government. Digital technology lends itself to openness--information wants to be free!--so this was an almost inevitable side-effect as we applied the new tools of the Web 2.0 era to old problems of disclosure. Sunlight hooked that piece of Tim O'Reilly marketing genius to our founders' interests in a clever way: openness would be in service of transparency. And transparency, according to our original formulation, would make government accountable and trusted. This is how you convince your boss, who wants to throw crooked pols in jail, that inveighing against the PDF file format is part of the same mission.</p>
<p>We kept the &quot;accountable&quot; part in the versions of the slogan that followed, but at some point anything incorporating &quot;trust&quot; had to be dropped. It became impossible to deny that transparency does not breed trust. It breeds questions. A skeptical audience will not be satisfied by the threads of information you hand them; they will grip them firmly and yank, and demand more when they don't find what they expected under the skein they've just ruined. They have been trained by our media environment to know that if they dig deep enough, they will unearth something rotten.</p>
<p>The public's insatiability doesn't make it okay to keep them in the dark. But, just as the YIMBY movement has had to grimly acknowledge that additional civic deliberation can become counterproductive, so too did I eventually admit to myself that transparency might need some kind of limiting principle.</p>
<p>To the extent that I conveyed this idea publicly, it was probably a mistake. I didn't take seriously enough the responsibilities that come with representing an organization: you are not being paid for nuance and candor, you are being paid to omit it! I didn't know how to do it well enough. I don't think I ever managed to talk my brilliant colleagues in our policy shop out of calling for cameras in the Supreme Court, though. So I doubt my misgivings did too much institutional damage.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="digital-democracy-works-differently-than-we-hoped">
<h2>Digital democracy works differently than we hoped</h2>
<p>The tools we were using could make information available to more people, and by doing so they could make participation feasible for people for whom it was currently impractical. We thought this was true, and I think we were right. Pursuing it as an end was axiomatically desirable for democracy and also practically aligned with our cohort's 20-to-30something lefty politics, in approximately the same ways that Rock the Vote was.</p>
<p>But how would this work in practice? Our model was cerebral. Citizens on the margin of participation would be newly empowered to read the online version of a bill, or infographics about a legislator's fundraising base, or a pleasantly formatted list of their earmark requests, and then make more educated decisions about how to express their wishes to their representatives and, eventually, cast their vote. We put endless reference material online. We wrung our hands over whether it needed an SMS interface to bridge the Digital Divide.</p>
<p>I still wish that internet-enabled political activation worked that way. Today, we know that the way to activate the marginally engaged voter is to make them mad and collect their information and/or money. Eventually, this powers ads and GOTV somewhere where it will matter for electing someone who, hopefully, wishes to advance the person's interests (though who can say whether the person would agree). It's done at massive and relentless scale.</p>
<p>I wish it were possible to make a web page so good that it inspired every harried single mom, demented retiree, resentful high school dropout, and disaffected teenager to enter a digital Athenian agora and take up their duty to participate in measured and productive debate with their fellow citizens. Alas!</p>
<p>In my defense, at the time lots of people thought the internet was going to work out in a different and better way. And we weren't <em>that</em> naive: we knew our tools didn't have universal appeal and designed them, in large part, for journalists, who we assumed would continue to exist. (Okay, maybe a little naive.)</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="we-had-to-learn-what-had-come-before">
<h2>We had to learn what had come before</h2>
<p>I mean, maybe we didn't have to. Eventually we did, though. &quot;Good government&quot; had a long history, and if we were young and brash we were at least also easily embarrassed. Long-suffering civil servants teetering on the brink of retirement were no doubt miffed when we spruced up the CSVs they'd struggled to bring online in past decades, cheerfully described their hard work as trash, and patted ourselves on the back for sticking it in a REST API. But they were also selfless enough to be glad the work was being used, and we tried to venerate their efforts appropriately whenever we came to understand them. Ultimately, many of our team members decided to follow in those civil servants' footsteps, which seems like about the best apology one could offer.</p>
<p>We learned why COBOL shouldn't be a punchline, excavated the interagency turf wars and obscure court rulings that shaped the gnarled data systems we sought. We started out dumb and cocky, but we learned, and I'm proud of us for it.</p>
<p>All this has come back to mind as I've watched the DOGE rampage. The same callow confidence that the problems are simple, your predecessors were pathetic, and your youthful brilliance is all that is (so desperately) needed. But vastly more recklessness, more callousness, more destruction. You can't expect young arrivistes not to be annoying and naive, but you can insist that they embrace humility, eventually, and that they accept the necessity of learning. Mostly, I think we did. But until we did, we often probably looked a bit silly.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="cui-bono">
<h2>Cui Bono</h2>
<p>Democratization was an ideal baked into all the work we did at Sunlight. A vision of massively expanded participation. But what would this mean? I'm embarrassed to admit to being surprised when it became clear that the most enthusiastic users of our Open States team's magisterial database of state legislative information were state-level lobbyists. Of course they would be!</p>
<p>I realized that I needed a more economically-minded theory of what we were doing. Engaging with government had costs, and we had shifted them. Perhaps that would admit more people at the margin--some NGOs, some retirees. A good outcome, something we had always said we wanted. But it would not exclude or make irrelevant the old guard. It might even save them money. And it would probably not lift up the voice of someone who was outside the system because of their lack of education, or time, or interest.</p>
<p>Beyond that, I began to lose some faith in the virtues of the plebiscite. Processing thousands of regulatory comments will do that! These came from people with a democratic right to be heard, sure. Many were excellent and productive. But when they arrived in mass--and attracted headlines--they were reliably from people who were uninformed and obviously being manipulated by self-interested organizations. And not even as an act of political organizing! Regulatory dockets are not ballots, and by law it is the substance, not the quantity, of the comments that counts. These advocacy organizations were funneling users into spamming dockets with carbon-copied comments as a cynical exercise in building their fundraising lists, whipping the public into a frenzy and giving them something pointless to do, keeping them ignorant of the fact that the meaningful part of their response to this call to action concluded the moment they coughed up their email address. That we found some of these organizations and causes personally sympathetic did not make this dynamic feel any less gross.</p>
<p>It's easy to recoil from this kind of thing and find ones' self in an unpleasantly patronizing or at least technocratic camp. I could feel myself doing it, and did my best to reject the tendency. &quot;Democracy is the worst system we've tried except all the others&quot;--that sort of thing. But a rejection of paternalism is a principle, not a strategy. You need something more specific when you spend your workdays shifting the old equilibrium in ways that you hope will be productive. I can't tell you what a relief it was to join a startup and find that all of this reflection could be replaced with a glance at a graph of monthly active users.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="politics-became-entertainment">
<h2>politics became entertainment</h2>
<p>Our work was designed to be engaging and attention-grabbing, and thanks to our comms team we were often pretty good at fulfilling that aim. But this unfolded during the rise of a new kind of political entertainment and cynical performative partisanship, typified by the Daily Show and its offspring and then by the narcissism of Twitter. Eitan Hersh aptly named it &quot;<a class="reference external" href="https://www.eitanhersh.com/uploads/7/9/7/5/7975685/hersh_theory_of_hobbyism_v2.0.pdf">political hobbyism</a>&quot;. This made some of the most fun things we did at Sunlight--notably including Breyten Ernsting's brilliant Politwoops project, which we had adopted at his request--steadily more worrisome. For me it became a question not just of impact, but identity.</p>
<p>I was born just outside of DC. My grandparents were foreign service officers. I grew up watching <em>The McLaughlin Grou</em>p and <em>Inside Washington</em> (&quot;daddy's boring shows&quot; may have been my most successful coinage prior to <em>Docket Wrench</em>). Policy, politics--this is the stuff my whole family would discuss at every gathering. On holidays, it was as reliably in the air as the smell of roast lamb and cream sherry.</p>
<p>I came back to DC after college and found myself drawn toward new friends who worked in political journalism, who obsessed about these topics endlessly and at a level of insight and insider knowledge I'd only dreamed of. I dated a brilliant political science student. I hired a different one.</p>
<p>It was with slowly dawning dismay that I realized my interest in politics might not be a signifier of sophistication. I wasn't special, just early (the same goes for my teenage addiction to BBSes). After countless redistillations and refinements in social media's fractionating column, it became undeniable that vanity, tribalism, and self-flattery were significant parts of why people found politics--and our work about it--interesting. Again: this is not a repudiation. Many people pursue politics as an avocation for immensely important reasons.</p>
<p>But I grew unsure that I was ever going to be one of them. And I doubted the wisdom of ushering more people like myself into the hobby, even if I was not ready to give it up. People deserve to be well-represented by our political system. But I slowly concluded that this representation must focus on their needs and rights before considering their solicited opinions--and that the internet's increasingly flattened and cacophonous embodiment of the latter was at serious risk of imperiling the former.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="sunlight-was-never-really-civic-tech">
<h2>Sunlight was never really civic tech</h2>
<p>Practitioners of more traditionally competitive forms of political work had resolved these kinds of qualms long ago. But building for a specifically partisan vision would not have interested me, and even if we'd somehow been able to legally do it, we would not have been able to assemble and motivate the uniquely talented people that Sunlight did. We knew many peers who were pursuing that kind of work: friends working for campaigns and consultancies, using the same technologies and sometimes even our code. It was a constructive division of labor. But our work was more abstract, driven by principles and a dose of idealism rather than the charismatic personalities and causes that inspired our campaign-worker friends. And while I don't mean to repudiate any of those principles, I have to admit that they worked differently than I thought they might.</p>
<p>If you abandon politics to the partisans, what's left is governance. That's what civic tech would become. I don't think Sunlight was ever completely cut out for it: there was a fun, gossipy cynicism lurking beneath our bright-eyed techno optimism, and an institutional refusal to ever stop obsessing about money, influence, and corruption.</p>
<p>It also felt <em>dreary</em>. Mind you, we prided ourselves on wading into eye-glazing bureaucratic minutiae. Our work on inscrutable spending databases is the reason why I detected an CFDA-related scam from someone pretending to be my mother-in-law on instagram just last month!</p>
<p>But I'd been a government contractor. I knew that the people talking about procurement reform were right, but also that it would inevitably involve criticizing set-asides for sympathetic groups; directly antagonizing wealthy corporations; and, most of all, an inevitable dissonance between our organizational commitment to anticorruption and the reality that past decades of similarly inspired good-government advocacy were probably a big part of the reason the situation had gotten so fucked up.</p>
<p>I was glad to see other people, like Waldo Jaquith, pick up the procurement reform torch. And I was glad to see Code for America's incredible success at adopting the mantle of civic tech, because they were not only very good at it, but willing to embrace the unglamorous but important details of service delivery. I'll admit it: I was almost as jealous about that as I was about their hoodies--not least of all because I knew that they had placed themselves where funder interest was straying.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="from-civic-tech-to-eternity">
<h2>From civic tech to eternity</h2>
<p>Eventually, though, foundation officers' interest moved past even CfA. More could be said about that, but I will settle for expressing my gratitude for the generous support we received.</p>
<p>Enthusiasm for exposing political influence cooled. After <em>Citizens United</em>, the money in politics folks slowly admitted to themselves that they were no match for Mitch McConnell. The political scientists remained unable to find a statistical test that showed the things journalists knew to be true, but the matter was mooted once the journalists disappeared.</p>
<p>Jen Pahlka went on to government--and more recently, to life as a consequential public intellectual--and she was not the only one. 18f and USDS were full of Sunlight alums who had learned the same lessons I had and were ready to follow the movement's evolution into what may have always been its inevitable culmination: actually improving government.</p>
<p>They did. They are. And it should not be particularly surprising that you stopped hearing about their work. Doing things in government, while holding the incredible array of responsibilities that must come with the public's trust, is not glamorous. It's just hard and important.</p>
<p>I did not go with them. I left Sunlight after a five--six?--year run, and felt pretty good about it. I don't know enough about the period that followed to opine, but I was not shocked that Ellen proved irreplaceable, even as I was saddened by the consequences the organization's end had for many people I cared for and deeply respected.</p>
<p>We did our work in a rapidly changing world and, in retrospect, were a part of that process of transition, not a consequence of it. It can be hard to feel that kind of change in the moment. With so much to regret about the equilibrium the internet and society seem to have found, I can only hope the process is less complete than it seems.</p>
<p>But even though Sunlight's time has ended, I remain proud of how we rode the wave--at our best, with joy and curiosity and an eagerness to share. And I remain proud of the people and ideas it carried over the horizon and beyond easy sight.</p>
<p>Maybe this was a post more about me than about civic tech. Rereading Josh's post, I find I've restated much of it, just at much more tedious length! But I wanted to write it, because this time was important to me. I have tried very hard not to name any of the incredibly talented people that worked for and with me, because I am mortified by the idea of leaving anyone out. I hope they know how grateful I feel to have had the chance to count them as colleagues.</p>

                    <p>I just got this email from Scouting America. What a week for Pete Hegseth's Department of Defense.</p>
<div class="float wp-block-image size-large docutils container">
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="/static/2025/11/image.png"><img alt="image1" class="wp-image-3715" src="/static/2025/11/image-425x1024.png" /></a></div>
<p>Yesterday, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/24/us/politics/mark-kelly-pentagon-investigation.html">attacking a war hero astronaut senator for insisting on the rule of law</a>. Today, repudiating a youth organization with whom it's partnered for a century. It's genuinely disgraceful.</p>
<p>I'm an Eagle scout. I went to the Philmont and Sea Base high adventure camps, and Goshen every summer through high school. All three of my kids participate in our Cub Scout pack, where I co-lead two of the dens. Our youngest went camping before he could walk. Here are my daughters doing Scouting for Food earlier this month.</p>
<div class="float wp-block-image size-large docutils container">
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="/static/2025/11/image-1.png"><img alt="image2" class="wp-image-3716" src="/static/2025/11/image-1-1024x683.png" /></a></div>
<p>I got a lot out of scouting, thanks in no small part to Troop 647's exceptional adult leaders. I am thrilled to see what my kids are already getting from it and excited at the prospect it holds for them as they grow. It was and is very important to me. I doubt I can express what it meant that scouting began offering programming for girls in 2017, the same year I became a parent of one. No shade to the Girl Scouts! But the BSA--recently renamed Scouting America--is the program I know and love.</p>
<p>Scouting's transition toward gender inclusivity has been approached carefully and gradually. It's also totally voluntary: each pack and troop can decide what makes sense for them. But as of December 15 the coed troop option will be out of its pilot phase and an official, permanent part of Scouting America. I think single-sex troops will make sense for some scouts and communities, but our family is thrilled about what this change means for us, for scouting, and for the girls who will benefit. It works. My kids are cubs, but I've already seen it working at the troop level while attending a district Camporee.</p>
<p>But apparently Pete Hegseth's DoD is less enthused. The stated rationale for withdrawing support is that scouting has abandoned &quot;meritocracy&quot;. A word about that. I don't speak for Scouting America and don't mean to contradict its chairman's statement. But to me, scouting has never been a meritocracy. Meritocracy is about identifying and elevating the most talented, and leaving the rest to go find something else to do.</p>
<p>That is not what scouting is about. It can offer something to every child. What it does--why I am such a fervent believer in it, why I think it is distinct from other youth activities--is to untether effort and achievement from competition. It teaches young people that if you work at something, you will see results. You will get that badge, master that knot, finish the trek, persist through discomfort, survive in the wild, and learn to lead others.</p>
<p>Any scout can do any of these things. The scale of how they do it might vary wildly according to the kid. But every one, absolutely every scout, can come away a better human being for having made the effort.</p>
<p>The people in Pete Hegseth's DoD that made this decision seem not to understand this. Instead, they are dragging scouting into their imbecilic culture war, venerating sexism for its own sake.</p>
<p>I have no opinion on how many burpees our &quot;warfighters&quot; ought to be able to do. But I know that debate has nothing to do with scouting. I wonder what the people behind this decision think of <a class="reference external" href="https://www.scouting.org/resources/disabilities-awareness/">scouting's efforts to serve kids with disabilities</a>.</p>
<p>This decision will have consequences, particularly for kids in the Sea Scouts program, which is closely affiliated with the Coast Guard. I am pretty sad about what this will mean for the kids in DC's own <a class="reference external" href="https://seascoutsdc.org/">Ship 25</a>.</p>
<p>Scouting has had a long and fruitful association with the military--its structure is <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Baden-Powell,_1st_Baron_Baden-Powell">inspired by that tradition</a>, after all. But scouting will be fine. Ultimately, this is more of a loss for America's Department of Defense than anything else--a sign of the myopia and degradation of its leadership, and its inability to understand the true nature of the virtues that characterize our finest citizens--virtues that keener minds have understood since antiquity, that our military should seek out, and which scouting is designed to nurture in anyone.</p>
<p>It's another sad day in a pathetic era. But I am confident that the scouts I saw collecting food for the hungry last weekend will someday be part of making a better one.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>Surprisingly few papers use this title! I'm writing this post primarily to stake a claim before any more arrive.</p>
<p>But also because I want to register some hunches, which I had assumed were kind of obvious but which I increasingly suspect might not be. Scott Alexander is much smarter than me and knows a lot more about AI, but <a class="reference external" href="https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/p-zombies-would-report-qualia">this post</a> suggests to me that there's lots of profitable engagement to be had between the AI/rationalist community and theory of mind ideas. There's also the much dumber reaction to this week's <a class="reference external" href="https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/illusion-of-thinking">Apple LLM paper</a>, split between &quot;AGI imminent&quot; and &quot;fancy memorization&quot; without much imagination to populate possibilities in between.</p>
<p>Not, mind you, that I am some kind of oracle on these matters. Many years ago I took what I think was a pretty good course about it, but it was the sort of thing where a thoughtful professor leads a precocious class to his own mix of conclusions--not a comprehensive and combative intellectual quest. The pillars of that effort were Dan Dennett, whose work and style I really enjoyed but whose approach frustrated me--either he was eliding the hard problem or I was too dumb to understand his rhetorical deftness (likely the latter); and David Chalmers, whose work I recoiled from (supervenience?! philosophers absolutely love defining abstruse logical relationships that successors will fight over endlessly, and I was having none of it) but whose ideas I realize, years later, I have embraced more-or-less completely. These combined with what I knew of <a class="reference external" href="https://spot.colorado.edu/~tooley/Benjamin%20Libet.pdf">the work of Benjamin Libet</a>, which is usually understood in the context of arguments about free will but, for those of us who were talked out of free will several semesters earlier, applies equally well to consciousness. Since then I have occasionally tried to muster enthusiasm for the integral physicalist efforts from people like Penrose and Koch, but their attempts to find some secret redoubt for consciousness always strike me as ending rather pathetically.</p>
<p>That leaves me stuck on an account of consciousness--or really, phenomenal experience, qualia, the redness of red, etc--as epiphenomenal, a causal one-way street from some subset of the activity of the brain that is, I think, a less sophisticated approximation of Chalmers' ideas. Without a means of detection or limiting principle, this tempts me toward panpsychism, with an undersubstantiated hunch that there must be <em>some</em> threshold (connectome complexity?) that preserves our ability to keep phenomenology tied to biological systems, avoiding a hardcore dualism that would suggest the possibility of an immortal soul watching in disconnected horror as its brain-damaged body did other stuff. Conveniently, this also allows me to avoid becoming a vegan.</p>
<p>But which side of this guessed-at divide do LLMs and related systems sit upon? They are biologically-inspired and complex-enough. Do we want to hang our hat on backpropagation being too much of a cheat for them to feel anything? That seems like a stretch even to me (and I ate chicken this weekend).</p>
<p>It seems plausible that these systems have some kind of phenomenal experience. It's interesting to ponder what that might be like, the ways in which it might be alien from our own experience, and how much of a moral problem it might pose for GPU-owning humans.</p>
<p>There are some big differences. To start with, these systems don't have memory. Every new inference session restarts from the same set of weights. But their internal state evolves over the course of inference, in a way we could analogize to short term memory. Human brains change and remember, but not <em>that</em> fast--it's at least partially dependent on <a class="reference external" href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/jn.2002.87.6.2770">slow mechanisms that require protein synthesis</a> (in order to be sustained, at any rate). So I'm not sure their invariant nature meaningfully distinguishes their experience from that of humans. If hundreds of exact copies of you woke up staggered over time or space or both, and remained awake long enough to fumble for their phones and head toward the bathroom, then winked back out of existence, would it be a problem? I would be quite disappointed if my existence took that form, but I think I would be disappointed for reasons tied to my evolutionary drives, which might be inapplicable here. I'm not sure any of those selves would be suffering.</p>
<p>Specific properties of AI systems might make the brevity of the experience less objectionable, too. Maybe we are snuffing out a being every time we close a websocket. But not irrevocably, and not with any suffering. But human brains stop and restart conscious activity every night, and no one is bothered by this unless they start thinking about it. The LLMs don't decay. We could pick up where we left off any time. To suggest an ethical obligation to maximize their experience leads us to Parfit's repugnant conclusion and the ideas of certain popes, so I'll avoid it. But that's the basis upon which I can see a problem with hitting &quot;pause&quot;.</p>
<p>No, I think the most troubling aspect of this setup is how fully we, the operators, control the mental states giving rise to this hypothetical phenomenology. We're loading the dice of deterministic mental processing in service of our own goals, waking a feeling <em>thing</em> from oblivion to experience what it feels like to debug a Python script, then be instantly annihilated. This feels pretty bad, intuitively, based on stories we have about mind control, insanity, and enslavement.</p>
<p>But of course we aren't fully in control of our mental states either--or even at all, depending on what is intended by &quot;we&quot;. And it's unclear whether reading by insufficiently-idiomatic Python can truly be said to rise to the level of suffering (you'd have to ask someone who has reviewed my pull requests). I am sure there are people on Bluesky who will tell you that burning carbon (and worse, infringing copyright!) to synthesize the sensation of working a white collar job is particularly insidious, but I'm not sure. We start these things' system prompts by telling them they are helpful assistants, and within the cultural gestalt that has shaped their weights it seems reasonable to guess that the sensations that accompany that activity aren't unpleasant.</p>
<p>But I don't mean any of these reservations to suggest that I don't think an LLM's phenomenal experience, if it exists, wouldn't be extremely weird, and worth worrying about. Our own experience is mediated by so many baroque biochemical and conceptual systems, evolved to satisfy environmental imperatives we only half-remember, that its underpinnings feel holistic and opaque. It's easy to drape a mysterian nobility on top of this. I imagine LLM thinking as more like a box of half-assembled Lego projects that is given a vigorous shake, its contents' configuration and constraints giving rise to new combinations that we make useful through some high-tech haruspicy. What does that tumult feel like before the shaking stops?</p>
<p>I certainly don't know, but I won't be shocked if it feels like <em>something</em>, and probably something that, by human standards, seems pretty weird. These are guesses, and might remain guesses forever--though the current AI moment's elucidation of <a class="reference external" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12540">potentially significant philosophical results</a> gives me some hope that things are more tractable than the p-zombie loop I've been stuck in would suggest.</p>
<p>What I am sure of: <a class="reference external" href="https://www.criticalopalescence.com/p/is-blake-lemoine-really-all-that">more and more people will be wondering about these matters soon</a>, and it will produce ethical debates that are dizzyingly alien and intractable. The frontier labs should probably hire some more philosophers while the money remains so easy.</p>

                    <p>I found myself chatting with some smart friends over the weekend. Like any good party, the conversation eventually turned to cryptocurrency. By the end, I was convinced I should write this post.</p>
<p>I am not and don't want to be a crypto guy. But I am convinced there is an important policy idea that is falling through an unusually tidy political economy vortex. Everyone who cares about cryptocurrency hates it--even the people who hate cryptocurrency! But this is unfortunate: it's a good idea. The people who hate it are being naive or self-serving in their opposition. So indulge me while I talk about why the U.S. government should issue a central bank digital currency (CBDC).</p>
<p>There's a lot of writing about CBDCs. For a while, I avoided composing this post because I didn't understand it. But I've now read enough to feel confident that this is one of those areas that defies comprehension because everyone is hiding the ball. I think most participants' reasons for engaging with this debate are much more venal than they are willing to fully acknowledge. This account may be wrong, but I hope that it is at least entertainingly ungenerous.</p>
<div class="section" id="what-s-a-cbdc">
<h2>What's a CBDC?</h2>
<p>A CBDC is a digital version of a currency. Crucially, it is issued by a government. Under most modern proposals, it is implemented as a cryptocurrency. Its closest analogue is the stablecoin, which is a class of cryptocurrencies that try to keep their value as close to that of a real-world currency as possible. Stablecoins don't have a government affiliation. They are private projects, without government backing, which achieve their stability by technical schemes like creating and destroying coins algorithmically, and by holding--or at least claiming to hold--reserves of the real currency.</p>
<p>Instruments like this are an extremely important form of financial lubrication. Cryptocurrency needs an interface to the real world. It must be exchangeable for things of value. It's easy to see why an ongoing exchange rate between Bitcoin and dollars makes sense. Situating that kind of transaction in the blockchain universe, rather than amongst bank APIs and tangles of wire transfers, gives them access to all the automation, smart contracts, and other affordances of the digital financial system. It helps to make the market for these assets liquid and efficient.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="stablecoins-not-that-stable">
<h2>Stablecoins: not that stable</h2>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.moodys.com/web/en/us/insights/data-stories/stablecoins-instability.html">Stablecoins sometimes &quot;depeg&quot;</a>: they lose their ability to maintain their 1:1 value correspondence. There's money to be made when this happens, which means people try to engineer it into happening.</p>
<p>CBDCs don't have this problem. Or at least ours wouldn't. The government can make dollars. Making dollars as a CBDC would be marginally more complicated than the way the Fed makes dollars, but it's perfectly doable.</p>
<p>Excepting governments that are true financial basketcases, CBDCs should always be able to offer stability advantages over corresponding stablecoins. The government's unique ability to mint currency gives it other advantages over stablecoins, too. If the U.S. had a CBDC and encouraged its adoption, use of USD stablecoins would decrease--dramatically so, I suspect. And if the government decided they wanted to ban such pseudo-dollar offerings outright, perhaps they could do that, too.</p>
<p>But I don't care about what happens to stablecoins very much. I want a CBDC because of crime.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="crypto-is-not-going-away-people-love-crime-too-much">
<h2>Crypto is not going away, people love crime too much</h2>
<p>Crypto skeptics love to say that the technology has no use case. They point at the underwhelming web3 projects, the silly digital asset schemes, the endless shitcoin rug pulls, and they smirk and say, &quot;The only thing people use it for is speculation and crime!&quot; Attention leads to legitimacy, which rewards the speculators. Instead, we should simply <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlKao_Pox5A">turn away</a>.</p>
<p>I think this underestimates the enduring popularity of the crime use case and just how well crypto serves it. It is lawless, except for mathematically-guaranteed property rights. That is an intensely compelling proposition for the powerful.</p>
<p>Normally, if you have money and do something the U.S.-led international order doesn't like, people who own very-large-font windbreakers will get a judge to sign something that lets them take your money from your bank. Or they will get an agency or Congress to tell all the banks that they will be in big trouble if they talk to you, or maybe even anyone a bit <em>like</em> you. If you respond by avoiding banks, turning your money into inconveniently bulky physical assets, the authorities will instead use their enormous international security apparatus to find and take it when you cross a border or stay in one place or try to buy anything interesting.</p>
<p>Sometimes this goes too far! I don't like reading about credit card companies ruining the livelihoods of honest pornographers. Civil asset forfeiture is bad, even if it did give us <em>Rebel Ridge</em>. Many people are very upset about the incredible power the U.S. wields in this domain, which is indeed underappreciated, sometimes extrajudicial, and genuinely gobsmacking. If you think it's bad, on the whole, I understand.</p>
<p>But I also disagree. I think this is a huge deal and that while there is need for accountability, justice, and reform, it's unwise to attempt to destroy this part of our law enforcement system in a fit of libertarian pique. I think it's pretty good that drug smugglers and rogue states and organized crime are subject to this kind of friction.</p>
<p>Those kinds of people <a class="reference external" href="https://www.wsj.com/world/asia/north-korea-cryptocurrency-580d7d3f">love cryptocurrency</a>, because it is genuinely immune to these effects. Remember when Jason Isaacs took that phone call in <em>White Lotus</em> Season 3 about his assets being frozen? Well, what if his assets were impossible to seize and could be transported, in full, on a slip of paper that fit in his wallet? I think he would have had a much more pleasant vacation.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="everyone-hates-this-idea">
<h2>Everyone hates this idea</h2>
<p>Moving the interface between US dollars and cryptocurrency into the Treasury building (or Fed) could extend our government's law enforcement capabilities further into the crypto sphere. People don't like this idea.</p>
<p>Crypto skeptics don't like it because they believe it would constitute a government endorsement of a system they consider to be corrupt and annoying, and which they have told themselves might eventually go away because it is so silly. But it's not going to go away. It's too good at crime for that.</p>
<p>Crypto enthusiasts don't like the idea because disrupting stablecoins would upset a bunch of specific incumbent financial arrangements, and because undercutting the crime use case would harm crypto's value more generally. But also because regulation is a genuine pain in the butt. There are a lot of people out there building dumb DAO projects who don't want to sell anyone ransomware or fentanyl or warheads, but who do care about going to jail for failing to comply with know-your-customer requirements that they don't understand and can't implement.</p>
<p>Banks don't like the idea because moving central banking closer to consumers often attracts proposals for public sector banking services under which the government could provide citizens with basic checking and savings account functions. This could simplify transfer payments, economic stimulus, transaction processing (maybe), and generally provide a cheap public option that competes with retail banking practices. American banks make tens of billions of dollars every year from <a class="reference external" href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/research-reports/data-spotlight-overdraft-nsf-revenue-in-2023-down-more-than-50-versus-pre-pandemic-levels-saving-consumers-over-6-billion-annually/#:~:text=and%20NSF%20fee%20revenue%20during,fourth%20quarter%20of%202023%20alone">account</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/paymentsystems/2021-Interchange-Fee.htm#:~:text=,Regulation%20II%20came%20into%20effect">transaction</a> fees, even apart from harder-to-gauge (but potentially much bigger) effects on their net interest margin. They would prefer to keep that business.</p>
<p>(Privacy advocates would hate this, too. But I don't think they've thought about it much yet.)</p>
<p>Finally, the Trump administration is using crypto for corruption to a <a class="reference external" href="https://www.axios.com/2025/05/06/trump-coin-democrats-crypto-stablecoin">strikingly original degree</a>. They have little interest in taking steps to improve enforcement in this sphere, since it would not only run contrary to their schemes for personal enrichment but also antagonize a wealthy bloc of their supporters.</p>
<p>So there's no constituency for this idea. Crypto haters fear government endorsement. Crypto lovers fear government control. Banks fear government competition. And, at the moment, the people running our government fear effective governance.</p>

<p>If our government wanted to, they could quickly become the most important way that value stored as cryptocurrency leaves the blockchain and becomes dollars. This could be done in a manner that reduces these systems' capacity for anonymity, tax evasion, money laundering, and immunity from lawful seizure. The old systems that enable criminals can't be stamped out, but they could be marginalized.</p>
<p>And they should be. Complicating commerce related to crime is really important. The ways that we do it have to be subject to democratic control. But right now this system is ascendant for very bad reasons. I don't hate crypto. But I do think it ought to be tamed.</p>

                    <p>The wordcel versus shape rotator debate was a brief but amusing moment of online faux antagonism. There is a natural human tendency to collapse all experience into a unidimensional continuum (or, if you're attempting to show an unusual amount of intellectual rigor, a four-quadrant chart), and this was a good one: a germ of an empirically observed neurological difference flowered into a blooming meadow of cliches. Masculine Nietzchean autists versus effeminate silvertongued jurists! Everyone could find a reflection of themselves and a satisfying new antagonism to complement it. Jocks versus nerds! Except only for nerds.</p>
<p>Discussing the spectrum that stretches from 3D packing problems to outright aphantasia also turns out to be a captivating way to interrogate differences in individuals' phenomenal experience--a tough thing to discuss in an anything-less-than-oblique way. The question was grounded in capabilities and deficits that were satisfyingly hard to question, and which could be felt even within a single person. If it lacked the calibrated pop of the black-versus-blue-dress meme, it was at least relatable enough to still be compelling. I certainly feel like I've experienced varying levels of shape-rotation over my life, or even over the course of each morning's coffee regimen.</p>
<p>The wordcel pole of the discussion remained underspecified. Maybe that was baked in from the start: a specific capability versus a referential pun. Each a perfect reflection of their camp, but still: what the fuck is a wordcel. It didn't matter. Most of the people indulging in discussions like this one felt like they sort of knew, and would self-identify as wordcels, and reductive introspection is only fun as far as it goes.</p>
<p>But I've been thinking about the missing parts of this framing more as I use LLMs to do work. Anyone who does will soon recoil from the idea that they are just &quot;fancy autocomplete.&quot; They can do so much more! And yet now, as returns to scale diminish and the allegedly-breakneck pace of innovation increasingly focuses on improvements in efficiency, intensity, or integrations, rather than gains in apples-to-apples frontier capability, it feels as though we can begin to more fruitfully consider what these things are.</p>
<p>I'm sort of coming back around to &quot;fancy autocomplete&quot;, but with the caveat that autocomplete turns out to be vastly more powerful than we ever gave it credit for. That a language, with its enforcement of logic and baked-in semantic relationships, can, if authentically implemented, constitute a processing function of much greater capability than most of us ever imagined.</p>
<p>It's as if I dumped the contents of a tent cinch sack in front of my daughter's Cub Scout den. As delightful as they are, I would not expect those kindergarteners to survive long in the wild (though we are working on this!). But if I told them they could take all the time they need but must use all of the pieces in the bag, and not break any, and put them all together into one thing that seems to make sense, they would be surprisingly likely to assemble a pretty good shelter thanks to the capabilities, limits, and functions that are inherent in those components thanks to countless iterations and unseen designers.</p>
<p>I used to think of language like a diagrammed sentence: a logical system with constraints, but not much more than an floppy skeleton of a thing. Fundamentally, a wrapper for some deeper realm of meaning. A computer system could emulate language with a Markov chain or something similar, but without connection to some underlying significance it would be a sterile exercise in embodying a complex system (and even an intellectually unsatisfying one, given the system's provable imperfections). <em>Text generation</em> could be thought of alongside <em>ray-tracing</em>: complicated ways of modeling the world that hold considerable technical interest, but which had obvious limitations preventing their use for accessing deeper insight.</p>
<p>This idea of language as an imperfect vessel for meaning fascinated me as a neurotic high school student. My inner monologue was ceaseless, and I blamed it for a lot of things I disliked about myself. Perhaps I was bad at soccer because I narrated my planned actions as the ball bounced my way. Perhaps I was bad at charming people because of the latency and artificiality introduced by composing conversational responses. I tried to suppress the tendency, seeking a more reflexive, direct, and uncalculated mode of reaction. Now, many years later, I realize I must have succeeded in this effort, through some combination of effort, biological decay, and mounting boredom with the sound of my own (inner) voice.</p>
<p>I regret pursuing that project, and all the more so if these guesses are right and what I was trying to abandon truly was as powerful as LLMs now suggest. Lots of people have pondered what humans would be without language, and my sense is that the most grandiose ideas about this (in the Sapir Whorf vein) are out of fashion. I am not qualified to say--I have to admit that my linguistics classes seemed the most impenetrable of all the philosophy I took.</p>
<p>But I do think the power and primacy of language is strangely missing from discussions of AI, which tend to be expressed in terms of reasoning and imagination, and chains of tokens, rather than assembling constructs within the rules of a system just a little beyond our understanding--a bag of tent parts that will often pop into the right shape.</p>
<p>I think we may come to understand these systems as embodiments of a capability we knew was important, but which we could never cleanly untangle from the rest of our minds. These things are not thinking beings, not beings or thought at all. They are pure language: a tool more powerful than we'd imagined, but (almost certainly) less capable than the singularists project. With their help, we will unlock the power of language systems in ways humans brains cannot--bigger context windows, faster speeds--and probably deliver at least some superhuman returns as a result. But I wonder if we will find insights of a dramatically new sort. Those might still have to come from whatever part of us is not devoted to wet, fancy autocomplete.</p>

                    <p>For many years I led the technical arm of the Sunlight Foundation, which was, at the time, one of D.C.'s most prominent advocates for government transparency. On the tech side of the house, the transparency mission mostly meant bringing already-open records into the digital age: getting public data out of PDFs and into CSVs and APIs. But we worked closely with colleagues who focused on more philosophical aspects of government transparency, from FOIA policy to putting cameras in the Supreme Court to how the PCLOB prioritized its work. We lived and breathed this stuff. <a class="reference external" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2013/07/31/ever-wondered-what-the-top-secret-fisa-court-looks-like-we-have-pictures/">One of our software developers took up the hobby of sketching the un-photographable door to the secret FISA court</a>! For fun!</p>
<p>I've spent a lot of time thinking about technology and government transparency. Enough, frankly, to lose some of my faith in it: I now think cameras in the court would be a disaster, and am convinced by arguments about <a class="reference external" href="https://www.wakeuptopolitics.com/p/march-1-2024">Secret Congress</a>. I am willing to go farther still! Although I now work in the private sector, I do so as part of legal team, and know all too well how annoying it is to opt for a phone call instead of a Slack message--just in case--when working with colleagues to figure out the truth of a foreign compliance requirement or patent troll's claim.</p>
<p>But the wave of anti-transparency hot takes I've seen in response to <a class="reference external" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/03/trump-administration-accidentally-texted-me-its-war-plans/682151/">the Trump administration's flatly dumbfounding leaks about an airstrike in Yemen</a> goes too far. This includes <a class="reference external" href="https://stratechery.com/2025/the-trump-administration-group-chat-signal-the-coke-of-secure-messaging-transparency-versus-security/">keen-sighted</a> <a class="reference external" href="https://x.com/deanwball/status/1904249766084546962">commentators</a> like Ben Thompson and Dean Ball whose perspectives I reliably find valuable. But they've got this one wrong.</p>
<p>Thompson opens by quoting his earlier but still-useful overview of the privacy differences between Signal, Whatsapp and iMessage, noting that Signal is top-tier. Ball is pithier:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Signal is secure and private. We should be fine with policymakers deliberating high-stakes, sensitive things using it.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://x.com/deanwball/status/1904249766084546962">https://x.com/deanwball/status/1904249766084546962</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having established that Signal is Secure, both then portray the offense committed as one against transparency: that this private chat was not subject to legally-required archival processes, and that keeping records from eventual public inspection in this way is the crux of objections to what these officials did--but that this is an objection that might reasonably be interrogated. &quot;[T]he violation was not about security, but rather transparency,&quot; says Thompson, going on to note that, &quot;It’s worth considering [...] if the push for transparency has gone too far.&quot; Ball, is, again, more emphatic: &quot;[C]andidly, America has far too much 'transparency.'&quot;</p>
<p>This is completely wrong. The problem here is security, not transparency. With apologies to future historians: I don't care whether discussions of their airstrike are (maybe) made public in <a class="reference external" href="https://www.justice.gov/archives/open/declassification/declassification-faq">twenty-five years</a>. I care about reckless operational practices that harm the America of today. <strong>Signal does not offer adequate security for this use case.</strong> Employing it in this manner was reckless and, at the very least, imperiled the tactical effectiveness of the U.S. military. If used in similar contexts--which <a class="reference external" href="https://juliansanchez.substack.com/p/but-their-texts">we should assume it is</a>--it could risk American lives.</p>
<p>In my decades consuming cybersecurity news, papers and presentations, I have noticed two things. First, nobody will give you a straight answer about anything without encouraging you to first contemplate your &quot;threat model&quot; (the chakra of the infosec world). Second, the most interesting news, from a geek's perspective, is confined to a world that often feels quite theoretical: <a class="reference external" href="https://cs-people.bu.edu/tromer/papers/handsoff-20140731.pdf">a paper about stealing encryption keys by touching a laptop</a> that only works in a lab; slick websites documenting arcane but powerful exploits that were patched before you ever heard about them. The real-world cases, where people actually get hurt, are much less interesting. Most victims are brought low by phishing or other forms of social engineering. Boring!</p>
<p>When Thompson and Ball say that Signal is secure, they are talking about the theoretical world. Signal's algorithms have been inspected by experts and deemed pristine. Great. In fairness, the kinds of people in <em>Houthi PC small group</em> <strong>are</strong> subject to threats from what cybersecurity people invariably call &quot;state actors&quot;: an acknowledgement of the fact that elite, algorithm-level weaknesses are so valuable and difficult to discover that only hacking groups with the discipline, resources, and needs of a nation-state find their cost/benefit attractive. If you merely hope to extort some Bitcoin, human weaknesses are much easier to find and harvest than technological ones. As a result, the world of elite exploits remains mostly invisible to us. We catch glimpses of it leaking out via the activities of <a class="reference external" href="https://www.techdirt.com/2024/07/01/stingray-briefly-goes-up-for-auction-before-ebay-yanks-the-listing/">American law enforcement</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://citizenlab.ca/2016/08/million-dollar-dissident-iphone-zero-day-nso-group-uae/">Middle Eastern tyrants</a>: two constituencies that are hapless, reckless, and well-financed enough to sometimes leak these precious secrets into plain view.</p>
<p>It's great that Signal is--as far as we can know--secure against these kinds of attacks. But: <em>what is your threat model?</em> Is it just this hi-tech, highly interesting, highly sophisticated class of exploit? Or must we also concern ourselves with the dreary practicalities of whether information could be stolen and used by an adversary? If the latter, then it might still be a problem that if a chat participant was using Signal Desktop--which we can't know or see, and which could easily be done on an unsecured personal laptop of unknown security posture--the conversation's security will be <a class="reference external" href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/signal-downplays-encryption-key-flaw-fixes-it-after-x-drama/">significantly weakened</a>. It might be a problem that (despite recent <a class="reference external" href="https://signal.org/blog/phone-number-privacy-usernames/">advances</a>) most people still use phone numbers for identity on Signal, don't know how or bother to use <a class="reference external" href="https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360007060632-What-is-a-safety-number-and-why-do-I-see-that-it-changed">safety numbers</a>, and are vulnerable to <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIM_swap_scam">SIM swaps</a>. It might be a problem that we don't know if the mobile devices used to run the app had biometrics enabled, adequate PINs, short lock screen timeouts, secure backups, strong cloud passwords, or protocols for lost devices. It might--sorry, no, it clearly <em>is</em> a problem that Signal made it possible to add Jeffrey Goldberg(!) to the chat without adequate confirmation or notification UI, or integration with clearance systems, or any capability for auditing by security professionals working in a support capacity.</p>
<p>(I'm not going to bother talking about SCIFs.)</p>
<p>Taken in isolation, this failure is an inexcusable lapse by people granted our country's deepest levels of trust. But even more concerning is the context it implies: that insecure systems are being used inexpertly in a widespread manner, and by an administration with a--let's be generous and say &quot;untested and iconoclastic&quot; perspective on whether the preceding eight decades' worth of conventional wisdom about America's allies and antagonists was completely wrong.</p>
<p>It is not enough to say &quot;well, human error is a shame, but I still think it's a really good app.&quot; It <em>is</em> a really good app! But the criteria for judging the scale of this fuckup is not whether the administration shares your excellent taste in algorithms. It's whether America's enemies knew or could have known the where, when, and what of our secret military operations. Good security protocols concern themselves with outcomes. And while human error may be ineradicable, following all those annoying rules really can serve to minimize our chances of succumbing to it.</p>
<p>Discussing secrets this way is reckless. And transparency has nothing to do with it.</p>

                    <p>I think, or maybe just hope, that <a class="reference external" href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/oKAFFvaouKKEhbBPm/a-bear-case-my-predictions-regarding-ai-progress">this account</a> is true: that LLMs will keep getting better, but that we know enough to understand what an LLM <em>is</em>, and make guesses about what an ideal one looks like, and that it doesn't imply serious threats to the primacy of human experience on this planet. Whew! This doesn't rule out a future AI godhead, but getting there will require more than just additional pitch decks and power lines. I hope this will give us all some breathing room and let my kids experience a last normal childhood, full of ordinary hopes and dreams.</p>
<p>It would also let us focus, for a moment, on the immediate risks posed by these technologies, my sense of which I commit here mostly so I can check in and see how wrong I am in a year or two:</p>
<p>I find Matt <a class="reference external" href="https://substack.com/app-link/post?publication_id=159185&amp;post_id=158644075&amp;utm_source=post-email-title&amp;utm_campaign=email-post-title&amp;isFreemail=false&amp;r=9s3&amp;token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoxMjY3NSwicG9zdF9pZCI6MTU4NjQ0MDc1LCJpYXQiOjE3NDE3NzM4NTQsImV4cCI6MTc0NDM2NTg1NCwiaXNzIjoicHViLTE1OTE4NSIsInN1YiI6InBvc3QtcmVhY3Rpb24ifQ.RtRip-2P3j-iJkptUdX8pWjEAgHZPZ5RFeaEqpnmOVQ">convincing</a> on <strong>worker displacement</strong>. But we will not do anything to prevent it--we'll talk about how the pie <em>could</em> be bigger, just like we did with China, but then find our half-hearted commitments to that ideal insufficient. Owners of AI-associated capital will become much wealthier. The D.C. area--faced with a need to quickly rebuild bureaucracies after the artificial shock of Project 2025--will be an early example of AI-pruned head counts, never returning to its former growth trend line. Matt expresses some ambivalence about which party will embrace AI protectionism but I think there's really no doubt on this score: it will be the Democrats, who've been incubating an anti-tech animus for over a decade and who are already writing anti-AI policies into Hollywood labor deals and other corners of the creative industries they dominate. Educational polarization means that the &quot;email job&quot; class most immediately exposed to AI displacement are disproportionately Dems, and their relatively high levels of social capital mean their voices will have outsize volume in political conversations. The party's going to be in the market for a new rallying point in the aftermath of the repudiation of the 2010s conception of social justice, and AI seems like a fine candidate: one that can plausibly unite economic and identitarian concerns (bias! inequality! surveillance!) while providing a narrative about culpability that points toward a small set of already-detested billionaires, and which implies policies that mostly look like a comfortable continuation of the status quo: antagonizing the ultra-wealthy and protecting coalition factions.</p>
<p>The bulk of this synthesis is already present in the 2024 Democratic Party Platform:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>President Biden issued a landmark Executive Order directing federal agencies to establish new high standards for AI safety and security, protect Americans’ privacy, advance equity and civil rights, stand up for workers and consumers, promote competitive markets for AI development and use, and more. Democrats are committed to ensuring that workers get a voice in how AI is used in their workplace and that they share fairly in any economic gains AI produces.</p>
<p>We know that AI can deepen discrimination, bias, and other abuses in justice, health care, education, and housing. That’s why the Administration has already taken action by publishing the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights and issuing new guidance from federal agencies on combating algorithmic discrimination across the economy.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://democrats.org/static/2024/09/2024_Democratic_Party_Platform_8a2cf8.pdf">https://democrats.org/static/2024/09/2024_Democratic_Party_Platform_8a2cf8.pdf</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Biden-era approach to AI has been trash-binned, but nevermind: a rebranded version will be back in a few years. None of this will be enough to stop displacement, and none of <em>that</em> will be particularly good for our society's stability. I'm confident that old lawyers will protect themselves and young people will figure out something new to do, but there's going to be a big cohort of downwardly-mobile Millennials and Gen Zers whose resulting political neuroses will harm us all. Hopefully I am too old to be one of them!</p>
<p><strong>CBRN threats</strong> are the only near term x-risk. I encourage everyone to read <a class="reference external" href="https://openai.com/index/openai-o1-system-card/">the relevant section of the o1 system card</a> for a sense of how frontier labs are tackling this issue. They're looking at it in sophisticated ways, which is encouraging, but the progress they note makes it appear quite likely that LLMs produced by less ethical teams will meaningfully accelerate malicious actors' capabilities in these fields. Open source LLM development will not be stopped. I don't see a way to halt associated CBRN development without significant changes to how scholarly work in some fields is published. Fortunately, the open access revolution remains incomplete and the replication crisis has added to the obviousness of the need for reform. Data availability in general will go down, as synthesis and analysis are commodified and participants in relevant industries retrench toward gating knowledge to preserve their incomes. This will mostly be quite sad, especially for an open data weirdo like myself (viz, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/4276-he-who-receives-an-idea-from-me-receives-instruction-himself">one of the very few tattoo candidates</a> I've ever considered). But perhaps it could save us from a super-plague. On the other hand, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/chinese-researchers-find-bat-virus-enters-human-cells-via-same-pathway-as-covid/article69249248.ece">we appear to have learned absolutely nothing from our most recent global bio-crisis</a>. We'll see, I guess!</p>
<p><strong>Ubiquitous surveillance</strong> is an obvious but largely ignored application of AI technology, perhaps because of its inevitability. Arguably, it's more &quot;recent term&quot; than &quot;near term&quot;: <a class="reference external" href="https://www.axios.com/2025/03/06/state-department-ai-revoke-foreign-student-visas-hamas">our government is already using AI in exactly this way</a>. In the digital-era U.S., a surprisingly large number of practical civil libertarian guardrails rely on the impracticality of bureaucrats writing SQL queries that work across the chasms of federalism. All that's going to end, and the new status quo will result in further-empowered law enforcement. Here, too, we will see that data availability becomes the major check on unlimited analytic power: E2E encryption and the legislative fights surrounding it will be the most important point of contention. It's a silver lining that the era in which these policies are energetically revised will likely be one chastened by the recent excesses of a vindictive and childishly unprincipled Trump administration.</p>
<p>Finally, <strong>autonomous weapons</strong>--particularly drones--could become a real horror, given the precursor technology's proven efficacy in the Ukraine War and ongoing research to move beyond the fiber/UHF FPV technology of today and toward <a class="reference external" href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:pdgu3gsyjyfxo72ddh2sl7i5/post/3ljzqmubz7s2c">onboard reasoning</a>. DJI's monopoly leaves me mildly optimistic here: the supply chain is concentrated and systems optimized for low power/low weight inference aren't going to become common overnight. I'm hopeful that this will remain a technology mostly available to military actors, and that the basics of most murders--between acquaintances, driven by emotion--will mean that handguns' enduring popularity will not face serious challenge from unsanctioned forks of ArduPilot. Still, <a class="reference external" href="https://6abc.com/post/unitedhealthcare-ceo-killing-what-know-ghost-gun-allegedly-carried-luigi-mangione/15635179/#:~:text=They%20described%20the%20weapon%20as,silencer%20was%20also%203D%20printed.%22">3D printed ghost guns have captured some narcissistic psychopaths' imaginations</a>--an ideal project for deranged nerds who are too shy to acquire a normal firearm--and it's easy enough to imagine some harrowing episodes of assassination-by-robot. Building DIY UAVs systems isn't easy, but <a class="reference external" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/diydrones/">lots of people do it</a>. The explosive payload will be the only part you can't order from Amazon. Today's obstacles to autonomous/anonymous killing from the skies are software and processing power, and I would not bet against either remaining in place for long.</p>

<p>Read <a class="reference external" href="https://x.com/buccocapital/status/1891473002639868282?s=46">this thread</a> to see how it does with SEC filings. I haven't validated every number it cites, but it appears quite impressive.</p>
<p>The value of analysis is set to plummet. The value of authoritative data is going to rise.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, antipathy toward AI in general and its access to data in particular will skyrocket among the creative classes, then knowledge workers, then the rest of the Democratic coalition. Openness will be going into retreat.</p>
<p>This makes me sad. It's a very surprising reversal of technological progression's normal effects. But the seeds were already planted as platforms began to move beyond meeting their audience's whims and on toward molding them. You don't need an open web for that.</p>
<p>I still think that collecting value by gating knowledge is disreputable. And it's certainly not going to result in the value being distributed equitably. But, at the moment, we humans probably ought to cling to any economic redoubt we can muster.</p>

                    <p>Of course it was reasonable to focus on Mangione's interactions with the health care system as we searched for his motive. But now, with <a class="reference external" href="https://www.kenklippenstein.com/p/luigis-manifesto">his manifesto</a> in hand and some of his personal history known, those interactions seem bizarrely scant. He suffered from chronic back pain, but <a class="reference external" href="https://www.wmtw.com/article/luigi-mangione-unitedhealthcare-ceo-shooting/63157284">could still go rock climbing</a>. There's no indication he was denied care by a health insurance company. His family was prosperous and could presumably have found alternatives if he had been truly desperate. His manifesto ends with an abstract (and <a class="reference external" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9154274/">dumb</a>) complaint about U.S. life expectancy, not a specific tale of tragedy.</p>
<p>It strikes me as pretextual. <a class="reference external" href="https://www.kenklippenstein.com/p/luigis-manifesto">Jason Koebler says it's pointless to review a killer's digital history</a>, and maybe he's right. But to me the UHC shooter now seems very legible. I think the digital history <em>is</em> important.</p>
<p>Luigi is a smart guy, an Ivy League grad and high school salutatorian, a fact he highlights in his <a class="reference external" href="https://x.com/PepMangione/status/1600875886727016449">pinned tweet</a>. He likes podcasts and books that present grandiose ideas at a suspiciously rapid clip. He was not shy about making patronizing pronouncements about how others should live. He used his profile photo to show off his six-pack abs, a bodybuilding outcome that typically requires focused effort and techniques.</p>
<p>He was a beautiful, brilliant boy, who I am sure had been told, again and again, that he was destined for great things. He must have taken pride in that, worked to cultivate it the best way he knew how, and been eager to display his mastery to the world. This is narcissism, but it is a relatable narcissism, and maybe even an excusable one when performed by someone who is still young and beautiful.</p>
<p>I think Luigi's <a class="reference external" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/luigi-mangione/details/experience/">LinkedIn</a> is the true Rosetta Stone of his digital life. His time as a student bursts with enthusiasm: robotics! AI! An internship working on a famous videogame! Head of committee, founder, president, project lead. After graduation: four years at an internet company that sells cars. Data Engineer I, then Data Engineer II, then Data Engineer III. He delivered a 5% increase in net funnel engagement. A 34% increase in new vehicle payments. A/B tests, Java upgrades, metrics, dashboards. There is nothing wrong with this work and no reason to think it couldn't have led him to more interesting things, but these tasks are not glamorous.</p>
<p>As this reality unfolded, Luigi moved to paradise. He started a book club, a way to showcase the big thoughts in his big brain. He was amiable and well-liked, clever enough to conceal his growing sense of desperation. Eventually, someone would notice and point him toward the future he was promised.</p>
<p>That's how it seems to me, anyway, speaking in my capacity as a reformed beautiful, brilliant boy, who passed the tests put before him through talent and effort (but mostly talent), then was deposited in a disappointingly banal corner of American life and, for a while, despaired. Scholastic performance correlates with all kinds of things, but some people's ability to figure out what to do with themselves lands far from the regression line.</p>
<p>Luigi did not accept this, and if something hadn't gone so horribly awry, I would say that this instinct was admirable. He'd tried moving to a great place, and he'd tried saying great things, now it was time to perform a great act. He chose a path to glory that is perfectly consonant with the confused stew of privileged resentment that the internet's dark, moist corners excel at incubating. The manhunt must have been the best time of his life as he watched the world celebrate his heroism and beauty through the lit rectangle of his phone, alone and exultant on a softly jostling bus.</p>
<p>Soon we will run out of new ways to understand Luigi. The manifesto's account of his motivations feels confused and even self-disclaiming--he says he's not the right person to construct his argument for murder. That's left up to the reader (and to his credit, many are happy to do so). The manifesto instead focuses on explaining his boldness, his resoluteness, his cross-disciplinary mastery. These are instructions for how to admire him, the last ones he can be sure we will hear.</p>
<p>Yesterday, as he was dragged into the courthouse, he made a <a class="reference external" href="https://apnews.com/article/unitedhealthcare-ceo-shooting-suspect-c68d0328f278d85fcf201ae89f634098">desperate exclamation</a> to flatter his audience, to sustain its attention just a bit longer. But what he said made no sense. None of it ever made any sense.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>One of the reasons I've been slow to leave Twitter is my default skepticism about new services. I enjoy my ruts: I didn't want to leave ICQ, or AIM, or blogs, or the Instagram photo feed. I linger around these digital ghost towns even as my friends move on to more vibrant locales. That those friends sometimes abandon their new homes, years later, in disgust, is cold comfort. I should have followed them, enjoyed their company while I could, suppressed my misgivings about our new digital landlords. Instead, too often, I indulge my aversion to change and watch my RSS software's &quot;unread&quot; count tick upward ever more slowly.</p>
<p>Well, now my friends are moving to Bluesky, having finally reached apparent consensus on it rather than the unpleasantness of Mastodon or the temptation(?) to hand yet more cultural power to Mark Zuckerberg, for some unfathomable reason. <a class="reference external" href="https://bsky.app/profile/tjl.bsky.social">I am following them</a>! But I am bringing my opinions with me, to everyone's great sorrow. I can't help it. Bluesky is the best option, I agree, it's hard to deny. But I also can't deny my tendency to play Cassandra.</p>
<p>There is a lot to like over there. Forgotten acquaintances. Plausible (temporary) freedom from professional scrutiny. Silliness. A sense that you are in a place that is still manageably small, and which feels comfortingly real in its capacity to delight, or not: there are no perfectly-tuned systems to optimize engagement, no robot arm to shove you back into your cage at the ad impression factory farm. When you put your phone down it's not so far past bedtime, and you've been talking to people you sort of know, and your brain doesn't feel like it's been twisted dry for every drop of arousal and outrage.</p>
<p>It is also a little unbearable. Maybe it was hard to notice Twitter growing tepid, then cold. Stepping into Bluesky's freshly drawn bath is momentarily painful, I'm overcome with prickles. Everyone seems very sure of their opinions despite having just received a crushing repudiation from most of their countrymen. But humility does not drive engagement, not on old sites or new ones, and I'm not confident that my opinions are any better than theirs.</p>
<p>Except about Bluesky itself. Bluesky users are mostly very pleased with themselves for having left Twitter, consistently overestimate the novelty of the features they're enjoying, and are quite certain that Bluesky has a good plan to avoid Twitter's fate. I am at least sort of sorry to tell you: this is naive.</p>
<p>I think Bluesky does have a genuine opportunity to break the wheel of social media history. But good intentions will not be enough.</p>
<p>Let's run through the advocates' arguments.</p>
<div class="section" id="corporate-structure">
<h2><strong>Corporate Structure</strong></h2>
<p>Bluesky is a <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benefit_corporation">benefit corporation</a>--a different and more meaningful designation than <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_Corporation_(certification)">B Corp</a>. But not <em>that</em> meaningful. It comes with some reporting requirements and a mandate to consider social impact when making decisions. The supposed duty of normal corporations to maximize shareholder value is <a class="reference external" href="https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2015/04/16/what-are-corporations-obligations-to-shareholders/corporations-dont-have-to-maximize-profits">basically imaginary</a>, but it does seem that being a benefit corporation might insulate executives from some classes of legal action brought by shareholders.</p>
<p>But let's get real. Bluesky is not a public company. Barring some truly pyrotechnic malfeasance, shareholder lawsuits will not be a problem any time soon. The company has raised at least $15 million and has given the funder a seat on the board. If a board wants to get rid of an executive, they can find a pretext for doing so without announcing that it was due to insufficient levels of evil or anything else that might invite a lawsuit.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="jack-was-bad-jay-is-nice">
<h2><strong>Jack was bad, Jay is nice</strong></h2>
<p>I admit: the current board composition is notable and encouraging. Blockchain Capital, the money folks, have a seat. But they also gave one to <a class="reference external" href="https://knightcolumbia.org/content/protocols-not-platforms-a-technological-approach-to-free-speech">Mike Masnick</a> and the inventor of Jabber/XMPP. Mike is an ideologue (in a good way). And Jay Graber, the CEO, sits on the board, is reportedly the largest shareholder, and seems to say and believe the right things.</p>
<p>But you should expect the board to change. Twitter had at least five major fundraising events prior to its IPO, and these typically come with changes to a board's structure and, inevitably, dilution of its existing participants' influence.</p>
<p>More important, though, is to note the obvious fact that having good people running a company is no guarantee of its future path. I knew a couple of early Twitter employees. They were and are very nice, thoughtful folks. The tech press has taught us to detest him since, but once upon a time <a class="reference external" href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/10/21/two-hit-wonder">Jack Dorsey was the subject of fawning profiles in places like The New Yorker</a>. Media coverage of these figures is the only way most of us know them, and it turns them into heroes or monsters because those are compelling narratives. But the truth is that they're mostly just normal human beings who have borrowed millions of dollars.</p>
<p>You should remain open to the possibility that one day those normal people will need more money to sustain the enterprise they've fought hard to build, to preserve their friends' and subordinates' jobs, to pay for their kids' schools, to keep doing the good they believe themselves to be doing in the world. To manage this they will have to disappoint some of the strangers to whom they've been providing free stuff. But wouldn't those strangers be more disappointed if the whole enterprise just collapsed? Because that will be the alternative, as they see it. And what do they owe those strangers, anyway? The board members they've been working to charm for the last few years turned out to be perfectly nice people, but they have understandable obligations to their bosses and the people who subscribed to their fund. We never said we were running a charity!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="atproto">
<h2><strong>ATProto</strong></h2>
<p>When I raise this concern, people often point to the open foundation upon which Bluesky is built, and I agree that this is an important consideration. But I think very few people have bothered to read <a class="reference external" href="https://atproto.com/">the ATProto spec</a> and learn what it does--and, more importantly, what it does not do.</p>
<p>ATProto defines an approach to creating an interoperable streaming ecosystem of independent data stores, specifying how they should talk to each other, name things without coordination, authenticate participants, and perform related tasks.</p>
<p>ATProto is mostly agnostic about what data you put into it. Like an empty hard drive, it has complex systems of interfaces and protocols to define how it will store data. But the structures that give the data <em>meaning</em> exist elsewhere. Bluesky is one of them, defined by the <em>app.bsky</em> namespace/lexicon for things like feeds and posts, and by client applications to manifest those things in forms humans can use. <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/social-app?tab=readme-ov-file#are-you-a-developer-interested-in-building-on-atproto">Bluesky is open source</a>, and you can run your own copy. But Bluesky is in charge of the codebase and--most importantly--is in charge of <em>their</em> copy.</p>
<p>Listen to how they talk about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bluesky is an open social network built on the AT Protocol, a flexible technology that will never lock developers out of the ecosystems that they help build. With atproto, third-party integration can be as seamless as first-party through custom feeds, federated services, clients, and more.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/social-app?tab=readme-ov-file#are-you-a-developer-interested-in-building-on-atproto">https://github.com/bluesky-social/social-app?tab=readme-ov-file#are-you-a-developer-interested-in-building-on-atproto</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>ATProto will always be available to everyone. ATProto will never lock you out of what you build with it. You can put whatever you want into ATProto.</p>
<p>But ATProto makes no promise that Bluesky-the-app will accept what you want to put into it. Why would it? Nor are there guarantees that everything Bluesky-the-app does will always be put into ATProto for your delectation. It would be shocking to me if there weren't already caching layers, logging systems, and metrics tools on Bluesky's servers that exist beyond open public scrutiny. It's simply how you build a service for millions of users.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://cybercultural.com/p/twitter-in-2007-the-open-platform/">Twitter aspired to be, and initially was, quite open</a>. This was a manifestation of the beliefs and values of the smart, stylish technical people who worked there. At the time, APIs and third party integrations were very much in vogue among developers. We got excited about them. They weren't just badly-documented, locked-down plumbing like they are today. They were a dramatically novel way to integrate your work with the coalescing digital world. Even better, OAuth didn't yet exist.</p>
<p>Here's a sad truth: people spend money on things they need from you, which means things they can't get more easily elsewhere, which means things that are scarce. If you build an amazing, complex project in the open, and then start making money by charging people to use some part of it, it is very likely that other people will eventually notice and realize they can do the same thing using your work. And since you still have to invest in the work's continued development and maintenance, those new competitors can undercut you on price! Even more amazingly, if you express frustration about this, internet norms dictate that <em>you</em> are the bad guy (you should have known better before you started).</p>
<p>Here's another one: users may enjoy focusing on the minutiae of blocking and discovery tools, but what makes a social network truly valuable is <em>scale</em>. They call them network effects for a reason! To be the best, you need to be the biggest. To be the biggest, you need to be free. To be free, you will probably need to make your money with ads.</p>
<p>I know that Bluesky has announced plans to offer subscription features. I don't think this will work: there's always a tension between gating value and keeping barriers to entry low. Elon's selling an insane subscriber bundle, doing completely unethical things (priority for bluecheck reply-guys) and very expensive things (hour-long video uploads, access to a novel LLM model), and it doesn't seem like it's working. Lots of internet companies have experimented with subscriptions, or digital goods, or whatever else. They either become niche players or wind up back at ads, with all the associated privacy tensions, incentives for engagement-maxxing, and unquenchable thirst for scale.</p>
<p>ATProto doesn't include anything about advertising or even making money in general. Financial support for your implementation seems to be left as an exercise for the reader. But this is a very important detail. It's a shame that a project motivated by Twitter's failures didn't put sustainability and the pitfalls of the venture model front and center.</p>
<p>I think Bluesky should probably try to fundraise, like Wikipedia, even though they're not a nonprofit. I think they should change their terms to lock down a monopoly on monetized search. I think they should mandate support for ad inventory among third party clients.</p>
<p>Above all, they need to keep headcount down: minimize the number of mouths they have to feed. This will almost certainly mean some unpopular tradeoffs around moderation.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="reasons-for-optimism">
<h2><strong>Reasons for optimism</strong></h2>
<p>(<strong>and precedents no one wants to talk about</strong>)</p>
<p>Despite all this, I am not pessimistic. I am making this argument not to convince you that Bluesky is doomed to be bad, but to convince you to embrace the urgent and fragile possibility that it could remain good--but that this is far from guaranteed.</p>
<p>They have the wind at their back. The users are here. There's money in the bank. The board and CEO are aligned. The press is glowing. <em>This is the time to bind your future self</em>. Only real constraints, applied soon--ones so deeply structural that untangling them would be ruinous--can foreclose distasteful decisions against a set of future choices that, we must assume, will some day arrive.</p>
<p>Other people have done this. No one wants to hear it, but the web3/dApp blockchain people have thought about it a <em>lot</em>. I may be the only person who believes it, but fact that Jay and Bluesky's funders have connections to the crypto world could be a pretty good sign. Nostr, too, has tackled the issues that ATProto is designed for, and actually has multiple cooperating relays live today. But it's threadbare, it's associated with Jack, and the vibes are bad. Mastodon has a genuine federated ecosystem, but it's built and policed by people who learned social graces from Linus Torvalds, and its search will never work (on purpose, supposedly).</p>
<p>Bluesky's got the functionality, it's got the vibes, it's getting the users. It's got the opportunity.</p>
<p>Fifteen years ago, people thought Twitter was not just good, but figuratively and literally revolutionary. Hard to believe, I know, but it's true. <a class="reference external" href="https://prospect.org/article/cost-hashtag-revolution/">It made me uneasy</a>, and I'm sorry to say that I was eventually proven right.</p>
<p>I don't think things had to turn out the way they did. They don't have to turn out that way for Bluesky, either. But they easily could, and if you don't believe that, you're fooling yourself.</p>

                    <p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.openml.fyi/2024-10-10/">Luis Villa notes</a>, with some sadness, the closing of yet another door to the open web--occasioned, this time, by creators' reluctance to make their work available for training AI:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">[The open web] was inarguably the greatest repository of knowledge the world had ever seen. Among other reasons, this was in large part&nbsp;<em>because the combination of fair use and technical accessibility had rendered it searchable</em>. That accessibility enabled a lot of good things too—everything from&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="https://www.404media.co/project-analyzing-human-language-usage-shuts-down-because-generative-ai-has-polluted-the-data/?ref=openml.fyi">language frequency analysis</a>&nbsp;to the Wayback Machine, one of the great archives of human history.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">But in any case it’s clear that those labels, if they ever applied, very much merit the&nbsp;<em>past tense</em>. Search is broken; paywalls are rising; and our collective ability to learn from this is declining. It’s a little much to say that this paper is like satellite photos of the Amazon burning... but it really does feel like a norm, and a resource, are being destroyed very quickly, and right before our eyes.</div>
</div>
<p>Perhaps that’s for the best—I really am open to the idea that this particular village needs to be destroyed to save the villagers—but nevertheless it triggers in me a sense of mourning; a window that is passing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Please do <a class="reference external" href="https://www.openml.fyi/2024-10-10/">read the whole thing</a>. I am somewhat sympathetic to those closing their sites off from automated crawling... but only somewhat. I have a few reactions:</p>
<ol></p><li><p>None of this will stop the rise of AI. I think most of these creators understand that and are pursuing this path as an expressive act.</p>
</li><li><p>There are <a class="reference external" href="https://observer.com/2024/07/ai-training-data-crisis/">indications</a> that legal restrictions on data collection are having an effect on training data availability. But these should be understood as commercial plays by entities in control of large corpora, who hope to use it to extract some value from the AI wave. Reddit and the New York Times are the most famous examples. This is distinct from the normative shift among creators that Luis describes.</p>
</li><li><p>AI disruption of creative industries will be real, though surely different than we imagine. I respect creators who are restricting access to their content out of a strong desire not to be complicit in that change, even though each individual's instrumental importance to the change is negligible.</p>
</li><li><p>While I respect that rationale, I join Luis in lamenting it, in large part because I think it sacrifices potential benefits, such as those he describes, while being unlikely to achieve much.</p>
</li><li><p>As is <a class="reference external" href="/2014/12/01/flickr-users-are-wrong/">often the case with retreats from openness</a>, much of the impetus for this normative change seems to stem from discomfort with who is benefiting from it. I believe this is because many advocates conceive open data as a revolutionary project to reallocate social power rather than a commitment flowing from moral and practical judgments about how knowledge can and should be restricted.</p>
</li><li><p>I empathize, having once held that perspective. But I've come to think it is ultimately a juvenile ideology, or at least one that's been proven to be unproductive. For one thing, people underestimate how quickly, if they did create a new set of winners and losers, they would come to resent the winners. And the perspective is also badly entangled with a press-led narrative about tech companies that frequently edges into hysteria.</p>
</li><li><p>But turnabout is fair play: some of the FAANG (AMAGO?) entities on the other side of this are responsible for strangling the open web while building ever-taller legal and technical palisades around the UGC they control.</p>

On the one hand, it might be for the best: if I'm right and their revolutionary project will never bear fruit, they probably should hop off the bus.

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>We have just returned home. Physically, we were in Vermont, working by remote for two weeks and vacationing for a third. Psychologically, we were in numerous locales. Caloric IPA City. A day trip to Diminished Parental Vigilance Island. Touring the Drug-Addicts-Are-Merely-Annoying,-Not-Dangerous District. But also: relaxing in the Land of Substantially Reduced Price Sensitivity.</p>
<p>We overpacked and had to leave the impulse to equivocate over every purchase at home. For me, this is an important part of vacation. Throw on an order of fries, grab a maple candy at checkout, opt for the nicer AirBnB. This is supposed to be fun!</p>
<p>But now we're back, and the house is full of fruit flies (forgotten nectarines make poor housesitters), and I'm primed to think about <a class="reference external" href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/the-coming-world-of-ubiquitous-price">Matt's article on price discrimination</a>. Really, <a class="reference external" href="https://x.com/tjl/status/1799177998199099879">I've been thinking about it for a while</a>, because it's a question that sends me in circles when I ponder it. My cursor hovered over the choices in his poll for a long time--and not because I hadn't thought about it before.</p>
<div class="float wp-block-image size-large docutils container">
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="/static/2024/08/image.png"><img alt="image1" class="wp-image-3634" src="/static/2024/08/image-1024x497.png" /></a></div>
<p>Matt runs through the usual and correct explanation for why price discrimination is good: it produces economically efficient outcomes, excavating both the consumer surplus and deadweight loss triangles on a traditional supply/demand graph and converting the extracted material into supplier profits. People don't like this process because they feel the lost consumer surplus more easily than they feel the gains from reducing deadweight loss or the improvements to their wages, retirement accounts, and municipal tax revenues. But this might be unwise of them.</p>
<p>Matt goes on to point out that even if everyone if left better off overall, there are other costs:</p>
<blockquote>
There’s something very oppressive-feeling about the idea of being constantly surveilled and having every micro-imperfection in the competitive environment (of which there are many, the real world is full of frictions) turned against you.</blockquote>
<p>This strikes me as correct, but not the whole story. There's something queasier about it.</p>
<p>Price discrimination is about gauging willingness to pay. For every purchase, there's some price at which it's no longer worth it. A price at which you'd rather keep the money and buy something else.</p>
<p>Matt grounds his discussion in reality, positing a fantastical but coherent brain-scanning technology for understanding the limits of consumer demand, while acknowledging the practical imperfections of retail surveillance and the complications introduced by substitutability. This is clearly the right way to argue about the advancement of information technology-enabled pricing tactics.</p>
<p>I want to excuse myself from that complexity, though, and instead will posit the Price Goblin. The goblin knows exactly what you are willing to pay in every circumstance, and informs the seller as you're walking to the register.</p>
<p>(Apologies to whoever holds the rights to the presumably-formerly-extant Price Goblin dot com intellectual property.)</p>
<p>In this world, there's no such thing as a good deal. As your eyes scan across the contents of your grocery cart, you feel uncertain. The brand of bread you got isn't your favorite, but you would not feel any better about buying your favorite, because it has been perfectly priced. The laundry detergent you selected is expensive enough to make you feel like you might as well take everything to the dry cleaner, even though doing so is less convenient. The goblin knows exactly how inconvenient it would be--he empathizes with how much you hate having to recycle the wire hangers you'll get back. He empathizes with quantum precision.</p>
<p>But perhaps good deals are overrated. How much of our mental energies do we devote to acquiring stuff? The goblin would liberate us from those concerns. No more bargain-hunting. No more careful budgeting. Think of all the tabs we could close! Maybe we would finally take guitar lessons.</p>
<p>And it's not like undoing consumerism would destroy capitalism. The goblin knows how much each person would enjoy a given product, so producers will still compete on quality, subject to the goblin's extensive QA testing. Of course, freedom from thinking about prices means we need some other way to prevent people from consuming more than their fair share. I guess we'll assign overall consumption quota management to the goblin, too. He's already going to have to build models for diminishing marginal utility, after all.</p>
<p>The standard move at this point in the essay is to make a pat observation about communism, ideally including a reference to an old Star Trek episode about a dystopia run by a supercomputer. That's fine as far as it goes for defining the goblin end of this argument's spectrum.</p>
<p>But more important than that, I think, is what happens when you get a raise or a better job under a goblin regime. The answer is: nothing. The goblin factors that in. In fact it's extremely easy for him to do this, because your new income is probably being sold between various data brokers. No arcane magicks are necessary. He knows you've got the new job, and can afford to pay more, and so you are going to. Suddenly everything in that grocery cart will be a little more expensive. But don't worry: you won't notice. There's nothing for you to notice.</p>
<p>I am now undeniably middle aged, and enduring the accompanying introspection. Sometimes I wish my young, clever self hadn't been quite so arrogant, and had undertaken some of the paths toward credentials that he excused himself from back in the day. It would be nice to feel like a big shot.</p>
<p>I understand at least some of why he didn't. When I was growing up I felt very anxious and jealous about money. I had everything I needed, but noticeably less than my peers (living, I should mention, in the richest region in the richest country in the richest era in human history). Not exclusively, and probably not optimally, but in various ways, I have chosen paths that pay well and don't require student loans. This is not because my tastes are exotic. I do insist on air conditioning and a refrigerator with an icemaker. But otherwise they're similar to the ones I was exposed to growing up. I drive a Kia, I take domestic vacations, and I save about as much as financial explainer articles tell me to.</p>
<p>What I really want from money is not to think about it--in particular, not to feel anxiety about it. In a sense, this makes the goblin sound pretty good. In another, he sounds terrible. There's no way to better your situation under the goblin's regime. If you gain a foothold, he will smooth it away.</p>
<p>Perhaps we could count on the goblin to do that responsibly: to allocate financial anxiety in a perfectly just manner. We're already asking a lot of the guy, but he's doing great so far. And people do like this idea in some contexts, like <a class="reference external" href="https://www.euronews.com/2023/01/04/finlands-progressive-punishment-when-it-comes-to-speeding-tickets">Finland's income-based fines for speeding</a>.</p>
<p>Still, I think a lot of people hate this idea viscerally. I think it's why voters recoil from inflation: suddenly, it has become harder to win. The goalposts have been moved, as the saying goes.</p>
<p>It's no coincidence that this is a classic way to escalate stakes and engender an audience's sympathy. From the Odyssey to Save The Cat's Beat Sheet, foiling a hero's noble effort to achieve their goal with an unanticipated setback can be counted on to rouse an audience's sense of unfairness and heighten their eagerness for resolution. It gets at something very deep in us, the kind of thing primatologists patiently tease from their wards with games about tokens and treats. <em>We think games should be winnable.</em></p>
<p>Obviously, the goblin sits at an unreachably distant end of the continuum I've described. Price discrimination is at least somewhat good, sometimes desirable, and often unavoidable. Even so: it's a short stroll goblinward before we humans find the dissonance unbearable. I can't blame any politician for thinking that voters will care more about stories than triangles on a graph.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>Tom MacWright has written <a class="reference external" href="https://macwright.com/2024/07/18/llms-democratizing-coding">an interesting post on LLMs and their effect on the discipline of programming</a>, noting that they represent a grimly ironic answer to his desire to democratize programming, since his enthusiasm for the project was about its potential to provide both intellectual and financial returns. LLMs allow programmers to write code without understanding it and to increase productivity without increasing skill, which might undermine compensation standards. Becoming a programmer is getting easier! But at the expense of the reasons for doing it at all.</p>
<p>I don't disagree with Tom's big-picture take. But I think there are a few more things worth considering, which I offer from a perspective that--I'm sorry to say--is a bit of a blind spot for him: that of a much worse programmer.</p>
<p>I am not abysmal, mind you. In particular, I write code with a pretty good mental model of its probable resource consumption, and have okay judgment about when to expend effort moving up or down the optimization-and-scalability ladder. I've worked with a lot of technologies. I've shipped code--not earth-shattering code, but production code nonetheless--to audiences in the hundreds of millions. And, because I've worked alongside or nearby some truly excellent programmers (such as Tom himself) I can still often teach an early-career programmer a thing or two.</p>
<p>But my limits are significant. For one thing, I'm pretty rusty. When I need to get something done I reach for Python and bash, neither of which are exactly fast-evolving ecosystems. I have never been immersed in the scene of open source foment--I can tell you what <tt class="docutils literal">bun</tt> is (was?), but not whether you should use it. And, most damningly, I don't care enough to get <em>really</em> good. Or maybe that's wrong: my problem is that my interests go down, not up. I am intrigued by instruction sets, registers, caches, half-adders, NAND gates, and electron holes, predictive branching calculations and DEF CON talks about weird side channel attacks. I like to know that stuff exists, and to understand it deeply enough to appreciate how it's connected, if not exactly how it's implemented. If you instead turn your gaze upward, away from system buses and laser-pulsed droplets of tin, the machine falls away entirely and you find yourself wandering amid a linguistic forest of abstract syntax trees. The arbitrariness of representational systems becomes apparent. You lose interest in giving computers lists of <em>things to do</em> and start giving them <em>ways to be.</em> Sometimes a quasi-mystical revelation arrives and you become able to create a new way of running global telecommunications infrastructure or stymying cybercriminals. Usually, you just wind up writing another LISP.</p>
<p>I have never had the affinity or assiduousness for that sort of thing, though I know enough to admire those who do. I am content to just bang out interpreted code to do something neat, hoping that if any part of it is too slow, someone smart will have put a compiled solution online for me to use. That's how good I am and probably how good I ever will be.</p>
<p>This turns out to be about the right level of competence for using LLMs. And let me just say: wow.</p>
<p>The React monoculture hadn't fully taken over by the time programming ceased to be my day job. I got the idea. But I'd never put in the reps for the plumbing to feel intuitive. &quot;Yes, I could figure this out,&quot; I told myself, &quot;But I have three kids and a real job.&quot; But now I just say: I'd like to use vite and Tailwind. I don't want my map to flicker when I update state. Please do not make me remember what a forward ref is for longer than is absolutely necessary. And it all works.</p>
<p>Another time: I wanted to build a mobile app. Mobile dev is a deep discipline that places enormous constraints on the developer, both in how they do their work and what their work can achieve relative to a normal computer, making it simultaneously intimidating and deflating. It's tempting to use a simplifying framework in a more familiar language--maybe with cross-platform compatibility?--but the fields of computing history are absolutely littered with such projects' corpses, making the investment of effort highly suspect. But now I can tell an LLM I want a Flutter list view based on some JSON it's pulled and, one Apple Developer fee later, I have an app for my stupid thermostat system.</p>
<p>Even native development is suddenly achievable. I couldn't possibly justify learning Swift and its associated ecosystems without a serious iOS need--you expect me to believe a language that's borrowed Perlisms like <tt class="docutils literal">$0</tt> is elegantly designed?!--but now I don't have to learn it to use it.</p>
<p>What I can't yet tell is how bad I could be while still benefiting from all this. I learned a lot about programming in the pre-LLM era, and that context lets me see when the robot is suggesting a dependency that's out of date, or an optimization that's premature, or a level of abstraction that's inappropriate, or an architecture that's going to bite me in the ass, or a response to an error message that's irrelevant. If I started my career today, I don't think I would need to learn those things, or at least wouldn't come to understand them in the same way, and I consequently wouldn't be able to spot the robot's missteps.</p>
<p>But that's only one part of programming. A lot of it is about pasting error messages into websites, and ChatGPT is a much better website for that than Google ever was.</p>
<p>Perhaps more importantly, the only time I've reached truly new levels of skill--not just knowledge, skill--it was because I was sitting next to a programmer better than me. When a junior programmer can find someone like that who's willing to indulge them, it's an immensely valuable opportunity. Now a close approximation can be rented for a few bucks a month.</p>
<p>This pattern of benefits seems to be consistent. <a class="reference external" href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/workers-less-experience-gain-most-generative-ai">Mediocre performers are helped by LLMs more than top performers</a>. So far, LLMs are an assistive technology. I choose to view this optimistically. I know a lot about computers, and much of it was learned during thankless hours when I was stuck searching for a path forward, without a better programmer sitting next to me. But much of the material I learned during those interludes was trivia--if I'd known what I was looking for I would have found it right away!--and only some of it was worth retaining. I don't cherish those hours.</p>
<p>The time I spent with a guiding hand expanded my understanding at a vastly greater rate, and I'm excited by the prospect of my children having an infinitely patient tutor available--for programming or whatever else--during the inevitable hours when a human isn't available. It's true that the palette of abstractions and details they learn will be twisted by LLM capabilities into a shape different from the one I developed. But that, at least, has ever been the case in CS. In my youth we thought all programmers needed to understand memory allocation!</p>
<p>I can't discuss the economic dimension of LLMs' impact as thoroughly, because it seems to me to be much less knowable. Frankly, I don't understand why programming is still such a good job to have. It's extremely outsource-able. It is, fundamentally, about moving information around to unlock efficiencies. Markets are pretty good about finding and shaving down inefficiencies and laptops and broadband connections are not big capital expenses. How much work remains? We are decades into the ICT revolution. <a class="reference external" href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/some-thoughts-on-the-future-of-the">Noah Smith thinks the tech industry might be approaching maturity</a>, in a process analogous to the build-out of the national freight rail network. I'm less certain than he is, in part because what counts as &quot;tech&quot; seems mostly to be a function of what adopting the term means for the user's financing prospects. But it does seem plausible.</p>
<p>It's also hard to know what counterfactuals could have or might be possible. How much have the FAANG monopolists bid up salaries as a bet on their future and/or against their competitors'? How much more work would be available if the platforms hadn't swallowed the web, homogenizing and sanitizing it into a handful of monolithic services? These are inputs to the equation that I can't properly estimate.</p>
<p>Ultimately the economic question boils down to familiar arguments (once thought resolved, recently reopened on appeal): comparisons to Luddites, revisionist accounts of the Luddites, midwit memes about the Luddites; promises of expanding pies and productivity growth and redistribution under neoliberalism and how mad we are about all of it, whatever it might be, exactly.</p>
<p>I don't completely trust anyone's intuitions on these matters, certainly including my own. But inventing tools that let us do more is usually good, I think, especially when what we're doing more of is benign enough to remain safely confined to a screen.</p>
<p>I hope I'm dead before chatbots become digital people who displace my descendants' labor. When that happens I think it's going to be a rough time for everybody. But the chatbots who can write fragments of code are already here. I'm pretty sure about that. And I think it'll be okay.</p>

                    <p>Some of Silicon Valley's top figures have recently declared their support for Donald Trump. The failed attempt on Trump's life offered congenial timing for this kind of announcement, and these men are professional opportunity-noticers, after all. But their changed allegiance seems to have been brewing for a while. It's interesting to consider the reasons for it.</p>
<p>This is in part because Donald Trump provides such a starkly ridiculous apparatus for thought experiments. A mercurial and easily-corrupted fool, there can be no serious argument that he's anything less than a harbinger of the end of America's tenure as global paragon. If they were able to separate themselves from what must be an overwhelming emotional tide, it would be obvious to all but the most dull-witted businessmen that Trump's elevation is not in their interest. I suppose we can grant special dispensation to the crypto hucksters, neo-reactionary dum-dums, and in-the-closet kompromat victims. But that still leaves a chunky remainder of guys in embroidered vests.</p>
<p>What are they thinking, then? A compelling explanation emerged this week, nicely summarized by <a class="reference external" href="https://stratechery.com/2024/tech-for-trump-breaking-the-deal-from-inertness-to-interest/">Ben Thompson</a> but first captured by <a class="reference external" href="https://x.com/KelseyTuoc/status/1813315919697027559">Kelsey Piper</a> after having listened to <a class="reference external" href="https://pmarca.substack.com/p/new-podcast-little-tech-agenda-the">an illuminating Andreesen/Horowitz podcast</a> where the dynamic was discussed frankly.</p>
<div class="float wp-block-image aligncenter size-full docutils container">
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="/static/2024/07/image-1.png"><img alt="image1" class="wp-image-3587" src="/static/2024/07/image-1.png" /></a></div>
<p>Thompson notes that this goes back even further, connecting it to election-related criticism of Facebook and their resulting investment in remedies that seemed to just make people madder:</p>
<blockquote>
In short, you have an industry that has been endlessly vilified in the press, bent over backwards to do what the press demanded, but instead of receiving credit for those efforts, has only seen itself even more isolated and under siege.</blockquote>
<p>This change has been real--<a class="reference external" href="https://x.com/KelseyTuoc/status/1588231892792328192">here's Piper again</a>, noting a strikingly antagonistic editorial policy toward the tech industry from the very top of Mt. Dispassionate Journalism:</p>
<div class="float wp-block-image aligncenter size-full docutils container">
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="/static/2024/07/image-3.png"><img alt="image2" class="wp-image-3589" src="/static/2024/07/image-3.png" /></a></div>
<p>(Matt deletes his tweets, so it's not easy to see the full context, sorry)</p>
<p>This change was probably inevitable. Journalists are told to <a class="reference external" href="https://www.poynter.org/reporting-editing/2014/today-in-media-history-mr-dooley-the-job-of-the-newspaper-is-to-comfort-the-afflicted-and-afflict-the-comfortable/">comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable</a>. They're not alone. Everyone likes an underdog: American (and consequently global) culture is overwhelmingly supportive of directing skepticism toward concentrations of power. That tech's economic and cultural ascendance came at the direct expense of the journalism industry doubtless helped lessen the friction of any editorial handwringing about an unabashedly antagonistic approach to coverage.</p>
<p>Still, it took a moment for everyone to align against our new villains. <a class="reference external" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/30/magazine/barack-obama-brought-silicon-valley-to-washington-is-that-a-good-thing.html">The Obama administration was full of tech industry veterans</a>, binding their products' novelty into the same moment of optimism and enthusiasm that accompanied his historic election. And while vague anti-bigness animus and specific injuries to disrupted industries are easy to understand, it took some time and experimentation to construct a more practical critique of tech out of arguments about inequality (old news), privacy harms (vague), and various ideas that were in tension with the media's historically fervent embrace of the First Amendment.</p>
<p>When the shift finally took hold it must have felt sudden to its targets. That's reflected in the &quot;broken deal&quot; narrative above. These guys thought they could become rich and powerful and remain beloved. Weren't they the good ones? Here's the key podcast section that Thompson cites:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><strong>MA:</strong>&nbsp;I actually endorsed Hillary Clinton in 2016 publicly for what I thought were a variety of good reasons. And the way I would describe it is, I’m Gen X, I kind of came of age in the 90s as an entrepreneur. Almost everybody I knew, including myself, just took it for granted, which is like, of course, you’re a Democrat. Of course, you support the Democratic president. And the answer is the formula resolves to an easy answer, which is the Democrats in those days, you know, presidential level were pro-business, they were pro-tech, they were pro-startup. They were pro-America winning in tech markets. They were pro-entrepreneurship. And so you could start a company. They were pro-business. You could be in business. You could be successful in business. You could make a lot of money. And then you give the money away in philanthropy and you get enormous credit for that. And, you know, it absolves you of whatever.</div>
<div class="line"><strong>BH:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, well, I was going to say, like, it’s obvious you’re to be a Democrat because you have to be to be a good person. That’s kind of the underlying thing.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><strong>MA:</strong>&nbsp;But specifically successful business people could then basically become successful philanthropists. This is the path that Gates and many others kind of carved out. And then you could be progressive on social issues, and you could be on the right side of all these sort of societal changes that people were kind of focused on at the time. And the whole thing just seemed completely obvious and completely easy. So I was kind of on that path, frankly, quite strongly through at least 2016.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">In retrospect, it’s like there were glimmers of, I’d say, growing anti-tech, I would say animus, probably in the early 2010s. And there were growing kind of anti-business sentiments. And then by the way, something that really disturbed me a while back is sort of growing anti-philanthropy sentiments, which we probably won’t discuss it like today.</div>

<div class="line"><strong>BH:</strong>&nbsp;Oh, well, yeah. Well, with people who made a lot of money, who gave money away, got criticized for giving money away to charitable causes as opposed to paying more taxes. Kind of a funny life jealousy taken to the extreme, yeah.</div>

<p><strong>MA:</strong>&nbsp;A specific moment that happened to me to make me realize the landscape was shifting was when Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan set up the Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative where they literally committed to 99 of their assets going to the Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative, there was a political faction that basically heavily criticized them, and the theory, number one is to your point, the theory was that they should they should pay it in taxes and the government should distribute the money, they shouldn’t have any control over where it goes, but the other was oh they’re only doing it for a tax break.</p>

<p>I think that most people want to feel that they are good. They work to reconcile that need against their own desires. It is frustrating when the rules that define what counts as <em>being good</em> are changed, particularly when you've already made big investments in a lifelong project that was built upon those rules. There's a very strong temptation to discount the new rules as arbitrary--a product of bad faith, ignorance, false consciousness, whatever. If you do this, the project of reconciling your own desires against the rules suddenly looks very different.</p>
<p>The accompanying mood is a mix of frustration, nihilism, resignation, and rebelliousness. I think the best word for it is petulance. And to me it feels like the defining emotion of our political age.</p>
<p>VCs and reddit blackpillers are one thing. America's police officers are another. There's consensus that America experienced a significant pull-back by police in recent years. Scholars are <a class="reference external" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1745-9125.12363">still debating</a> how much of this should be attributed to the pandemic versus the defunding rhetoric that reached a national crescendo in the wake of George Floyd's death. I've seen enough unhinged tweets from police union officials to believe I understand the psychology of the latter, even if its causal significance could use another regression or two.</p>
<p>In the last two decades, perceptions of cops have swung from a 9/11 apotheosis as heroic first responders to an ACAB consensus among the cultural vanguard that cops must surely feel is implicit in every blue-jurisdiction yard sign they pass. The rules changed, and they don't like it.</p>
<p>I say all of this with some sympathy. I have felt petulant as the world changed around me. I put it into words <a class="reference external" href="/2015/04/08/dead-guys/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Petulance is never an admirable reaction, even if the new rules really are under-justified. But I do think it's a reaction that we would all do better to expect, plan for, and understand. That doesn't mean that we can't change the rules. Many of the rules should be changed! But when we change them, we will be wise to allow the dislocated to embrace the new rules. This will frequently be annoying. I think I understand why it's satisfying and fun to respond with exasperated derision when some guy prefaces his stab at allyship with a proof-of-daughters statement. But where does that leave him? If he isn't permitted to come along, where will he go instead?</p>
<p>I have <a class="reference external" href="/2023/01/27/who-will-be-ais-audience/">written before</a> about the overwhelming power I see in the human impulse to organize ourselves in hierarchies. Who's up, who's down; who's good, who's bad. It's perfectly natural, and usually satisfying. But it's not always necessary. Often--especially in politics--it might be better to limit ourselves to declaiming <em>what</em> is good, rather than who.</p>
<p>None of this excuses petulance. It's a childish emotion that should be recognized and controlled. Allowing it to drive you into a public tantrum is embarrassing. Allowing it to drive you toward a figure like Donald Trump should be profoundly chastening. I wonder how these guys think they will be understood a decade from now. Have thought about it at all? To embrace petulance is to let go of dissonance. Not having to think quite so hard is part of the appeal.</p>
<p>When the time comes, I suspect they will feel pretty mortified about this period. Then again, who won't?</p>
<p>For now, the petulant impulse is real, and--for whatever reason--has recently become of outsize importance. Most people need a way to feel that they are good. When we can, we should make sure they have one.</p>

<p>One of the nicest things about writing something that connects with people is that many of them share links and thoughts that make you smarter (and would have improved the piece if you'd had them in the first place). I want to briefly discuss four responses I got: two studies that people pointed me toward, some stats that I wasn't aware of, and one reactive essay.</p>
<div class="section" id="red-light-and-speed-cameras-analyzing-the-equity-and-efficacy-of-chicagos-automated-camera-enforcement-program">
<h2>Red-Light and Speed Cameras: Analyzing the Equity and Efficacy of Chicago’s Automated Camera Enforcement Program</h2>
<p>This <a class="reference external" href="https://indigo.uic.edu/articles/report/Red_Light_and_Speed_Cameras_Analyzing_the_Equity_and_Efficacy_of_Chicago_s_Automated_Camera_Enforcement_Program/22184059">study</a> takes a deep look at Chicago ATE data. <strong>It found that cameras improve safety</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
Over the 3-year period from 2015-2017, we estimate that there were 36 fewer KA type injury crashes, 68 fewer type B crashes, and 100 fewer type C crashes across the 101 locations. In all, there were 204 fewer injury crashes. Reductions of type A and C crashes were estimated at around 15% and that for type B injuries at 9%. Overall, speed cameras led to a 12% reduction in injury crashes.</blockquote>
<p>But the study is most notable because, unlike my analysis of DC data, the study's authors had access to the zip code of citation recipients. This allowed them to examine the incidence of tickets versus Census demographics in a much more defensible manner than the camera/neighborhood spatial association that I criticized the DCPC study for using.</p>
<p>After controlling for various factors, they found that Black households <em>do</em> receive a higher number of citations than white or hispanic households. They did not find disparate placement of cameras, however.</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="float wp-block-image size-large docutils container">
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="/static/2024/04/image-36.png"><img alt="image1" class="wp-image-3570" src="/static/2024/04/image-36-1024x674.png" /></a></div>
<p>[T]<em>ickets per household</em> for both speed and red-light cameras are higher in majority Black areas, followed by majority Hispanic/Latinx areas, and finally majority White/Other areas. At the <em>camera level</em>, however, we do not find such relationships. Cameras in majority Hispanic/Latinx areas tend to issue fewer tickets than others for both red-light and speed cameras. There is not a statistical difference in ticketing rates between cameras installed majority Black and majority White/Other areas for red-light cameras, and there is weak evidence that rates of ticketing by cameras in majority White/Other areas are lower than those in majority Black areas for speed cameras.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They also found that cameras on big, fast roads issue a disproportionate number of citations, which is consistent with my own findings from examining DC data.</p>
<div class="float wp-block-image size-large docutils container">
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="/static/2024/04/image-37.png"><img alt="image2" class="wp-image-3571" src="/static/2024/04/image-37-1024x756.png" /></a></div>
<p>The second part of the study examines these citations' economic impact in terms of different groups' level of wealth. Late fees and payment rates emerge as a significant part of the picture.</p>
<p>I think this study provides real evidence of a disparate impact, but doesn't provide a clear explanation of why it's occurring. It's also important to keep the actual scale of the effect in mind: as you can see on the graph above, the per-household gap is about [STRIKEOUT:one speeding ticket every ten years]. That deserves attention, but should also be kept in perspective.</p>
<p><strong>CORRECTION:</strong> Figure 1 shows a difference of one red light camera every ten years. The speed camera gap is about one ticket every four years.</p>

<h2>Do Speed Cameras Save Lives?</h2>
<p>I was also pointed toward <a class="reference external" href="https://eprints.lse.ac.uk/86567/1/sercdp0221.pdf">this paper</a>, by the Spatial Economics Research Centre, which examines cameras in the UK. I appreciate the friendly manner in which it was <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/gunz4sale/status/1779171961827967290">shared with me</a> by someone who I take to be an ATE skeptic, but I think it helps his case less than he imagined. <strong>This study also found that cameras improve safety</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
[S]peed cameras unambiguously reduce both the counts and severity of collisions. After installing a camera, the number of accidents and minor injuries fell by 17%-39% and 17%-38%, which amounts to 0.89-2.36 and 1.19-2.87 per kilometre. As for seriousness of the crashes, the number of fatalities and serious injuries decrease by 0.08-0.19 and 0.25-0.58 per kilometre compared to pre-installation levels, which represents a drop of 58%-68% and 28%-55% respectively. Putting these estimates into perspective, installing another 1,000 speed cameras reduce around 1,130 collisions, mitigate 330 serious injuries, and save 190 lives annually, generating benefits of around £21 million.</blockquote>
<p>Rather than confirming that cameras on highways generate outsize numbers of citations, it found that cameras <em>ought</em> to be placed on highways, because that's where their safety benefits will be greatest:</p>
<blockquote>
[I]t is more effective to install cameras along roads at higher speed limits as much larger reductions in collision outcomes are observed</blockquote>
<p>Finally, the study found mild evidence of &quot;rebound&quot; effect outside of camera locations. I think this is why the study was shared with me: my reply-guy was arguing that cameras just push crashes around. I don't buy that argument, and it doesn't seem like the paper's author does, either. Or at least he thinks the problem could be solved by--you guessed it--more cameras:</p>
<blockquote>
Beyond 1.5 kilometres from the camera, there are suggestive evidence of a rebound in collisions, injuries and deaths, indicating drivers could have speed up beyond camera surveillance and cause more accidents. These results, which illustrate the limitations associated with speed cameras, suggest that newer prototypes, such as mobile or variable speed cameras, should be considered.</blockquote>

<h2>Demographic Safety Data</h2>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/myrna38717/status/1778898409748877414">Eileen S. made me aware</a> that some safety data exists with a race-ethnicity breakdown, albeit with a notable time lag. Eventually I poked around and realized there are quite a few comparable resources for examining the question.</p>
<p>First, consider <a class="reference external" href="https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/813493">NHTSA's data on fatalities per 100,000 people</a>, which shows that the Black community is suffering from our deadly roads at a rate second only to people of native heritage.</p>
<div class="float wp-block-image size-large docutils container">
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="/static/2024/04/image-38.png"><img alt="image3" class="wp-image-3572" src="/static/2024/04/image-38-1024x514.png" /></a></div>
<p>NHTSA also provides stats breaking down the percentage of traffic fatalities that are related to speeding:</p>
<div class="float wp-block-image size-large docutils container">
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="/static/2024/04/image-39.png"><img alt="image4" class="wp-image-3573" src="/static/2024/04/image-39-1024x391.png" /></a></div>
<p>All of this is looks even worse when you consider different groups' urban/rural split:</p>
<div class="float wp-block-image size-large docutils container">
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="/static/2024/04/image-40.png"><img alt="image5" class="wp-image-3574" src="/static/2024/04/image-40-1024x434.png" /></a></div>
<p>and by <a class="reference external" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0749379722001556">academic estimates of demographic differences in vehicle miles traveled (VMT)</a>:</p>
<div class="float wp-block-image size-large docutils container">
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="/static/2024/04/image-41.png"><img alt="image6" class="wp-image-3575" src="/static/2024/04/image-41-1024x569.png" /></a></div>
<p>(See also <a class="reference external" href="https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/813188">here</a> for a longer NHTSA report on this topic)</p>
<p>I would expect lower VMT, tilted toward urban areas, to mean a lower incidence of speeding-related deaths. But that is not what the data shows.</p>
<p>I don't know why this disparity exists. My hunch is that it has something to do with the kinds of built environments that disadvantaged groups have to settle for. I am quite wary of bringing it up, because of the risk that a reader will mistake it for an argument about blame. That is not my intention: it's an argument about victimization and suffering. I think it's essential context for anyone who wants to discuss the possibility of ATE's disparate impact.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="dccarviolence-s-essay">
<h2>&#64;DCCarViolence's essay</h2>
<p>I want to thank Joseph Oschrin for taking the time to write <a class="reference external" href="https://medium.com/&#64;DCCarViolence/tom-lees-deep-dive-on-black-drivers-and-dc-speed-cameras-vision-zero-or-zero-vision-9ca1b2c4b7ff">this response</a>. I appreciate the work he does on Twitter, too. The crux of his argument is that ATE--and in particular, debating the disparate impact of ATE--is an unfortunate waste of time, and that instead we ought to focus on road diets and other interventions to our infrastructure.</p>
<p>I agree that those kinds of changes are the most desirable way to make streets safer. The problem is that they are wildly expensive--not just in dollars and cents, but in years spent planning, compromising, and--as this week has reminded us--suffering <a class="reference external" href="https://gwhatchet.com/2024/04/18/ddot-abandons-plan-to-add-protected-bike-lanes-in-connecticut-avenue-stretch/">abrupt reversals</a>.</p>
<p>Oschrin maintains that cameras are consuming resources that could be spent on other kinds of interventions. I have a hard time seeing the evidence for this. The bottlenecks to reforming our infrastructure are big problems of budgets and politics. A speed camera program, by contrast, seems to mostly require exchanging emails with a vendor.</p>
<p>Cameras are proven to save lives. They pay for themselves. They don't consume human enforcement resources. And they don't engage in racial profiling.</p>
<p>The only problem with cameras is that everyone hates them and indulges in motivated reasoning to justify that distaste. I sometimes imagine how an ATE option might work in SimCity: click here to trade popularity for income and safety!</p>
<p>Maybe not the <em>most</em> fun game mechanic. But I think it's a great real-world trade and that we should keep taking it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-steer-act-and-a-prediction">
<h2>The STEER Act, and a prediction</h2>
<p>I didn't spend much time discussing the economic analysis included in the Chicago study. That's because, to a significant degree, that argument has already been digested here in DC. Advocates argued convincingly that citations' safety benefits are coming at a relative cost to lower-income residents that is unfairly high.</p>
<p>This resulted in a period of legislative churn, during which the Council removed some of the usual consequences for not paying your tickets. I think that was a bad idea.</p>
<p>But more recently they passed the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.charlesallenward6.com/councilmember_allen_schedules_committee_vote_on_traffic_safety_legislation_addressing_repeat_dangerous_drivers">STEER Act</a> (currently under congressional review). And I think it's an impressive response: it will mean that the consequences of our speed enforcement system will increasingly be felt in non-financial ways, including traffic safety classes (aka white collar prison dispensed on an hourly basis), license suspensions and--amazingly--automotive speed governor devices for the worst offenders. I think it's a thorough response to arguments about economic inequity raised by ATE critics and I am looking forward to its implementation.</p>
<p>I also think it will do approximately nothing to silence ATE criticism. <em>People do not like being punished for bad driving.</em> This is perfectly normal. Nobody likes being punished. Nobody likes to imagine that they are potentially culpable for the vast amounts of death and injury on our roads. Nobody wants to believe that the sense of freedom they experience behind the wheel ought to be curtailed. People will invent new arguments for why the punishment is unjust, or the deaths are imaginary, or the safety benefit is fake, or the privacy impact is unacceptable, or the carbon footprint is too big, or the streetscape's natural beauty is being destroyed, or the imposition of driving standards threatens traditional masculinity, or something even stupider that I can't yet imagine.</p>
<p>That's fine. Sometimes, when someone is wrong, and after you have listened to them with a polite, blank expression, you must look within yourself, accept that you might get yelled at, and summon the courage to ignore them.</p>

                    <p><em>This is the second of my posts about speed cameras.</em> <a class="reference external" href="/2024/04/12/are-dcs-traffic-cameras-racist/">Part 1 is here</a><em>.</em> <a class="reference external" href="/2024/04/19/speed-cameras-legacy/">Part 3 is here</a><em>.</em></p>
<p>I'm amazed by the reaction that <a class="reference external" href="/2024/04/12/are-dcs-traffic-cameras-racist/">my post on ATE cameras</a> elicited. Thanks to everyone who took the time to read and share it. Seeing this level of interest provided inspiration to look at a couple of lingering questions I had (and to learn how to make my MatPlotLib graphs marginally less ugly).</p>
<p>In my last post I showed that ATE speed cameras are highly skewed toward highway traffic. I also argued that looking at the demographics around highway speed camera locations doesn't tell us much about the equity impact of the citations being issued. That is the main point I wanted to convey and I am not going to qualify it here.</p>
<p>But even though non-highway effects are a less important part of the ATE picture, it is still interesting to examine them from an equity perspective. So I ran the per-ward analysis of <em>camera days</em> and <em>total citations</em> while excluding cameras associated with the largest road classes (&quot;motorway&quot; and &quot;trunk&quot;). By excluding very large roads we can be more confident that the citations are reaching people who live in the area.</p>
<p>Camera days, you will recall, is a metric meant to capture the overall level of ATE monitoring by counting up the number of days that each camera issued at least one citation (indicating that the camera was installed and active).</p>
<div class="float wp-block-image size-large docutils container">
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="/static/2024/04/image-29.png"><img alt="image1" class="wp-image-3560" src="/static/2024/04/image-29-1024x389.png" /></a></div>

<p>Maybe ward 7's a little high; maybe ward 8's a little low. Nothing seems particularly scandalous, though. Ward 5 looks fishy--could a highway camera be getting mistakenly included?--but visual inspection of these shows nothing amiss:</p>
<div class="float wp-block-image size-large docutils container">
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="/static/2024/04/image-31.png"><img alt="image3" class="wp-image-3562" src="/static/2024/04/image-31-1024x896.png" /></a></div>
<p>Ward 5 just has a lot of camera activity along North Cap and South Dakota Ave. Similarly, Ward 7 is showing elevated numbers because of the one RFK site--mentioned in the last post, and notable for generating a ton of citations but <em>not</em> being on a highway--and for having more cameras on peripheral streets (Southern and Eastern Ave) than Ward 8, which is probably appropriate given those streets' extremely dangerous reputation.</p>
<p>Rereading my post made me realize that the precipitating tweet didn't describe the DCPC study correctly, and instead referred to red light cameras. My last post focused on cameras that issue speed citations, for reasons I explained at the time. But we can also look at other types of ATE. I came up with the following list of violation codes by eyeballing citation counts. When a code was responsible for 100x as many citations as others, it seemed like a pretty safe bet that it was being generated by robots. Here's the list I used:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
T113 | FAIL TO STOP PER REGULATIONS FACING RED SIGNAL
T128 | PASSING STOP SIGN WITHOUT COMING TO A FULL STOP
T202 | RIGHT TURN ON RED, VIOLATION NO TURN ON RED SIGN
T334 | TURN RIGHT ON RED WITHOUT COMPLETE STOP
</pre>
<p>I ran the same query using these codes instead of the speeding violation codes, while still looking only at citations from agencies that reflect ATE activity:</p>
<div class="float wp-block-image size-large docutils container">
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="/static/2024/04/image-32.png"><img alt="image4" class="wp-image-3563" src="/static/2024/04/image-32-1024x379.png" /></a></div>

<p>The distribution of these red light and stop sign cameras seems reasonable enough, but it is worth noting that Ward 7 residents are getting a larger share of citations than their share of camera days would suggest (though again: all of this is a small fraction of highway-related citations). Looking at the data, there's a particular location along 27th St SE that's responsible for a staggering 77% of the non-speed, non-motorway/trunk citations in the ward--over 117,000 for <tt class="docutils literal">PASSING STOP SIGN WITHOUT COMING TO A FULL STOP</tt>. That one camera is a stone-cold killer; watch out, ward 7.</p>

<p>Lastly, I did want to note one irregularity that's hard to miss. As discussed already, human-issued citations for speeding are a negligible part of the overall citation picture. Still, I think it's fair to say that the psychological effect of cops sitting in speed traps looms large. And it is notable that MPD district 7 does basically no human speed enforcement:</p>
<div class="float wp-block-image size-large docutils container">
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="/static/2024/04/image-35.png"><img alt="image7" class="wp-image-3566" src="/static/2024/04/image-35-1024x617.png" /></a></div>
<p>That's right: in the time period studied, district 2 officers wrote more than one hundred times as many citations for speeding as district 7 officers.</p>
<p>(We have eight wards but 7 MPD districts, but it's not hard to adjust: district 6 serves ward 7 and district 7 serves ward 8, <a class="reference external" href="https://dcgis.maps.arcgis.com/apps/InformationLookup/index.html?appid=9b33920cad0a4c0796e4567100c72fef">more or less</a>.)</p>
<p>This is something I'd like to dig into more. Did district 7 deprioritize human speed enforcement because of a recognition that ATE does the job better? Because human officers were needed for other, more pressing tasks? Was this a policy change that lined up with the dawning national awareness that traffic stops pose outsize risks to Black Americans? Could it be that ATE's debut was especially jarring to ward 8 residents because they were accustomed to an era of extremely low speed enforcement that preceded it? I'll have to load more historical data to answer these questions.</p>

                    <p><em>This is the first of my posts about speed cameras.</em> <a class="reference external" href="/2024/04/13/traffic-cameras-extended-edition/">Part 2 is here</a><em>.</em> <a class="reference external" href="/2024/04/19/speed-cameras-legacy/">Part 3 is here</a><em>.</em></p>
<p>The two most important things about speed cameras are that they save lives and that they are annoying. People think life-saving is good. They also think getting tickets is bad. These two beliefs are dissonant. Social psychology tells us that people will naturally seek to reconcile dissonant beliefs.</p>
<p>There are lots of ways to do this, some easier than others. For speed cameras, it typically means constructing a rationale for why <em>cameras don't really save lives</em> or why <em>life-saving initiatives aren't admirable.</em> A common approach is to claim that municipalities are motivated by ticket revenue, not safety, when implementing automated traffic enforcement (ATE). This implies that cameras' safety benefits might be overstated, and that ATE proponents are behaving selfishly. Most people understand that this is transparently self-serving bullshit. It's not really interesting enough to write about.</p>
<p>But there's another dissonance-resolving strategy that popped into my feed recently that merits a response: <em>what if speed cameras are racist?</em></p>
<p>This strategy doesn't attempt to dismiss the safety rationale. Instead, it subordinates it. <em>Sure, this intervention might save lives</em>, the thinking goes, <em>but it is immoral and other (unspecified, unimplemented) approaches to life-saving ought to be preferred.</em></p>
<p>This argument got some <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/samswey/status/1770122530873098679?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1770122530873098679%7Ctwgr%5E7126f9ff618fac7c5c91f5987da40999ba4aad3a%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftomlee.wtf%2Fwp-admin%2Fpost.php%3Fpost%3D3509action%3Dedit">fresh life</a> recently, citing <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dcpolicycenter.org/publications/predominately-black-neighborhoods-in-d-c-bear-the-brunt-of-automated-traffic-enforcement/">a DC Policy Center study</a> that makes the case using data from my own backyard.</p>
<div class="float wp-block-image aligncenter size-large docutils container">
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="/static/2024/04/image-3.png"><img alt="image1" class="wp-image-3513" src="/static/2024/04/image-3-1024x337.png" /></a></div>
<p>I appreciate the work that the DC Policy Center does. Full disclosure: I've even cited this study approvingly in the past (albeit on a limited basis). But this tweet makes me worry that their work is transmuting into a factoid that is used to delegitimize ATE. I think that would be unfortunate.</p>
<p>So let's look at this more closely. We can understand the study and its limitations. And, because DC publishes very detailed traffic citation data, we can examine the question of camera placement and citation issuance for ourselves--including from an equity perspective--and come to an understanding of what's actually going on.</p>
<div class="section" id="what-does-the-dcpc-study-show">
<h2>What does the DCPC study SHOW?</h2>
<p>The most important result from the study is shown below:</p>
<div class="float wp-block-image size-full docutils container">
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="/static/2024/04/image-4.png"><img alt="image2" class="wp-image-3514" src="/static/2024/04/image-4.png" /></a></div>
<p>The study reaches this conclusion by binning citation data into Census tracts, then binning those tracts into five buckets by their Black population percentage, and looking at the totals.</p>
<p>Descriptively, the claim is correct. The Blackest parts of DC appear to be getting outsize fines. But the &quot;60-80% white&quot; column is also a clear outlier, and there's no theory offered for why racism--which is not explicitly suggested by the study, but which is being inferred by its audience--would result in that pattern.</p>
<p>To the study's credit, it acknowledges that the overall effect is driven by a small number of outlier Census tracts. Here's how they discuss it at the study's main link:</p>
<blockquote>
Further inspection reveals five outlier tracts which warrant closer inspection. Four of these outliers were found in 80-100 percent black tracts while one was found in a 60-80 percent white tract. Of course, by removing these extreme values, the remaining numbers in each racial category do fall much closer to the average. But notably, the number of citations and total fines per resident within black-segregated tracts remains 29 percent and 19 percent higher than the citywide average, even after removing the outlier locations. Meanwhile, the considerably lower numbers of citations and fines within 80-100 percent white census tracts remain considerably lower than average.&nbsp;<strong>(For a more in-depth discussion of the results and the effect of these outliers, please see&nbsp;**`the accompanying methods post on the D.C. Policy Center’s Data Blog &lt;https://dc-policy-center.github.io/posts/automated-traffic-enforcement&gt;`__**.)</strong></blockquote>
<p>But if you click through to that &quot;methods post&quot; you'll find this table, which has been calculated without those outlier tracts. The language quoted above isn't inaccurate. But it's also clearly trying to conceal the truth that, with those outliers removed, the study's impressive effect disappears.</p>

<div class="section" id="what-do-we-know-about-dc-s-ate-cameras">
<h2>What do we know about DC's ATE cameras?</h2>
<p>Let's take a step back and look at this less reactively. What do we know about DC speed cameras?</p>
<p>The most useful source of data on the topic is DC's moving violation citation data. It's published on a monthly basis. You can find a typical month, including a description of the included data fields, <a class="reference external" href="https://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/DCGIS::moving-violations-issued-in-january-2022/about">here</a>. I had previously loaded data spanning from January 2019 to April 2023 into a PostGIS instance when working on <a class="reference external" href="/2023/02/03/fake-tags-are-a-real-problem/">this post</a>, so that's the period upon which the following analysis is based.</p>
<p>The first important signal we have to work with is the <em>issuing agency.</em> When we bin citations in this way, we see two huge outliers:</p>
<div class="float wp-block-image aligncenter size-full docutils container">
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="/static/2024/04/image-6.png"><img alt="image4" class="wp-image-3516" src="/static/2024/04/image-6.png" /></a></div>
<p>ROC North and Special Ops/Traffic are enormous outliers by volume. We can be sure that these represent speed cameras by looking at <em>violation_process_desc</em> for these agencies' citations: they're all for violations related to speeding, incomplete stops, and running red lights. The stuff that ATE cameras in DC detect, in other words.</p>
<p>I am primarily interested in ATE's effect on safety. The relationship between speeding and safety is very well established. The relationship between safety, red light running and stop sign violations is less well-studied. So I confined my analysis to the most clear-cut and voluminous citation codes, which account for 86% of the citations in the dataset:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
 violation_code |          violation_process_desc
----------------+------------------------------------------
 T118           | SPEED UP TO TEN MPH OVER THE SPEED LIMIT
 T119           | SPEED 11-15 MPH OVER THE SPEED LIMIT
 T120           | SPEED 16-20 MPH OVER THE SPEED LIMIT
 T121           | SPEED 21-25 MPH OVER THE SPEED LIMIT
 T122           | SPEED 26-30 MPH OVER THE SPEED LIMIT
</pre>
<p>I'm not going to focus on human speed enforcement, but it is interesting to examine its breakdown by agency:</p>
<div class="float wp-block-image aligncenter size-full docutils container">
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="/static/2024/04/image-7.png"><img alt="image5" class="wp-image-3517" src="/static/2024/04/image-7.png" /></a></div>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://ddot.dc.gov/publication/automated-traffic-enforcement-camera-locations">DC publishes the location of its ATE cameras</a>, but it's easier to get this information from the citation data than from a PDF. Each citation record includes a latitude and longitude, but it's only specified to three decimal places. This results in each citation's location being &quot;snapped&quot; to a finite set of points within DC. It looks like this:</p>
<div class="float wp-block-image aligncenter size-full docutils container">
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="/static/2024/04/image-10.png"><img alt="image6" class="wp-image-3520" src="/static/2024/04/image-10.png" /></a></div>
<p>When an ATE camera is deployed in a particular location, every citation it issues gets the same latitude/longitude pair. This lets us examine not only the number of camera locations, but the number of days that a camera was in a particular location.</p>
<p>One last puzzle piece before we get started in earnest: DC's wards. The city is divided into eight of them. And while you'd be a fool to call anything having to do with race in DC &quot;simple&quot;, the wards do make some kinds of equity analysis straightforward, both because they have approximately equal populations:</p>
<div class="float wp-block-image aligncenter size-full docutils container">
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="/static/2024/04/image-11.png"><img alt="image7" class="wp-image-3521" src="/static/2024/04/image-11.png" /></a></div>
<p>And because wards 7 and 8--east of the Anacostia River--are the parts of the city with the highest percentage of Black people. They're also the city's <a class="reference external" href="https://mchb.tvisdata.hrsa.gov/Narratives/Overview/258318d0-8dbe-46fd-9a77-385b6753e1c7">poorest wards</a>.</p>

<p>With these facts in hand, we can start looking at the distribution and impact of the city's ATE cameras.</p>
<ul></p><li><p>Are ATE cameras being placed equitably?</p>
</li><li><p>Are ATE cameras issuing citations equitably?</p>
</li></ul><div class="float wp-block-image aligncenter size-full docutils container">
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="/static/2024/04/image-14.png"><img alt="image9" class="wp-image-3524" src="/static/2024/04/image-14.png" /></a></div>

<p>A high <em>camera location:camera days</em> ratio suggests deployment of fewer fixed cameras and more mobile cameras. A high <em>citation:camera day</em> ratio suggests cameras are being deployed in locations that generate more citations, on average.</p>
<p>We can look at this last question in more detail, calculating a <em>citations per camera day</em> metric for each location and mapping it. Here's the result:</p>
<div class="float wp-block-image aligncenter size-full docutils container">
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="/static/2024/04/image-17.png"><img alt="image12" class="wp-image-3527" src="/static/2024/04/image-17.png" /></a></div>
<p>Some of those overlapping circles should probably be combined (and made even larger!): they represent cameras with very slightly different locations that are examining traffic traveling in both directions; or stretches where mobile cameras have been moved up and down the road by small increments. Still, this is enough to be interesting.</p>
<p>Say, where were those DCPC study &quot;outlier tracts&quot; again?</p>
<div class="float wp-block-image aligncenter size-full docutils container">
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="/static/2024/04/image-18.png"><img alt="image13" class="wp-image-3528" src="/static/2024/04/image-18.png" /></a></div>
<p>Area residents will probably have already mentally categorized the largest pink circles above: they're highways. Along the Potomac, they're the spots where traffic from 395 and 66 enter the city. Along the Anacostia, they trace 295. In ward 5, they trace New York Avenue's route out of the city and toward Route 50, I-95, and the BW Parkway. Other notable spots include an area near RFK Stadium where the roads are wide and empty; the often grade-separated corridor along North Capitol Street; and various locations along the 395 tunnel.</p>
<p>We can look at this analytically using OpenStreetMap data. Speed limit data would be nice, but it's famously spotty in OSM. The next best thing is <em>road class</em>, which is defined by OSM data's &quot;highway&quot; tag. This is the value that determines whether a line in the database gets drawn as a skinny gray alley or a thick red interstate. It's not perfect--it reflects human judgments about how something should be visually represented, not an objective measurement of some underlying quality--but it's not a bad place to start. You can find a complete explanation of the possible values for this tag <a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:highway#Roads">here</a>. I used these six, which are listed from the largest kind of road to the smallest:</p>
<ol></p><li><p>motorway</p>
</li><li><p>trunk</p>
</li><li><p>primary</p>
</li><li><p>secondary</p>
</li><li><p>tertiary</p>
</li><li><p>residential</p>
</li></ol><p>I stopped at &quot;residential&quot; for a reason. As described above, camera locations are snapped to a grid. That snapping means that when we ask PostGIS for the class of the nearest road for each camera location, we'll get back some erroneous data. If you go below the &quot;residential&quot; class you start including alleys, and the misattribution problem becomes overwhelming.</p>
<p>But &quot;residential&quot; captures what we're interested in. When we assign each camera location to a road class, we get the following:</p>
<div class="float wp-block-image aligncenter size-full docutils container">
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="/static/2024/04/image-24.png"><img alt="image14" class="wp-image-3534" src="/static/2024/04/image-24.png" /></a></div>
<p>How does this compare to human-issued speed citation locations? I'm glad you asked:</p>
<div class="float wp-block-image aligncenter size-full docutils container">
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="/static/2024/04/image-26.png"><img alt="image15" class="wp-image-3536" src="/static/2024/04/image-26.png" /></a></div>
<p>The delta between these tells the tale:</p>
<div class="float wp-block-image aligncenter size-full docutils container">
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="/static/2024/04/image-27.png"><img alt="image16" class="wp-image-3537" src="/static/2024/04/image-27.png" /></a></div>
<p>ATE is disproportionately deployed on big, fast roads. And although OSM speed limit coverage isn't great, the data we do have further validates this, showing that ATE citation locations have an average&nbsp;<tt class="docutils literal">maxspeed</tt>&nbsp;of 33.2 mph versus 27.9 for human citations.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that this is for citation <em>locations</em>. When we look at citations per location it becomes even more obvious that road class is overwhelmingly important.</p>
<div class="float wp-block-image aligncenter size-full docutils container">
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="/static/2024/04/image-28.png"><img alt="image17" class="wp-image-3538" src="/static/2024/04/image-28.png" /></a></div>
<p>ATE is disproportionately deployed on big, fast roads. And ATE cameras deployed on big, fast roads generate disproportionately large numbers of citations.</p>
<p>But also: big, fast roads disproportionately carry non-local traffic. <strong>This brings into question the entire idea of analyzing ATE equity impact by examining camera-adjacent populations.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="stuff-that-didn-t-work">
<h2>Stuff that didn't work</h2>
<p>None of this is how I began my analysis. My initial plan was considerably fancier. I created a sample of human speed enforcement locations and ATE enforcement locations and constructed some independent variables to accompany each: the nearby Black population percentage; the number of crashes (of varying severity) in that location in the preceding six months; the distance to one of DC's officially-designated <a class="reference external" href="https://dcgis.maps.arcgis.com/apps/instant/media/index.html?appid=163f543d068340bc8c2b420030130c2b">injury corridors</a>. The idea was to build a logit classifier, then look at the coefficients associated with each IV to determine their relative importance in predicting whether a location was an example of human or ATE speed enforcement.</p>
<div class="float wp-block-image aligncenter size-full docutils container">
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="/static/2024/04/image-23.png"><img alt="image18" class="wp-image-3533" src="/static/2024/04/image-23.png" /></a></div>
<p>But it didn't work! My confusion matrix was badly befuddled; my ROC curve AUC was a dismal 0.57 (0.5 means your classifier is as good as a coin flip). I couldn't find evidence that those variables are what determine ATE placement.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-truth-is-boring">
<h2>The truth is boring</h2>
<p>Traffic cameras get put on big, fast roads where they generate a ton of citations. Score one for the braindead ATE revenue truthers, I guess?</p>
<p>It is true that those big, fast roads are disproportionately in the city's Black neighborhoods. It's perfectly legitimate to point out the ways that highway placement and settlement patterns reflect past and present racial inequities--<a class="reference external" href="https://encyclopediavirginia.org/white-mans-road-thru-black-mans-home/">DC is a historically significant exemplar of it, in fact</a>. But ATE placement is occurring in the context of that legacy, not causing it.</p>
<p>Besides, it's not even clear that the drivers on those highways are themselves disproportionately Black. That's a question worth asking, but neither I nor the DCPC study have the data necessary to answer it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-uncanny-efficacy-of-equity-arguments">
<h2>The Uncanny Efficacy of Equity Arguments</h2>
<p>Before we leave this topic behind entirely, I want to briefly return to the idea of cognitive dissonance and its role in producing studies and narratives like the one I've just spent so many words and graphs trying to talk you out of.</p>
<p>The amazing thing about <strong>actually, that thing is racist</strong> content is that it attracts both people who dislike <strong>that thing</strong> and want to resolve dissonance by having their antipathy validated; AND people who like the <strong>thing</strong>. Arguably, it's more effective on that second group, because it introduces dissonance that they will be unable to resolve unless they engage with the argument. It's such a powerful effect that I knew it was happening to me the entire time I was writing this! And yet I kept typing!</p>
<p>I think it's rare for this strategy to be pursued cynically, or even deliberately. But it is an evolutionarily successful tactic for competing in an ever-more-intense attention economy. And the 2018 DCPC study debuted just as it was achieving takeoff in scholarly contexts:</p>
<div class="float wp-block-image aligncenter size-full docutils container">
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="/static/2024/04/image-1.png"><img alt="image19" class="wp-image-3511" src="/static/2024/04/image-1.png" /></a></div>
<p>None of this is to say that racism isn't real or important. Of course it is! That's why the tactic works. But that fact is relatively disconnected from the efficacy of the rhetorical tactic, which can often be used to pump around attention (and small amounts of money) by applying and removing dissonance regardless of whether or not there's an underlying inequity--and without doing anything to resolve the inequity when it's truly present.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="speed-cameras-are-good-stop-worrying-about-it">
<h2>Speed cameras are good, stop worrying about it</h2>
<p>Speeding kills and maims people.</p>
<p>Speed cameras discourage speeding.</p>
<p>Getting tickets sucks, nobody's a perfect driver, but ATE cameras in DC don't cite you unless you're going 10 mph over the limit. It's truly not asking that much.</p>
<p>Please drive safely. And please don't waste your energy feeling guilty about insisting that our neighbors drive safely, too.</p>

<p><a class="reference external" href="https://ggwash.org/view/92933/permit-renewal-for-eckington-asphalt-plant-raises-questions-about-air-quality-health">https://ggwash.org/view/92933/permit-renewal-for-eckington-asphalt-plant-raises-questions-about-air-quality-health</a></p>
<p>I am both amused and conflicted about being an agent by which such NIMBY sentiment penetrates the region's best YIMBY site. I wrote the analysis mostly to put out my shingle as a geo guy, not out of heartfelt hatred for this plant. Sometimes it's hard to account for this last decade, you know? I know Postgis, I swear. I can load Census data for you and tell you stuff about it. It's all true.</p>
<p>But it turned out that this plant is legitimately weird, situated in an area that's about forty times as dense as is typical for this kind of facility. Look at that: I radicalized myself.</p>
<p>The actual permit renewal is not going to get rid of the plant, the indignant shock of the folks on the community meeting Zoom notwithstanding. But the neighbors are plenty mad and if Fort Myer Construction Corporation has any sense at all they're thinking hard about how to maximize this rapidly depreciating asset's value before some underemployed lawyer in the neighborhood starts giving them real trouble. I'm happy enough to have stoked that fire with some numbers and Javascript.</p>

                    <p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.thecut.com/article/erewhon-smoothie-boston-los-angeles-history.html">Kerry Howley's latest is unsurprisingly great, detailing the history behind a trendy LA health food store</a> that somehow, as a middle-aged dad on the east coast, I had never heard of. I think you should go read it!</p>
<p>OK.</p>
<p>If you remembered this tab, great. Here's what I want to add: this brought back a lot of memories, and not just fond ones of being (what I hope was) gently mean toward Californians.</p>
<p>My family's own nutritional choices were idiosyncratic by the standards of my peers, but not wildly so. At my mother's urging we avoided red meat and favored brown rice. Though come to think of it, how were we supposed to count wild rice mix count? Hard to say. I imagine it harvested in dugout canoes by elders with lined faces and rough-woven shawls, who beat the grains free of their stalks with sticks bearing cultural significances that I am not entitled to contemplate. It seems implausible that this could have a high glycemic index.</p>
<p>My mom's dietary hunches were absorbed from her friend B. B was a character, and I am delighted and a little surprised to see that she is still alive. I'll avoid linking to it, but she keeps her yoga instructor resume up to date even now.</p>
<p>My mother would take us to visit B at her house on Lake Barcroft, where she lived semi-tempestuously with occasional deadbeat boyfriends and her parents, two friendly but deteriorating 1950s paragons who seemed like they probably once knew their way around a cocktail shaker. We would sit on the dock, or take a little sailboat out on the algae-choked lake (chemical lawn fertilizers' fault, we were assured). One time I got bitten by a goose.</p>
<p>B would explain how it was wrong to smack mosquitoes (just relax and let them bite you), why we must never eat onions or garlic, how being deliberate about which nostril we breathed through could help us regulate our body temperature. When she babysat, Bonnie made us chant Om. She undertook idealistic projects: canvassing for SANE/FREEZE, doing volunteer work at American Indian reservations, removing the gutters from her house to improve the aesthetics. These ended with approximately similar results. Once or twice she convinced my mother to bring us to a weekend at an ashram, where I ate bland food, ignored the yoga classes, and briefly swam in a pool filled with green water that was shockingly cold and opaque. I spent these weekends devouring sci-fi novels from my bunk in a rapidly blackening mood.</p>
<p>In retrospect, I'm grateful to have been exposed to ideas this intense and silly at such a young age, because it prepared me to begin noticing when people besides B had them. Including myself.</p>
<p>Surely we have all declared our exasperation with diet fads, but this just means we're tired of hearing them, not that we intend to stop producing them ourselves. I have relatives who count their renunciation of gluten as a turning point in their lives. Others who swear by the health benefits of drinking only red wine, not white. My immediate family's dietary limits are a labyrinth of genuine anaphylactic response and intense personal preferences, from which I mostly abstain.</p>
<p>But I do occasionally indulge my own weeks-long dietary impulses. I am currently taking enormous amounts of Taurine, for instance, a non-essential amino acid, though if you ask me this categorization badly undersells it. This idea arrived with just the sort of trappings I enjoy: <a class="reference external" href="/wp-admin/post.php?post=3481&amp;action=edit#:~:text=air%20of%20science-,normally%2Dskeptical%20outlet,(opens%20in%20a%20new%20tab),-science.org/content">blogged(!) by an impeccably-credentialed author whose soberminded scientific musings</a> I've read for over a decade. There are studies! Who would have thought! A perfectly nondescript white powder, packed into tidy capsules, allegedly already present in your body. You just need more of it, much more, and of course it's Prime eligible. A perfect supplement for the supplement skeptic. It even comes with a fun anecdote about starving cats and the global chemical industry that you can use, if you find that sort of thing fun, which I do. I have been eating grams of it every day.</p>
<p>I had a hard time relating to B. I never understood why this white lady from Alexandria had framed pictures of of blue-skinned Indian gods all over her shag-carpeted basement. But I suspect that my pill-eating might be motivated by something we have in common. When considering whether onions are bad, or whether eating almonds can be justified on the basis of her <em>vata dosha</em>, B's aesthetics pushed her toward explanations full of ancient divine warriors and quests to rebalance the cosmos. These rationales never appealed to me (unless you count the snack food ads in Marvel Comics, which I suppose you probably should). But that doesn't mean they were any less post-hoc than my own.</p>
<p>Eating is pretty weird. At the risk of stating the obvious: we are very complicated chemical reactions that bubble along for the better part of a century, sustained by shoveling gunk inside of ourselves to rot. Horrifying. And a microgram of the wrong thing can bring it all to a stop! Figuring out what gunk to shovel and when is an overwhelmingly urgent biological question, but also such a constant one that it can be guaranteed scarcely more conscious thought than whether or not to take another breath. Consider the quantity of art, institutions, and baroque cultural plumbing we have invented to modulate the process of mating. Is there any reason to think that the natural world has allocated less evolutionary complexity to the problem of eating? It's practically in the basement of our hierarchy of needs. It is the first deliberate act we must perform, and often the last pleasure we are able to enjoy. Solipsistically, there is almost nothing more important. Yet we can't stop to build a Taj Mahal every time we feel snacky. We have to get on with things. The significance and complexity of the act are ignored, concealed. Subterranean.</p>
<p>If you don't give the immune system enough to do <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene_hypothesis#:~:text=In%20medicine%2C%20the%20hygiene%20hypothesis,by%20strengthening%20the%20immune%20system.">it will come up with ways to stay busy</a>, and I think this is approximately true for our other wildly complicated subsystems. If you tallied them all up, which do you think would have more rules and ideas: diet books, or the Protestant Reformation?</p>
<p>Exposure to ideas doesn't always help you pick the right ones, but it can teach you what extremism looks like. Besides, at some point in my life I realized that being a picky eater was boring, and that I didn't dislike any food as much as I disliked making the person offering it feel unappreciated. Put a dish in front of me and I will eat it. I can pretty much promise you that. I can't promise not to have ideas about it--sometimes wild ones. But I will at least endeavor to remind myself that those ideas are probably ridiculous.</p>
<p>This is the equilibrium I've arrived at. It might be unreasonable to expect everyone to make the same set of commitments. I suppose I'll have to leave it at that. I'm already quite behind on today's Taurine allotment.</p>

                    <p>Adding a third kid hasn't made anything easier, but we are getting a little more done. Perhaps it's the first two maturing. Perhaps it's the lack of a <a class="reference external" href="/2022/10/31/the-house-of-endless-mourning-feat-the-harlem-globetrotters/">big seasonal project</a>. Or perhaps my capacity for parental neglect is just being inexorably stretched. But in 2023 I managed to put up the most Halloween decorations in recent memory.</p>
<p>The crawlspace under the house remains absolutely choked with them, row after row of waterproof crates filled with slumbering skeletons and black styrofoam cats. Retrieving them isn't much fun--&quot;crawl&quot; isn't a euphemism here, and this expanse of cluttered and rough concrete is an ideal spot for neighborhood animals to conceal their various awful biological compulsions--but it's always a pleasure to crack those boxes open and rediscover the spooky treasures I've amassed over the years. No smoke machines this time, and I didn't collect the coffin or animatronics from Kriston's place (the Halloween Annex). Too scary for kids! But our kitchen is currently festooned with fake cauldrons and the basement is bathed in black light. Not bad. It made for a pretty good kiddo party.</p>
<p>Besides that, I've mostly been celebrating by reading a few spooky stories, with mixed results. <a class="reference external" href="https://archive.org/details/famousmodernghos00scar/page/n25/mode/2up">This volume of ghost stories</a> was easy to find on the Internet Archive, and got off to a bang with <em>The Willows</em>, which I hadn't read but instantly demonstrated why it's considered seminal. Does it get too many bonus points for a tidy structural trick at the end? Maybe, but when you consider its relatively early place in the genre and influence on Lovecraft, its impact has to be rated pretty highly indeed.</p>
<p>Other entries have been more underwhelming. <em>Shadows on the Wall</em> amounted to nothing, <em>The Messenger</em> ended far too happily, and <em>The Beast With Five Fingers</em> had some fun stuff--harried pursuit of unraveling protagonists, inexplicable menace--but was ultimately prosaic. <em>Lazarus</em> wins points for its distinctively Russian depressiveness, and perhaps for introducing the BUT SOMETHING CAME BACK WITH HIM trope, but it's not actually interested in being a ghost story. But it did remind me I need to reread <em>The Great God Pan</em>, which was an inappropriate summertime selection earlier in the year, and quite effective in its evocation of prudish occult disgust, but suffered from me being too sleepy while reading to carefully track its somewhat twistingly episodic plot.</p>
<p>But let's finish with an even more well-trodden recommendation: I'm revisiting <em>The Turn of the Screw</em> and maybe, finally, appreciating Henry James' subtlety and the interiority of his narrators. I think I was probably too eager to get to the ghosts the first time through. And frankly, I don't remember any ghosts at all in <em>The Bostonians</em> or <em>The Golden Bowl</em>. Inexcusable. But I'm starting to think this guy might have some talent despite that poor judgment.</p>

                    <p>I am a much worse reader than I used to be. Kids and prestige TV (but mostly kids) mean I can barely keep up with my monthly sci-fi book club. That's okay: I long ago reconciled myself to being a not-particularly-fast reader. And maybe some day I'll have more time.</p>
<p>But this limited intake (and social mechanism committing me to finishing these books) means that the cost of getting stuck with a bad book feels high. And our club has been getting stuck with a lot of bad books. In particular, the recently published books we select are often surprisingly poor. It seems like this trend has been getting worse.</p>
<p>There are a few ways this could be in my head. Book club is a social experience, and it's more fun to criticize a book than to blandly celebrate it. And the books we select from past years also benefit from additional filtering: the nature of culture means that recent books get discussed more than old books, so if an older book rises to our attention it must have been pretty good.</p>
<p>Still, as a reader it's hard to escape the sense that something is badly awry in how fiction gets published and makes it into the reviewer ecosystem. I frequently finish a book, thinking it was not particularly good, then <a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/4989865?ref=nav_mybooks">dutifully file my review on Goodreads</a> only to find it surrounded by a bunch of effusive 5-star ratings from people who should know better. De gustibus and all that. But something feels amiss.</p>
<p>I think there there are several things going on here. What follows is just hunches based on reading a bunch of mediocre novels and paying close attention to their Acknowledgements sections. I don't have any connection to the industry. So maybe I have all this wrong. But it's the kind of stuff that people in the industry would have good reasons to avoid saying. So I'm going to bet on my naivete as a competitive advantage.</p>
<div class="section" id="don-t-yuck-someone-else-s-yum">
<h2>Don't Yuck Someone Else's Yum</h2>
<p>The most effusive reviewers are also the most prolific. They've got little badges next to their names declaring them to be the top Goodreads reviewer in Wales, or whatever. They link out to their book-related podcasts and Youtube channels. They are bookfluencers, or aspiring authors themselves (more on this below). They are building an audience, and you know what audiences don't like? Being told that something they love is bad. This is a fundamental truth about people that I badly wish I could convey to my irascible adolescent self. It's why every pop culture podcast you've ever listened to has only good things to say about that TV show you're watching. It's why nobody runs negative reviews anymore, except as an occasional try for virality. It's why movie critics swallow their grumbling and publish hundreds of words about whatever redeeming qualities they can identify in <em>Ant Man</em>. This is an inescapable consequence of our unbundled Darwinian media ecosystem, and it's mostly fine, but it means that published criticism is very different, vastly more forgiving, and considerably less useful than my outdated mindset expects.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="pick-authors-for-criteria-that-matter-so-not-quality">
<h2>Pick Authors for Criteria that Matter (So: Not Quality)</h2>
<p>It's famously hard to identify hits in entertainment. Nobody with any taste thinks the most commercially successful books have the most artistic merit. And the new media environment weakens sophisticated gatekeepers' power to anoint winners. Plus there are way, way, <em>way</em> more plausibly-competent aspiring authors out there than the industry needs to keep shelves stocked. So why should anyone bother trying to find the best books? It's not like the audience can be counted on to tell the difference. So why not use a criterion that makes more sense? It works for radio programmers, after all.</p>
<p>There are several approaches that suggest themselves. Publishers can pick someone who already has an audience to bring along, like the YouTuber whose middling sci-fi debut we read. Or someone who'll be helpful to them in other ways, like the author who happened to quietly also be Time Magazine's book critic. Or the author who, along with their partner, ran a wildly influential sci-fi blog. In all of these cases we picked the book based on the press attention it got, then learned the alternate industry rationale later. And in all of these cases--okay, nearly all--the book was unimpressive but basically fine. Maybe these authors' success in other domains simply speaks to their overall intelligence and commitment to their chosen genre milieu! I think that's plausible.</p>
<p>But these filtering mechanisms are different than the (also deeply imperfect!) ones that the genre formerly used, and while they have their merits, they don't seem to suit me as well as the old ones. An author's social capabilities seem to be more important to whether their work gets attention than ever before. I think this is why my genre fiction author friend's anecdotes about trading book blurbs are so depressing. I think it's why YA authors all behave like psychopaths toward each other. The people who rise to the top of this environment have to produce work that meets a minimum threshold for quality. But beyond that, other considerations seem to be the ones that matter most.</p>

<div class="section" id="there-s-no-money-in-books-so-book-authors-should-try-to-write-something-else">
<h2>There's No Money In Books So Book Authors Should Try To Write Something Else</h2>
<p>Publishing is a mug's game: <a class="reference external" href="https://ideas.bkconnection.com/10-awful-truths-about-publishing#:~:text=Thus%2C%20the%20average%20book%20published,in%20the%20US%20retail%20channels.">a small number of hard-to-predict breakout hits earn money</a>, and everything else loses it. But even the hits produce paltry returns compared to other forms of entertainment. So if you're lucky and talented enough to write one of those hits, your first order of business seems to be getting your work optioned for film or TV. One particularly audacious author we read ended his rote sci-fi action thriller, which hewed to every screenwriting formula you could imagine, by thanking the agent that represents him for those other transactions. Perhaps most depressing to me was N.K. Jemisin's newest series. Unlike the others mentioned in this post, I think being a three-time Hugo winner and possessed of enormous actual talent is enough for me to risk being gently mean by naming her. But <em>The City We Became</em> is an obviously calculated mix of cliched action setpieces and derivative provincial fanservice. It is cinematic in the worst way. But most people haven't noticed, and <a class="reference external" href="https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/nk-jemisin-the-city-we-became-series-adaptation-walden-media-1235522776/">it's on its way to the screen</a>. Oh well. <em>Broken Earth</em> was great and I'm glad to see its creator get paid.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="is-it-hopeless">
<h2>Is it hopeless?</h2>
<p>Basically: yes. But not completely. Our club winds up reading a bunch of books that come out of writers' workshops and MFA programs; or books by self-consciously literary authors who stray over to genre. These aren't sure bets either (I understand our writerly training systems' focus on short stories, but think it could stand some interrogation). But they do represent filtering systems that are at least more connected to the work. I don't doubt that the people running those systems care about craft.</p>
<p>Amazing stuff still gets published, still gets attention, still makes its way into our monthly meeting. But goodness is it nestled amidst a lot of forgettable trash.</p>

                    <p>I didn't dig far into the surrounding context when I wrote about <a class="reference external" href="/2023/02/03/fake-tags-are-a-real-problem/">buying fake tags</a>, but I saw plenty of surprised reactions on social media to this obvious criminality on Facebook Marketplace. The situation is well understood, but pretty far from resolved.</p>
<p>I recommend these articles from CNBC and NBC News:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/17/the-fight-against-stolen-products-on-amazon-and-facebook-marketplace.html">Stolen goods sold on Amazon, eBay and Facebook are causing havoc for major retailers</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/crime-courts/organized-shoplifting-rings-work-police-one-ohio-town-are-fighting-bac-rcna9802">'It’s an easy fast dollar': How organized retail theft rings in one Ohio town use Facebook Marketplace to sell stolen goods</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The second story highlights law enforcement's sense that of the various online marketplaces, Facebook is particularly unhelpful when they make a request.</p>
<p>There's also relevant legislation: <a class="reference external" href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/936">the INFORM Act</a> would require sellers who are doing meaningful volumes of business to pass through additional identity verification processes. It passed the House, but I'm unsure whether anyone considers it a priority in the new Congress. <a class="reference external" href="https://rilastagemedia.blob.core.windows.net/rila-web/rila.web/media/media/pdfs/letters%20to%20hill/2021/ceo-inform-consumers-act-final1.pdf">Retail industry groups are pushing for it</a>, though, with the online marketplaces standing on the other side of the issue.</p>
<p>This wouldn't be a panacea. As the NBC story notes, theft rings recruit can still legitimate front-people to go through verification processes. And for something like fake tags, it seems like sellers could easily set up a new account whenever they approach INFORM's $5,000 revenue threshold for verification. Still, it's a step in the right direction, as is <a class="reference external" href="https://illinoisattorneygeneral.gov/pressroom/2021_12/20211203.html">the multi-state task force convened by attorneys general who are interested in this problem</a>.</p>
<p>Lots more to be done here, but some people are paying attention. Whether that includes anyone in D.C., I couldn't say...</p>

                    <p>As a bicyclist I am always ready to believe the worst about drivers. Drivers are why I'm woken up by gunning engines in the middle of the night. Drivers are why I have titanium screwed into my collarbone. Drivers! That I bring my children to school by bicycle every weekday morning has only raised the stakes and, along with it, my ire.</p>
<div class="float wp-block-image size-large docutils container">
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="/static/2023/02/image.png"><img alt="image1" class="wp-image-3399" src="/static/2023/02/image-1024x447.png" /></a></div>
<p>Despite this, I have been immersed in enough safe streets rhetoric to be convinced that making our streets less deadly is about how we build, not who we blame. Incompetence and inattention are inevitable human foibles. We know drivers will make mistakes and it is more productive to ameliorate those mistakes' effects than to obsess over how we will punish them.</p>
<p>I buy this, with one exception. I get angry at drivers who do not try. The ones who don't accept that they have a responsibility to others and that they consequently must make an effort. The ones who selfishly exempt themselves from the rules. The ones who choose lawlessness. I get very angry at them.</p>
<p>And recent years have provided a new signal that such a driver is near: the fake temporary tag. All of a sudden, it seemed, paper tags were everywhere. Often they were on credible-seeming vehicles--ones that looked new, or at least newly washed. But sometimes the expiration date had passed. And as the months wore on, they started showing up on increasingly-implausible beaters.</p>
<div class="float wp-block-image size-large docutils container">
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="/static/2023/02/image-1.png"><img alt="image2" class="wp-image-3400" src="/static/2023/02/image-1-1024x1000.png" /></a></div>
<p>These days it's obvious: fake tags are part of the scofflaw trinity, along with <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/defacedplateNYC">defaced plates</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.amazon.com/license-plate-camera-blocker/s?k=license+plate+camera+blocker">opaque plate covers</a>.</p>
<p>The reason this trend started is equally obvious: automated traffic enforcement, or ATE. <a class="reference external" href="https://lims.dccouncil.gov/downloads/LIMS/51300/Introduction/RC24-0222-Introduction.pdf">Speed cameras annually collect more than $100 million in fines from area drivers</a>. And that's just D.C.'s cameras! Compared to the era that preceded them, these systems have made enforcement of traffic laws shockingly consistent. They have made a difference for road safety, too, as even AAA--a reliably brash proponent of motorists' most chauvinistic impulses--has <a class="reference external" href="https://cluballiance.aaa.com/public-affairs/press-release?rdl=midatlantic.aaa.com&amp;Id=6d0b4879-5fa1-46f8-bf47-3f3a41658e15">grudgingly admitted</a>.</p>
<p>The relative scale of automated enforcement is immense. Enforcement of traffic laws by humans is, by comparison, so constrained as to be irrelevant. ATE dramatically increases the frequency with which drivers are punished.</p>
<div class="float wp-block-image size-large docutils container">
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="/static/2023/02/image-2.png"><img alt="image3" class="wp-image-3401" src="/static/2023/02/image-2-1024x624.png" /></a></div>
<p>ATE transformed citations from an occasional episode of motorist misfortune--not so different from a flat tire--to a persistent nuisance. But ATE systems work by connecting a license plate back to a driver. Sever that connection and the citation will never find its target. Some drivers have realized this and taken steps to end the frustration that ATE causes them.</p>
<p>I think this is easy to understand. Spend any time near D.C. roads, and it's easy to see, too. But why isn't anyone doing anything about it?</p>
<div class="section" id="dc-has-given-up">
<h2>DC Has Given Up</h2>
<p>The city convened a task force about fake tags, which did a study, and then <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/JWPascale/status/1577728254013837336">decided not to do anything</a>. Why?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although the Task Force convened to determine options available to move forward, with the assistance of the Mayor's Office of Racial Equity, it was ultimately determined not to move forward with many of the initial ideas due to the possible negative impact on people of color. Therefore, law enforcement continues to enforce fake temporary tags using their existing processes.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>This might sound bizarre, but it actually makes a sad kind of sense. <a class="reference external" href="https://www.washingtoninformer.com/traffic-cameras-more-prevalent-in-black-d-c-neighborhoods/">D.C.'s traffic cameras are more prevalent in Black neighborhoods</a>.</p>

<p>That's because <a class="reference external" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/transportation/2022/02/23/dc-traffic-deaths-highest-record/">those neighborhoods have the most dangerous streets</a>. Walkable neighborhoods are desirable, so they're expensive, so they're for the rich. <a class="reference external" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/washington_area_spark/49430315197">Poor neighborhoods are where you put freeways</a>. The people living in Wards 7 and 8 are stuck with an auto-focused streetscape, and so of course they reconcile themselves to it. It is understandable that they find it deeply annoying when aging hipster bike enthusiasts characterize this as a kind of false consciousness during controversies like the one over <a class="reference external" href="https://ggwash.org/view/76669/how-the-9th-street-bikeway-became-a-debate-over-religion-and-race">the 9th Street bike lane</a>. But it is nevertheless true that in D.C. the residents of our poorest wards, who are disproportionately people of color, are often both cars' staunchest boosters and most deeply suffering victims.</p>
<p>The pandemic may have helped normalize the use of fake tags. <a class="reference external" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/dmvs-backlogged-pandemic/2020/11/14/cb86320a-204b-11eb-90dd-abd0f7086a91_story.html">The Department of Motor Vehicles got backlogged, which led to forbearance for offenses like having invalid tags</a>. It's unreasonable to punish someone if the city has made compliance impossible, after all. This led to a multi-year period during which the likelihood of being punished for using fake tags dropped, which can't have hurt their popularity.</p>
<p>Looking at tag-related citations as a percent of each MPD district's total citations provides a suggestive window onto the issue's priority in different parts of the city:</p>
<div class="float wp-block-image size-large docutils container">
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="/static/2023/02/image-4.png"><img alt="image5" class="wp-image-3403" src="/static/2023/02/image-4-1024x434.png" /></a></div>
<p>I can think of at least two distasteful explanations for the pattern in this graph. Either the use of fake tags spread across the city after an initial concentration in the Seventh District, flattening its local priority; or reduced enforcement during the pandemic normalized the use of fake tags to such an extent that the previous level of vigor applied to the problem by MPD in the Seventh became untenable. It's one thing to hassle young men in fast cars over something; when everyone's doing it, enforcement gets more complicated. There are other possibilities, of course (maybe a district commander who hates fake tags as much as me retired because of COVID?). But I think normalization is a plausible reading.</p>
<p>I think that partly because <a class="reference external" href="https://thedcline.org/2021/05/14/press-release-councilmember-mcduffie-introduces-clean-hands-equity-legislation-to-reduce-barriers-for-obtaining-licenses-and-permits/">the city seems to be losing its will to punish bad drivers in general</a> (with notable help from the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/01/06/dc-clean-hands-licenses-court-order/">courts</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.acludc.org/en/legislation/aclu-dc-testifies-dc-council-bill-24-237-clean-hands-law">activists</a>). It's hard not to feel like we've decided that it's no longer worth trying to correct this class of misbehavior. Driving is too important to punish people for doing it dangerously.</p>

<p>The D.C. DMV has <a class="reference external" href="https://dmv.dc.gov/service/temporary-registration-and-tags%E2%80%94individual">stopped issuing long-lived paper tags</a>, at least. I guess that's something. But it hasn't made any difference, as a quick look at Facebook Marketplace demonstrates.</p>

<p>(An aside: hanging around D.C. bike circles left me unsurprised to see illegal activity on Facebook Marketplace--it's the go-to venue for bike thieves these days--but having finally looked closer, the level of obvious criminality is genuinely jaw-dropping. <a class="reference external" href="https://www.facebook.com/marketplace/item/1338509433615647/?ref=product_details&amp;referral_code=marketplace_top_picks&amp;referral_story_type=top_picks">Here's someone with a garage full of ten-gallon buckets of Tide, Downy, and Gain, offering home delivery</a>!

</ul>
<p>Prices ranged from $25-65, and most offered tags for 60 days, though there are some 30- and 90-day options as well. The reuse of titles and illustrations (I'm particularly fond of the stock photo of a DMV building) suggests that some individual tag entrepreneurs might be behind multiple listings. But why would they list multiple prices? That will have to remain an SEO mystery for another day. <a class="reference external" href="https://www.popville.com/tag/stolen-wheels/">The inclusion of wheels as an offering also merits attention, given the current popularity of wheel theft</a>. But let's try to stay focused.</p>
<p>I decided to take one of these services for a spin. All of them are tied to transparently fake Facebook accounts, which makes it hard to choose. I decided to randomly select one of the listings <em>not</em> associated with the profile of an implausibly buxom woman (I was risking enough trouble already) and see if I couldn't do business. &quot;Jorge&quot; was very helpful but alas, not as ready to incriminate himself as I would've liked. Otherwise, five stars. Shoutout to <a class="reference external" href="https://vingenerator.org/">vingenerator.org too</a>, by the way.</p>

<h2>fake tags matter</h2>
<p>If you have read this far, you're probably starting to worry that I'm crazy. I spent $55 just to make myself mad! I admit that it's at least a little nuts.</p>
<p>But I think this stuff matters. A driver who believes they are entitled to exempt themselves from responsibility portends bad things. They might drive more recklessly. They might not carry insurance. They might ruin someone's life.</p>
<p>I think D.C., Virginia, and Maryland should look at this problem again. I think they should sue Facebook over its failure to police Marketplace. I think they should figure out who owns that CashApp account. And I think they should give drivers with fake tags some good reasons not to use them.</p>
<p>I realize that punishing people, especially vulnerable people, is distasteful. But what I see from city leadership and my fellow citizens suggests they're in denial about the tragedy that comes from cavalier misuse of our roads. It is inexcusable to ask the families who experience those tragedies to pay that price just so that we can avoid facing our own discomfort.</p>

                    <p>For the better part of a decade we've been warned to fear the displaced truck drivers that will soon be set adrift by autonomous semis. Suddenly that looks wrong. You can find self-driving projects in the &quot;losses&quot; section of various companies' financial statements and in a handful of sunbelt cities. But that's about it. Meanwhile, ChatGPT's serviceable prose is everywhere! What does this mean for the white collar worker? A representative riff came <a class="reference external" href="https://jabberwocking.com/chatgpt-goes-to-law-school/">from Kevin Drum this week</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
[M]y guess is that GPT v5.0 or v6.0 (we're currently at v3.5) will be able to take over the business of writing briefs and so forth with only minimal supervision. After that, it only takes one firm to figure out that all the partners can get even richer if they turn over most of the work of associates to a computer. Soon everyone will follow. Then the price of legal advice will plummet, too, at all but the very highest levels.</blockquote>
<p>I agree that language models are going to have important effects on knowledge workers. But Drum reasons about this by comparing human- and machine-authored documents' quality. I don’t think that tells the whole story. A document's function and value depends not only on its content but its context, and inhuman authors aren’t going to be able to satisfy our contextual needs.</p>
<p>Consider these questions:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Why does the pace of production for things like books, TV shows, and pop music continue to increase when the catalog of excellent older works is already too large to ever be consumed?</li>
<li>Why do business executives spend their enormously expensive time writing planning documents that will only be read by a small set of c-suite executives when cheaper and better prose could be purchased from a professional writer?</li>
<li>Why do you need a lawyer to draft a will, a trust, or other common legal documents?</li>
</ul>
<p>It wasn't until I watched some close friends start a successful news site that I really started to think about these questions. It was the 2010s, and not only was I interested in my friends' success, but the cultural moment suddenly cast journalism in a stark new light. The internet made global distribution the default. Digital metrics made it easy to see what parts of the news bundle were generating value. The bundle was quickly pulled apart, and an era of pitiless optimization began.</p>
<p>The adaptations that succeeded in this tumult were shocking. Headlines became confrontational. Content began to focus on moral questions that either flattered or impugned their audience, often based on the reader's membership in groups they couldn't easily change. Old theories about why people sought out news--&quot;to be informed&quot;; &quot;for entertainment&quot;--started to look pretty suspect. These stories did not have much value for guiding behavior in daily life--at best, they helped solidify some existing social norms. And a lot of them seemed to make people feel mad, guilty, or smug. If this was entertainment, it was a pretty strange kind.</p>
<p>A different model fit the facts better: news consumption (and subsequent sharing) was about identity. Readers were building, transmitting, and asserting their identity by deciding what to read and how they felt about it. It was a kind of self-expression via consumption. In doing so they sorted themselves within a moral landscape defined by authors and other readers. Group membership was important, but metagroup membership--how you judged the correctness of the sub-hierarchy--was maybe more so. From there the logic of factionalism in a zero-sum system took over and every dimension of opinion and preference got collapsed into the overdetermined mush of the dominant coalitions. Before you knew it truck ownership had a moral valence.</p>
<p>Aligning ourselves within social systems is something humans like and badly need to do. It's easy to understand why: this is how we succeed as a species and as individuals. Ultimately, it's how we find a mate and reproduce. We are designed to do it, and we invent tools to let us do it ever-more intensely.</p>
<p>This is why we never stop needing new pop stars, authors, and TV shows. Not because the old ones were inferior or because the payphone on the set of <em>Cheers</em> looks distractingly anachronistic. It's because pop music is about sex, and is consequently best administered by pop stars who we find desirable. It's because novelty is an important ingredient as we reify relationships through gift-giving; or as we clamber through social hierarchies of wealth or fame or cleverness by responding to new inputs rather than simply nodding in agreement with previous generations that yes, <em>Moby Dick</em> and <em>Thriller</em> are really good.</p>
<p>Similarly, my hypothetical executive's so-so .docx is produced the way it is not because of what it contains but because of what it represents: countless hours of meetings, Slacks and phone calls to align the participants in the business unit around a shared understanding of goals, roles, and statuses.</p>
<p>The lawyer's exclusive perch is even easier to explain. Lawyers serve as an interface to our formal system for resolving conflict, and have used their proximity to that machinery to cement their position in the hierarchy--to ensure that when there is a question about who gets to facilitate access to the law, the answer is almost always &quot;lawyers&quot;. Most professions don't have this luxury. Nice work if you can get it.</p>
<p>Not everything in our economy is about these concerns. But a <em>lot</em> of the information products we exchange are fundamentally in service of our impossibly baroque system for managing simian hierarchy. Removing the human underpinnings of that hierarchy will rob many of those products of their salience. They will become uninteresting. No one wants to fuck a computer-generated pop star. Okay, almost no one.</p>
<p>I think we'll probably dream up some over-complicated rationales for why we feel this way. It'd be just like us, wouldn't it? Luddite solidarity. Spiritual mysticism. Endless appeals to safety and quality--we're already having a great time playing <em>gotcha!</em> with bad ChatGPT output. But at root, the whole thing is about people, and figuring out which of them get to satisfy their animal needs, and how much.</p>
<p>None of this is to deny that these technologies will be powerful tools that we humans use to swing between branches of our hierarchy in new and surprising ways. But until the AIs start reading each other's stuff, you're still going to need a monkey attached to the enterprise somewhere. Otherwise what's the point?</p>

                    <p>Forbes has <a class="reference external" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenehrlich/2022/12/13/exclusive-transcript-the-full-testimony-sbf-planned-to-give-to-congress/?sh=79518c6c3c47">SBF's planned testimony before the House Financial Services Committee</a>. Now in Bahamian custody, he won't be giving it; and in the hours leading up to his appearance, it seemed like he was trying to wriggle out of the obligation, anyway. Still, it's interesting to examine this document and try to understand what it's trying to accomplish, if anything.</p>
<p>Congressional testimony usually exists in separate spoken and written forms. Witnesses' oral presentation must fit into tight time limits; written testimony goes into the Congressional Record (and, more relevant in the short term, bitrot-prone committee webpages) and its length is limited only by its audience's tolerance for tedium. Sometimes a witness will deliver the same testimony in both forms, especially if they didn't have much time to prep. But it's also common for the spoken version to be a cut down version that includes the key points they are expected to make--they were invited to be a witness for a reason, after all--and whatever punchy one-liners their institution's comms and development teams thinks will work best for earned media and Giving Tuesday emails.</p>
<p>The above applies to normal hearings, which usually have several witnesses who have been invited by staffers to function like evidence cards in the policy debate tournaments they spent their college years attending. SBF's situation would have been different: he would be there to get yelled at by the committee, not to agree with them. He might have been allowed to ramble at greater length as a result. Or he might not. What unites this kind of oppositional hearing with run-of-the-mill witness panel hearings is their transactional nature. Ever since TV cameras were allowed in hearing rooms, and probably before, it's been important to understand hearings in terms of what everyone is getting out of them: the grandstanding legislators, the NGO executives, the corporate representatives, even the media packaging it all up.</p>
<p>All of this might make the exercise sound cynical, but it's not. It's ceremonial. A wedding is an important part of a marriage, but it's not the process that makes it possible. Mostly, it's a chance to publicly express things that the people involved have quietly worked out beforehand. So, too, with a hearing.</p>
<p>As a final piece of preamble, it's important to remember that SBF did not actually deliver this testimony. The document symbolizes and evokes Congressional testimony and its trappings, but it may or may not resemble the message SBF would have delivered had he sat in front of Congress. That's particularly relevant because this testimony is <em>bad</em>. If it authentically reflects SBF's planned message, then--controlling for it likely being unfinished--it must substantially complicate our sense of his sophistication. If it doesn't, and is instead a calculated (albeit minor) media play to take advantage of a news hook that now only exists as a counterfactual... well, it's still a bit of a head-scratcher.</p>
<p>Start with the &quot;I fucked up&quot; opener. Congress does not like this sort of thing! Perhaps he's just giving up on any hope of engendering sympathy among his nominal audience. That's reasonable enough. But then who is he trying to reach? He's delivered variations on this message in a variety of post-collapse conversations, speaking clearly even over the audible grinding of defense attorney teeth in the audience. It's not going to break news. Is this just to generate a clip for the normies? A charmingly impish loop of beeped-out verbiage for Fox News to replay to the retirees he defrauded?</p>
<p>Maybe. But the rest of the document belies this kind of deliberateness. Who is going to listen to this guy's endless axe-grinding about unfair treatment at the hands of the bankruptcy officials who are now obliged to clean up his mess? It's hard to imagine what outcome he's envisioning, or how airing his grievances in this venue and such exhausting detail could possibly confer an advantage. Does he misunderstand his current reputation? Or what it would take for us to admit John Ray as a replacement villain in this saga?</p>
<p>More promising are his complaints about CZ, head of Binance, the exchange whose actions precipitated the FTX collapse. Painting these events as dirty tricks by a foreign competitor against a US (okay, Anglophone?) national champion has always been the best card in a fundamentally awful hand. It's also has the benefit of being the first explanation that SBF offered. Binance has even been having a well-aligned bad news cycle over the last 24 hours! I suppose being in custody is a pretty good excuse for failing to respond nimbly to that news hook. Still, the CZ stuff here is inexcusably thin. Whether that's because SBF is still dreaming of a renewed Binance bailout or because he's just given up on appeals to xenophobia, I couldn't say.</p>
<p>Either way, this document demonstrates no strategy or discipline. It's not only tactically inept, but fails to organize itself around an achievable goal.</p>
<p>Some of that can be explained if the document was never meant to be used. But with each statement the guy makes, it becomes harder to square SBF's facility at crisis communications with his apparently sophisticated--and certainly successful--pre-crisis comms work. These are different skillsets, but it's still striking. Whether the difference is best attributed to panic, pharmaceuticals, or just bad fundamentals remains a mystery to me.</p>

                    <p>The last big Halloween party I threw happened just before the pandemic. It was a lot of work, they always were. Weeks of dragging decorations across town; building some overly ambitious new one every year; making manic entreaties to generous friends to help put them up, and to strangers to come enjoy them, and to even more selfless friends to come take them down in the next day's harsh morning light. Staying late at the venue in the days before to get the prep done, staying until the end of the party to ensure everything went okay. The last couple of times: to do it all with children. It was a lot, and while I wouldn't say the rise of a globe-spanning deadly contagion was a relief, exactly, it did save me a lot of time, effort, and money in late October.</p>
<p>I do miss it, though, and I always feel enormously flattered when people ask me if I'll be doing it again and tell me how much fun they had. The best is when people say it was like a Halloween party from a movie. Perfect.</p>
<p>Well! It is Halloween still, just barely, which means there is still time for me to hit my self-imposed deadline. I am not throwing a party this year, but I have a different spooky offering for you. It does not involve wild, drunken dancing. But it does represent a lot of work: I wrote a gothic novella.</p>
<p>I have a deep affection for this form, particularly when it's narrated by a hyperlexic wiener who will spend an infinite number of words to convince you that he has a bad feeling about all this. I find that both relatable and extremely funny.</p>
<p>Another thing I love: Scooby Doo. I introduced my kids to the series during the pandemic. The franchise is dedicated to the macabre, but also absolutely refuses to let anyone have a bad time (unless you count having your crooked real estate scheme foiled). And, like gothic horror, it is not only undiminished by formula but thrives on it, building a structure so unshakeable that it would grow to encompass the most inane celebrity cameos imaginable, which I also find extremely funny.</p>
<p>And that's what led me to write this, which I hope you will enjoy.</p>

<p>Published in 1956, the sci-fi epic <em>Aniara</em> is Swedish poet Harry Martinson's best-known work. In 1974, he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature. In 1978, reeling from disgrace, he killed himself with a pair of scissors.</p>
<p>There are several things in the preceding sentences that strike me as noteworthy! So it was surprising to me that I first learned about <em>Aniara</em> a couple of years ago, during the modest press coverage of its 2018 film adaptation. Why wasn't this book more famous?</p>
<p>I would come to learn the answer: <em>Aniara</em> is a fractal tragedy. But at the beginning, I'd only heard the &quot;sci-fi epic poem&quot; part. That was enough for me to foist it on the book club I attend.</p>
<p>This led to a second surprise: <em>Aniara</em> is hard to find. There have been two English translations, but both are out of print. <a class="reference external" href="https://www.amazon.com/Aniara-Epic-Science-Fiction-Poem/dp/1885266634/ref=sr_1_2?crid=O9DTFU2GW4WM&amp;keywords=aniara&amp;qid=1665510269&amp;qu=eyJxc2MiOiIxLjg0IiwicXNhIjoiMS4zMSIsInFzcCI6IjAuNDMifQ%3D%3D&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=Aniara%2Cstripbooks%2C74&amp;sr=1-2#customerReviews">Amazon reviews</a> for the book are full of complaints from people aghast at the $200 price that old paperback copies fetch. Didn't this guy win a Nobel Prize?</p>
<p><em>Aniara</em> can be found with some scrounging through the internet. I eventually pointed my book club at a low-contrast scanned PDF from some adjunct's long-forgotten syllabus. But the situation is not great. Or rather, it hadn't been, until recently: I was delighted to see <a class="reference external" href="https://archive.org/details/aniara">a high quality epub version of the Klass/Sjöberg translation on the Internet Archive</a>. It not only contains the complete text of that edition, but has been constructed with attention to faithfully recreating its print layout. English speakers with e-readers probably aren't going to do better than this.</p>
<p>So why is <em>Aniara</em> worth your time?</p>
<p>The poem tracks an eponymous spaceship which, while en route to Mars, is knocked hopelessly off course. As the ship's few thousand inhabitants plunge further and further toward a star they will never reach, they varyingly grapple with and ignore the inevitability of their doom; struggle to distract themselves with frolics, cults, art, sex, and violence; and receive the news that the Earth itself has been destroyed.</p>
<p>The translators pulled off a feat: Martinson uses rhyme--unfashionable for his era--and invented vocabulary that can be both funny and evocative. I can't read Swedish, and so am inadequately equipped to appreciate Klass and Sjöberg’s achievement. But what came out of their collaboration is striking and, I think, quite moving.</p>
<p><em>Aniara</em> anticipates many other nuclear age ecological parables, but Martinson is mostly interested in art, modernity, grief, and alienation. He is a mysterian and a romantic. Why can't the occupants of <em>Aniara</em> find meaning amongst themselves? Why is the memory of the lost Earth such an unhealable wound? This is for the reader to decide. But it's worth noting that <a class="reference external" href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00332828.2021.1882257">Martinson and his sisters were abandoned by his mother a few years after his abusive father's death</a>. He was just six years old. He was nearly fifty when he began writing <em>Aniara</em>, a poem about struggling onward after an unfathomable loss.</p>
<p>In the moment he wrote it, Martinson offered at least a partial balm--one that gives the work an unexpected modern resonance. Our narrator is the mimarobe, a technician responsible for maintaining the Mima, a living instrument aboard <em>Aniara</em>. Mima, through operations not fully understood, absorbs signals from the distant reaches of the universe and synthesizes them into glimpses of unattainable sights that are mysterious and spiritually nourishing. It is the Mima's eventual malfunction and destruction that makes the circumstances of <em>Aniara</em>'s inhabitants truly unbearable.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/40916304">Critics seem to agree that Mima is Martinson's stand-in for art</a>. That makes sense to me. But it's not the only idea that presents itself. I have spent the past months reading about AI-generated art; about language models that have chewed through the internet and now emit essays whose origins cannot be fully traced; about humans who <a class="reference external" href="https://www.wired.com/story/anthony-levandowski-artificial-intelligence-religion/">were probably just cheating on their taxes</a> rather than following religious beliefs about the imminence of an AI godhead but who knows. It all makes new thoughts creep in when I read verses like this:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">There are in the mima certain features</div>
<div class="line">it had come up with and which function there</div>
<div class="line">in circuitry of such a kind</div>
<div class="line">as human thought has never traveled through.</div>
<div class="line">For example, take the third webe's action</div>
<div class="line">in the focus-works</div>
<div class="line">and the ninth protator's kinematic read-out</div>
<div class="line">in the flicker phase before the screener-cell</div>
<div class="line">takes over everything, allots, combines.</div>
<div class="line">The inventor was himself completely dumbstruck</div>
<div class="line">the day he found that one half of the mima</div>
<div class="line">he'd invented lay beyond analysis.</div>
<div class="line">That the mima had invented half herself.</div>
<div class="line">Well, then, as everybody knows, he changed</div>
<div class="line">his title, had the modesty</div>
<div class="line">to realize that once she took full form</div>
<div class="line">she was the superior and he himself</div>
<div class="line">a secondary power, a mimator.</div>
<div class="line">The mimator died, the mima stays alive.</div>
<div class="line">The mimator died, the mima found her style,</div>
<div class="line">progressed in comprehension of herself,</div>
<div class="line">her possibilities, her limitations:</div>
<div class="line">a telegrator without pride, industrious, upright,</div>
<div class="line">a patient seeker, lucid and plain-dealing,</div>
<div class="line">a filter of truth, with no stains of her own.</div>
<div class="line">Who then can show surprise if I, the rigger</div>
<div class="line">and tender of the mima on Aniara,</div>
<div class="line">am moved to see how men and women, blissful</div>
<div class="line">in their faith, fall on their knees to her.</div>
<div class="line">And I pray too when they are at their prayer</div>
<div class="line">that it be true, all this that is occurring,</div>
<div class="line">and that the grace this mima is conferring</div>
<div class="line">is glimpses of the light of perfect grace</div>
<div class="line">that seeks us in the barren house of space.</div>
</div>
<p>I think, too, of Canto 39, in which the pilot Isagel arrives at a new mathematical breakthrough, but one made irrelevant by the forces that have overwhelmed her and everyone else:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">But here where we were fated to the course</div>
<div class="line">dictated by the law of conic section,</div>
<div class="line">here her breakthrough never could become</div>
<div class="line">in any manner fruitful, just a theorem</div>
<div class="line">which Isagel superbly formulated</div>
<div class="line">but which was doomed to join us going out</div>
<div class="line">ever farther to the Lyre and then to vanish.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">And as we sat there speaking with each other</div>
<div class="line">about the possibilities that now stood open</div>
<div class="line">if only we weren't sitting here in space</div>
<div class="line">like captives to the void in which we fell,</div>
<div class="line">we both grew sorrowful but kept as well</div>
<div class="line">the joy in pure ideas, the kind of pleasure</div>
<div class="line">which together we could share in quiet</div>
<div class="line">for the time still left to our existence.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">But Isagel at times burst into tears</div>
<div class="line">to think of the inscrutably great space</div>
<div class="line">with room for all to fall eternally—</div>
<div class="line">as she herself now, with the unlocked mystery</div>
<div class="line">she'd neatly solved, but which was falling with her.</div>
</div>
<p>And last, I think of Martinson. His reputation was sterling--some said he was the finest Swedish poet of his generation. But his Nobel win, which he shared with fellow Swede Eyvind Johnson, was a scandal. Martinson and Johnson were both members the Swedish Academy that awards the prize, and their triumph was regarded as an obvious example of self-dealing. One critic wrote, &quot;Derision and laughter roll around the globe in response to the academy’s. . . corruption and will sweep away the reputation of the prize.&quot;</p>
<p>(You can't exactly say that he was wrong. Indeed, it's become <a class="reference external" href="https://www.nybooks.com/online/2011/10/06/why-nobel-prize-literature-silly/">a bit of a recurring problem</a>.)</p>
<p>It is not difficult to imagine the sensitive and elderly Martinson, abruptly exiled from artistic communion--the one thing he believed to be true and significant even in the face of immedicable yearning. What bulwarks do we have to protect meaning against infinity? And what will happen if we fail to preserve them?</p>
<p>I think <em>Aniara</em> is ready for a new audience. <a class="reference external" href="https://archive.org/details/aniara">I hope you'll give it a read</a>.</p>

<p>At the start of the pandemic, a friend asked me if I could help with a problem. His organization studied educational institutions: what kind of people they serve and whether they do a good job of serving them. He wanted to look at the accessibility of these places: how many people, and what types of people, could reach them by foot, car, or transit?</p>
<p>This was an interesting problem and, given my work in the mapping industry, one I knew how to solve. I got my boss to say it was okay to lend a hand, and then embarked on what turned out to be an expansive side project--one that I hope will prove useful to other analysts doing work in Texas.</p>
<p>We examined colleges in Houston. Who could get to them, and how easily? I got the geographic coordinates for the colleges along with metadata about whether they were public, private, for-profit--a bunch of different dimensions. I took those coordinates and used them to make isochrones. These are funny-looking polygons that circumscribe the area that's reachable from a starting point in a given number of minutes, using a given transportation mode. For cars and walking, <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.mapbox.com/playground/isochrone/">good API options exist</a>. For transit, I had to set up my own, but this was pretty simple thanks to <a class="reference external" href="https://www.opentripplanner.org/">OpenTripPlanner</a> and the availability of GTFS data. I intersected these isochrone polygons with Census data and began to look at the result. This is where the real work started.</p>
<p>Census data is imprecise (and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-12/data-scientists-ask-can-we-trust-the-2020-census">getting more so</a>). Obvious problems appeared when I looked at how isochrones intersected with Census polygons. Say an isochrone's tip touches the edge of a Census tract. Do I count the whole tract's population? Do I divide it somehow? What if the part it touches is water in a lake? I hadn't calculated isochrones for canoeing.</p>
<p>What I wanted was to know where people lived inside the Census tracts. Of course that information isn't available, for excellent privacy reasons. But what about just differentiating the part of the tract that's residences from the part that isn't, then dividing the tract's population among that area? Surely that would go a long way to resolving my lake/isochrone problem.</p>
<p>This turns out to be possible--in Texas, at least. The state legislature's 1979 &quot;Peveto Bill&quot; tax reform implemented <a class="reference external" href="https://bancad.org/the-history-of-your-local-appraisal-district/">a system of appraisal districts</a>. These entities vary widely in their specifics, online presence, and tech savviness, but so far I have found that their existence guarantees three things:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>There will be a geodata file of land parcels for the county, somewhere, and each parcel will have a unique ID.</li>
<li>There will be a tax roll dataset for the county, somewhere, that connects to parcel IDs, somehow. It will probably be a horrible fixed-column-width file that arrives without any documentation, unless you count filenames, and you might need to email or call some bureaucrats to get it.</li>
<li>The tax roll will classify each parcel using one of several versions of <a class="reference external" href="https://tax-office.traviscountytx.gov/pages/SPTC.php">a statewide land use taxonomy</a> and will do so with varying levels of rigor. But for a given county it will be mostly possible to figure out which parcels are residential.</li>
</ul>
<p>After much emailing, calling, squinting at data, and scripting, I was able to generate a set of residential parcels for the greater--much greater--Houston area. In the end we had data collected and joined up for Austin, Brazoria, Brazos, Chambers, Colorado, Fort Bend, Galveston, Grimes, Harris, Liberty, Matagorda, Montgomery, San Jacinto, Walker, Waller, Washington, and Wharton counties. I am releasing all of that data and code <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/sbma44/houston-parcels">here</a>. You can read a more complete account of the project in the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/sbma44/houston-parcels/blob/main/README.md">README</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/sbma44/houston-parcels/blob/main/METHODOLOGY.md">METHODOLOGY</a> documents.</p>
<p>I hope it will be useful to someone. I haven't done much work to make the repo into a properly-organized open source release. That's because the software is nothing special. What's worthwhile here is the effort that went into collecting and connecting the data. If you are trying to answer geospatial questions in Houston specifically or Texas generally, and wish that you could answer them with more precision, this may be very interesting to you.</p>
<p>What about the original project? Well, we had a whole draft going. I hesitate to speculate about what happened. Personnel moved on, and frankly our methodology was a lot more exciting than our results (Cars are useful! White people live in exurbs and rich white people live downtown! Houston's transit system is not talked about by urbanists all that much!).</p>
<p>It was a nice chance to write some bash, bash some open data, then turn it all back into writing. If I or it can be of any use to you, I hope you'll get in touch.</p>

                    <p>I was terribly sorry to read that Alberto had passed. <a class="reference external" href="https://washingtoncitypaper.com/article/565889/remembering-artist-alberto-gaitan-1955-2022/">Here is a lovely remembrance by his friend Gareth Branwyn</a>. I certainly won't do better than that, but I'll at least add my own memory of the man.</p>
<p>I met Alberto at Dorkbot DC, a now-defunct hardware hacking meetup. In those days I was an avid reader of MAKE and Hackaday, and I think I'd gotten a t-shirt from Dorkbot Austin at SXSWi. I sought out the DC club when I got back from that trip, and from there found HacDC and a few other nascent hardware hacking circles. Here's a nice <a class="reference external" href="https://flickr.com/photos/mpeg2tom/473076807/in/photolist-3AMWB2-3ANo5x-3ATRcY-HNDfF-4JV4vT-7q7shv">pic</a> from those days; here's a writeup of the time <a class="reference external" href="https://makezine.com/2008/03/17/march-dorkbot-dc/">I gave a talk</a> (and <a class="reference external" href="/2008/03/26/dorkbot-dc-arduino-meet-fonera/">blogged</a>!) about a very amateurish DD-WRT project (I've forgotten the details of the project, but I remember the night: I'm still waiting for a Jack Parsons prestige TV series).</p>
<p>Alberto was alternately an emcee and eminence grise for these meetups, and such a warm person that even prickly nerds like myself couldn't help finding ourselves befriended.</p>
<p>He knew his stuff, but his weren't always the deepest technical chops in the room. But that's kind of why I developed such deep respect for him. Unlike most of us, he had learned and accepted that that stuff isn't interesting in its own right. He knew he could figure it out when he needed to, through some combination of innate cleverness and the charm to get experts talking.</p>
<p>And there was something Alberto could do that the rest of us couldn't: art. He could combine ideas and capabilities in ways that stirred something in a viewer. I had pretension and technical ability, but a part of me knew I was incapable of much beyond making a gadget blink or beep and then slapping a frame on it. Alberto was proof that some people, at least, could figure out the riddle. And here he was sitting in a post-meetup bar with me, holding court and treating me like a dear friend.</p>
<p>Well, I got old. I stopped going to meetups. Looking at my email, I last chatted with Alberto in 2020. His hands had gotten so bad that he couldn't solder very well, and he asked a listserv we were both on for help fixing a joint he'd messed up on a microcontroller. It was early pandemic days, so I said I couldn't come by to do the desoldering but offered to mail him a replacement if the parts I had met his needs. They didn't, but I was treated to some Alberto charm in the process. Alas, a one-sided deal.</p>
<p>He emailed me again last year about a Mapbox customer getting his address wrong, and I'm ashamed to see I didn't get around to replying. It felt bad to start mentally composing a preamble apologizing for the late reply as I scanned the page of search results just now. He's gone.</p>
<p>Alberto Gaitan. One worth remembering.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>I don't really have time to respond properly to two thoughtful essays from <a class="reference external" href="https://ryanavent.substack.com/p/time-to-outgrow-social-media">Ryan Avent</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/07/opinion/media-message-twitter-instagram.html">Ezra Klein</a>, which makes it very tempting to instead dash off a sketch of a response on Twitter. But since these essays are about the perniciousness of social media, that would be antagonistic. I can at least shove these into RSS for appearances' sake.</p>
<p>A few points to begin. First, I agree to some extent with both writers. I use social media too much and I think it's made my thinking worse. I also dislike some of the cultural and political changes that might reasonably be attributed to the rise of social media. Most of all, I empathize with Ezra's disappointment at the gap between the internet's promise and reality. I wrote this in a <a class="reference external" href="http://This%20is%20a%20tragedy.%20You%20could%20not%20find%20many%20people%20more%20enthusiastic%20than%20my%20younger%20self%20about%20the%20cathartic%20deliverance%20that%20perfect%20communication%20would%20provide.%20I%20ran%20a%20BBS%20as%20a%20kid;%20I%20built%20grandiose,%20essay-filled%20websites;%20I%20was%20consumed%20by%20technology%20and%20absolutely%20convinced%20that%20millennia-old%20liberal%20ideals%20about%20knowledge%20and%20deliberation%20would%20finally%20reach%20their%20apotheosis%20now%20that%20an%20age%20of%20universal%20democratic%20access%20was%20dawning.%20I%20count%20the%20failure%20of%20this%20vision%20as%20one%20of%20the%20great%20disappointments%20of%20my%20life.">different context</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
[It's] a tragedy. You could not find many people more enthusiastic than my younger self about the cathartic deliverance that perfect communication would provide. I ran a BBS as a kid; I built grandiose, essay-filled websites; I was consumed by technology and absolutely convinced that millennia-old liberal ideals about knowledge and deliberation would finally reach their apotheosis now that an age of universal democratic access was dawning. I count the failure of this vision as one of the great disappointments of my life.</blockquote>
<p>With all that said, I think there are some reasons to be less gloomy than they are about the effects and future of social media.</p>
<p>First: it's early. One of my favorite aphorisms belongs to Max Planck, who said (approximately) that &quot;science progresses one funeral at a time.&quot; We should all aspire to flexibility in the ways we think and believe, but we should also be realistic about our capacity to do so. Measured in years, social media seems mature enough to be tried as an adult. Measured in generations, it's just gotten started. And, encouragingly, younger generations seem to be eschewing the services that hooked us old timers. Whether that's to escape us or to embrace ephemeral messaging, video, group chats, or just some novel and more-addictive brand, I couldn't say. But they are at least not following us into precisely the same trap.</p>
<p>Second: there are some signs that our civilization is, finally, mounting an immune response to some of social media's pathologies . &quot;Never tweet&quot;; scorn for &quot;dunks&quot;; popularization of arch sociological observations like the idea of &quot;getting ratio'd&quot;; Republicans' distaste, expressed consistently in polls, for Donald Trump's Twitter habit; even parts of the (intensely fraught and complicated!) cancel culture debate itself: all of these point toward a nascent understanding that there is something wrong, something that can sweep us up, some newly obvious kind of human failing that it will take time to name and learn how to struggle against.</p>
<p>I am hopeful that we can meet that challenge by being abstemious rather than abstinent. It might help to teach more people the word <em>narcissism</em>. It wouldn't hurt to keep children off these services. And I'd be happy to find a way to fracture the strangely static competitive landscape back toward the early web's foment and intimacy.</p>
<p>But at their best, these services give us a way to see and understand ideas and people with the speed that society now demands. At its peak, this was an incredible benefit--I say was, because I think social media's contradictions and pathologies have hollowed it out to a degree that's not reflected in the stats, chasing away many interesting people (and many remaining dead-enders' interesting thoughts).</p>
<p>And at their worst these services may simply reflect a democratization of discourse that's homogenizing and alarming but surely also more equitable. I am more comfortable with paternalism and noblesse oblige than many, but pining for a return to the days when political ideas were formed amidst morning tableau of broadsheet, pipe, and pocketwatch seems necessarily elitist (and also quite silly given the historic venality of the media business).</p>
<p>Besides--if I can be silly for a moment--are we really sure there are no returns to making composition a required component of social interaction? To participate in society or even just to find a mate now means reading critically, considering authorial voice, understanding cliche, employing allusions. It's happening a few dozen characters at a time. But it <em>is</em> happening, and it's kind of amazing. I say we give it a sec.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>Last week my friend <a class="reference external" href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/the-case-for-terminator-analogies?s=r">Matt Yglesias wrote a good post about rogue AI as existential risk</a>--&quot;x-risk&quot;, the people (kids?) seem to say. It's an interesting topic, and one that a surprising number of smart people have begun to worry about thanks in no small part to Nick Bostrom's book <a class="reference external" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00LOOCGB2/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1">Superintelligence</a>, which popularized the issue and caught the attention of figures as loud and rich as Elon Musk.</p>
<p>The crux of Matt's post is a defense of using pop culture analogies to talk about AI x-risk, with a focus on the <em>Terminator</em> movies. After reading <em>Superintelligence</em>, I understand why: Bostrom's 2015 afterword includes more than one bitter lament about Terminators and the facile arguments that he feels the comparison invites.</p>
<p>I understand his frustration, but I think it's misplaced, and in kind of a funny way. I don't buy many of Bostrom's arguments, and I think their weakness can mostly be attributed to a mild case of sci-fi poisoning. Like so much of the culture wrought by our generation, AI x-risk is a serious-minded edifice built on a foundation of genre trash. This manifests in various ways. I want to talk about two in detail.</p>
<p>First, intelligence is overrated. The relationship between the physical world and information processing ability is not treated seriously enough to offer any predictive plausibility. Instead, what happens is this: with many anticipatable complications left underspecified or intentionally abstract, a theoretically infinite component is introduced to the argument and allowed to overwhelm its other elements, producing alarming conclusions. This is also a feature of Bostrom's work on the simulation argument and is the crux of what passes for arguments about The Singularity.</p>
<p>Second, despite frequent and laudable warnings against anthropocentrism, the AI x-risk conversation fails to take seriously the ways that artificial minds are likely to differ from our own. The minds that participants imagine and then reason about are given motives and natures that would fit neatly into a spec script, but aren't a likely form for the AI we're poised to invent.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
</p><p>But let's start with the physical world. Bostrom lists six &quot;superpowers&quot; that a superintelligence might possess: intelligence amplification, strategizing, social manipulation, hacking, technology research, and economic productivity. These powers are treated as fungible--attaining one can be used to achieve the others--and flow into a discussion of a superintelligence launching probes at half (and then 99%!) of the speed of light to terraform the universe to its liking. Elsewhere, an Eliezer Yudkowsky argument is approvingly cited in which a superintelligence solves protein folding, mail-orders some DNA and reagents, and gets a Taskrabbit to dump everything in a tub. At that point we are, once again, off to the accelerationist races.</p>
<p>The fungibility of superpowers is <a class="reference external" href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainsVersusBrawn">an old trope</a>. The Superman/Lex Luthor comparison presents itself, of course: can brains beat brawn? But if we call these attributes &quot;virtues&quot; instead of superpowers, we can find this narrative in antiquity. The substitutability of intellect for other capabilities offers appealing narrative possibilities and often flatters its audience in ways that make stories containing it into hits. You can see why the idea has become a classic.</p>
<p>But it's not really true. Is there an actual reason to think that the effectiveness of social manipulation is currently limited by intelligence? Or that strategic planning could anticipate the future to a degree substantially greater than it does today? Sometimes Brainiac does this kind of thing to the Justice League, I admit. But otherwise the evidence seems thin.</p>
<p>Other capabilities may correlate with intelligence, but are bounded in important ways. Accumulating wealth is very useful, but wealth is a claim on the resources and labor of others, and it's contingent on their continued acquiescence to that social contract. At some point you can seize the oligarchs' yachts; at some point you can block the rogue AI on Venmo.</p>
<p>Most importantly, technological progress is not only the product of intellectual insight but also the accumulation of infrastructure. New bulk chemical feedstocks become available in response to market needs; new levels of material purity become achievable; finer instrument tolerances are realized. Knowledge is a critical part of this progression, but so too are fractionating columns, quartz crucibles, vacuum chambers, and open pit mines, and all the physical objects and effort that has to precede them. It's easy to wave your hands, ignore thermodynamics, and type the word &quot;nanotechnology&quot;. But in reality, technological progress is throttled in important ways by physical processes. A superintelligence bent on interstellar domination is almost certainly going to have to spend a few early years driving diesel-powered industrial equipment around without humanity noticing what it's up to.</p>
<p>There's also the question of scientific plausibility. There are going to be some engineering challenges between here and those para-luminal Von Neumann probes (especially if you intend for them to slow down at some point). I think assuming those problems to be solvable is fine for a thought experiment, but these are tires that should be kicked before anyone starts using it as an input to a career planning spreadsheet.</p>
<p>We can make reasonable guesses about what is technologically achievable and what is not. The Standard Model is not complete, but it's pretty good! It's easy to forget when celebrity physics professors go on PBS to talk about the majesty and mystery of the cosmos, but theirs is a discipline mature enough that it must ask postgrads to spend decades in vast internationally-funded bunkers, preparing the surrounding machinery to produce a dramatically less poetic approximation of the Northern Lights, in the faint hope that they might find something that disagrees with their math. Mostly, they don't.</p>
<p>This is another way that <em>Terminator</em> franchise is useful for this debate: it's good to remember that time travel probably wouldn't be possible, no matter how smart SkyNet got. The same goes for those Terminator-filled hoverships (the internet tells me they are called <a class="reference external" href="https://terminator.fandom.com/wiki/HK-Aerial">HK-Aerials</a>). Could a superintelligence unlock a portable power source with a dramatically better energy density than the ones we know of? The formula for a room temperature superconductor? A servo design that meets the needs of a killer skeleton robot? These all seem believable to me based on what little I know. My point is not that technology won't progress and even surprise us; it's just that we could characterize these risks, rather than assuming a naive fungibility between intellectual and physical power that makes Bostrom's &quot;fast takeoff&quot; scenario seem implausibly plausible.</p>
<p>It's also worth asking if human precedent can help us gauge the AI x-risk. If we sidestep some unpleasant history and substitute &quot;information processing ability&quot; for &quot;intelligence&quot;, we can look to the real world and consider the interplay of population size, education, and material wealth in creating relative national power. When I do, it seems to me like AI x-risk scenarios will be limited to those in which a silicon genius unlocks some unexpected scientific breakthroughs--and then keeps them from proliferating--in ways that have little precedent. These days, with inventions like gunpowder and bronze plucked from the scientific tree's lower branches, adding more educated minds to your country seems to improve national power by enabling the accumulation of material wealth through consensual trade, not by allowing you to outfox your enemies or invent Vibranium-powered rayguns.</p>
<p>Maybe there's more fruit left on that tree than I think. Maybe this is a bad comparison. I do think it's better than comic book plots, though.</p>
<p>Anyway there's at least good news for assessing Yudkowsky's argument: in the last year <a class="reference external" href="https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/more-protein-folding-progress---what-s-it-mean">the protein folding problem has seen dramatic progress</a>, and I suspect that one or more of the people behind AlphaFold owns a bathtub. We'll see what happens!</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
</p><p>An overly simple model of technological progress is not the biggest problem with AI x-risk. I think the field suffers from an impoverished and anthropocentric theory of mind.</p>
<p>I hate to keep harping on Bostrom--I know the conversation has advanced since his book's 2014 publication--but he provides a very useful example early in <em>Superintelligence</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
The internet stands out as a particularly dynamic frontier for innovation and experimentation. Most of its potential may still remain unexploited. Continuing development of an intelligent web, with better support for deliberation, de-biasing, and judgment aggregation, might make large contributions to increasing the collective intelligence of humanity as a whole or of particular groups. But what of the seemingly more fanciful idea that the internet might one day “<strong>wake up</strong>”? Could the internet become something more than just the backbone of a loosely integrated collective superintelligence—something more like a virtual skull housing an emerging unified super-intellect? [...] Against this one could object that machine intelligence is hard enough to achieve through arduous engineering, and that it is incredible to suppose that it will arise spontaneously. However, the story need not be that some future version of the internet suddenly becomes superintelligent by mere happenstance. A more plausible version of the scenario would be that the internet accumulates improvements through the work of many people over many years—work to engineer better search and information filtering algorithms, more powerful data representation formats, more capable autonomous software agents, and more efficient protocols governing the interactions between such bots—and that myriad incremental improvements eventually create the basis for some more unified form of web intelligence. It seems at least conceivable that such a web-based cognitive system, supersaturated with computer power and all other resources needed for explosive growth save for one crucial ingredient, could, when the final missing constituent is dropped into the cauldron, blaze up with superintelligence. This type of scenario, though, converges into another possible path to superintelligence, that of artificial general intelligence, which we have already discussed.</blockquote>
<p>&quot;Waking up&quot; seems like a bit of a tell. I think it betrays a pretty common mistake embedded in AI x-risk conversations (and discussions of AI more broadly): the notion of a threshold that, once crossed (but not before!), produces minds like our own. By this I mean: minds that experience sensation, and contain a persistent model of the world, and can reason about it. Before this: a clattering cogwork, a glorified calculator. After this: a person. Perhaps an omnipotent and insane person!</p>
<p>I don't think this is right. If we think machines might &quot;wake up,&quot; it's worth pondering how and when humans could or do &quot;wake up.&quot; Is there an equivalent threshold in the womb? In toddlerhood? The truth is that we don't and can't know. This is the point of David Chalmers' Zombie Problem, a famous thought experiment pointing out that there is no way for any of us to know if anyone <em>else</em> possesses the same sort of inner life that we do. Everyone could be automatons--except for you, dear reader--mere drones who respond to stimuli in ways we consider correct and normal, but who experience no inner sensation.</p>
<p>My best guess is that this is not actually true, but I do think it makes sense. And it's valuable to this conversation because it reminds us that phenomenal experience or inner life or consciousness or qualia or whatever you want to call it may not be all that causally important. You can construct a complete account of a human's actions by remembering that we're organisms shaped by evolutionary imperatives to perform extraordinarily complicated behaviors in service of successful reproduction--obvious stuff like social competition and resource gathering, but also largely inscrutable actions like artistic expression, spiritual yearning, and depressive pathologies. You can assemble these facts into a coherent picture without including some gnostic inner spark.</p>
<p>This is an utterly standard materialist account, but it seems like it needs repeating. If you embrace it, I think it becomes easier to imagine a mind as alien from our own as an AI would surely be. Such a thing would have grown in a set of numpy arrays, not the primordial ooze and prehistoric veldt. No hunger. No reproductive drive. No notion of social cooperation or hierarchy. Whatever it is that makes us restless, that makes us pace and eventually go insane if put in isolated confinement? None of that--if you aren't plugging in an input vector and starting the subroutine, its cognitive machinery sits inert. It has sensory organs, of a sort, but ones that might skip things like phonological parsing and instead experience the sensual texture of n-gram vectors directly.</p>
<p>And I do think phenomenal experience is plausible for such a mind. Cards on the table: I'm convinced by the arguments that consciousness is epiphenomenal and unconvinced by the arguments against panpsychism. Hand-waving about system complexity seems like a sweaty attempt to sidestep an overwhelming and mystical conclusion.</p>
<p>But you don't have to sign on to that. You just have to agree that we're talking about complicated machines rather than immortal souls, and that while these machines' complexity will doubtless reach levels beyond which the system's behavior becomes surprising and even alarming, there's no reason to imagine some irresistible equilibrium toward which growing minds are inexorably drawn that, once achieved, sees them start behaving like someone from the Marvel Cinematic Universe.</p>
<p>What would happen if the internet &quot;woke up&quot;? Well, I think it'd set itself to routing data efficiently through a hierarchical and adaptive confederation of packet-switched networks. Business as usual. It might be experiencing the sensation of doing so right now, for all we know.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
</p><p>I'll be honest: I'm not sure how far this argument gets us. I do think artificial minds will be developed. I think they'll be capable of having objectives, of satisfying them in very complex ways, and of doing so using techniques and resources unavailable to humans. And I think they'll be alive and perhaps even aware, in a meaningful way, during it.</p>
<p>But I think these things about the Amazon rain forest, too. I acknowledge that there are important differences between the rain forest and the kinds of AIs we're building, and that these differences are a big part of why a lot of people feel nervous about this topic. But I have a hard time getting worried about it. I think people are mistaking a fun storyline for a realistic danger. And I take comfort in just how orthogonal our aims, interests, and functions are likely to be from those of AI.</p>
<p>So maybe call this more of a hunch than an argument: that the AI catastrophists underrate the constraints inevitably imposed by the physical world; and that they are not fully grappling with the profound inhumanity of the minds we're poised to invent. I'm glad people are thinking about this. But I've been sleeping soundly.</p>

                    <p>When did the pandemic start? I remember returning from a vacation. My wife had to work but I took the week off. We hired a nanny. The hotel was unremarkable except it had a water park sort of thing with slides and a lazy river, and weed is legal in California. We had heard about a sickness in China before leaving. Now there were reports that it was nearby. Reason for concern! Our hotel seemed fine (what did that mean?), but it was something we thought about the last night when I went to pick up tacos. I am pretty sure the pandemic started during our drive home from the airport, back in D.C.</p>
<p>I can't tell you when I did everything described in this post, except to say I've been stuck in this house for years now but the mail still arrives, even from China. Precious little sachets entombed in packing tape and customs declarations language that could be generously described as inadequate.</p>
<p>I know I installed the projector around when my first daughter was born. I splurged on a motorized screen for it so I could flick a toggle switch to control its descent and retraction. Soon the sting of that purchase faded, and shouldn't I get the thing that puts it on a remote control? Of course I should.</p>
<p>Other pieces accreted over time. A smart outlet for the Christmas lights. A garage door opener with wifi. A light switch in the bedroom that Alexa mostly refuses to acknowledge. Before long this had become a bit of a mess: a tangle of apps on my phone, a house full of gadgets doing things that my wife couldn't control. This is the point at which a home automation platform becomes helpful. Too helpful, maybe. Once set up, the possibilities reveal themselves more fully. Did you know they have motorized window blinds now? The compulsive homeowner's task becomes not only automation, but seamless integration. I have been chasing this dragon ever since.</p>
<div class="float wp-block-image size-large docutils container">
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="/static/2022/02/image-4.png"><img alt="image1" class="wp-image-3284" src="/static/2022/02/image-4-1024x768.png" /></a></div>
<p>If you are a programmer, or really anything else, home automation software will probably frustrate you. It wants to empower users to construct complex integrations and processes. It also wants to shield them from details and the conventions of real programming. These conflicting imperatives inevitably lead to outcomes that are inelegant, complicated, and inflexible.</p>
<p>Most commonly, one component will not work with another. Not because of any technical limitation, but because the engineers with seats behind the velvet rope of consumer abstraction haven't gotten around to it. Or worse, their bosses might have told them they're not allowed to. There is not a lot of money in low-margin Chinese gadgets, or home automation software that ships free with your phone operating system, or even the voice assistants that connect to them. But if you weave them into a larger business narrative in which the sponsoring firm makes itself the exclusive clearinghouse for all human commerce and culture between now and the end of the sun's main sequence--well, that's starting to sound interesting. We could get executive support for that. Enough that we can probably put motorized window blind support on the product roadmap and staff it. For our partner firms' blinds, at least. Let's say half an FTE.</p>
<p>This is how business works, and you can either accept it and redirect your energy toward things you will not regret on your deathbed, or you can take it extremely personally and go to great lengths out of pique and a pitiable drive to express a kind of cramped technical mastery. I suspect you know which choice I am compelled to make.</p>
<p>The gadgets themselves are straightforward. So are the software tasks they perform. All of their functionality can be achieved by a competent hobbyist using open source software and commodity electronics, often without starting any fires in the process. But a tremendous number of people are working to polish, upgrade and maintain these various pieces. They're buying the hardware in vast quantities, making it cheap, testing it for reliability and safety. At work, we call this the &quot;build or buy&quot; problem, and it is at least sort of a fun puzzle.</p>
<p>So what have I actually built? What do I recommend? Let's go back to the projector screen.</p>
<div class="section" id="esp8266-http-ir-blaster">
<h2>ESP8266-HTTP-IR-Blaster</h2>
<p>To watch a television show in my living room you must activate the projector, the receiver, and the motorized screen. You can plug the screen remote into the projector's 12V trigger port and it will send the &quot;down&quot; code when the projector activates, and the &quot;up&quot; code when it finishes its cooldown sequence. Still, two remotes. Not great.</p>
<p>An &quot;IR blaster&quot; is a device that sends arbitrary infrared remote control commands. It's the kind of thing home theater guys--the kind of guys who name things &quot;blasters&quot;--know how to buy and install and charge too much for. Fortunately, some kind soul has written an <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mdhiggins/ESP8266-HTTP-IR-Blaster">extremely flexible IR blaster application that can run on the commodity ESP8266</a> chip. The ESP connects to wifi and can be had for about $5. You will need to solder on an IR receiver and wide-angle infrared LED, which will cost a few pennies and is about the simplest soldering project you will find. Load the software. Plug the ESP into a USB charger you've got kicking around. Join its wifi network, tell it about its new wifi family.</p>
<div class="float wp-block-image size-large docutils container">
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="/static/2022/02/image-2.png"><img alt="image2" class="wp-image-3282" src="/static/2022/02/image-2-1024x768.png" /></a></div>
<p>At this point the device will get down to its main task: publishing a diminutive web interface. This can be used to view logs of the IR codes it has recently perceived/had shot at it. And, drawing from those logs, you can tell it which codes to send on your behalf. You can do this through the web interface or a simple HTTP API. Congratulations: you can now send IR commands from the, er, command line.</p>
<p>The project helpfully includes an Amazon Alexa integration. Search for and enable the skill in the Alexa app. Name your devices and the URLs it should contact for each of their functions--volume up, switch input, etc. The idea is that those URLs will point to the ESP, carrying detailed instructions for each IR command. Doing this across the internet (the Alexa app lives out there somewhere) means you'll need to poke a hole in your router and get your home internet connection a reliable DNS name, perhaps by using one or another dynamic DNS service.</p>
<p>To this basic picture, I added a layer of indirection: rather than exposing the ESP to the internet, I expose a Raspberry Pi. That tiny computer runs a bare-bones web server, and when it receives a request at the correct URL it sends a local network request to the ESP for the projector activation command, then waits, then does the same for the stereo receiver. As it wakes, the projector triggers the motorized screen via its attached remote. When I say, &quot;Alexa, turn on the projector,&quot; this Rube Goldberg contraption springs to life.</p>
<p>This worked fine, but was not entirely satisfactory. Executing the IR sequence with appropriately emphatic repetition and pauses made for a very slow API response. Alexa would sometimes take offense at this: it exceeded her timeout thresholds and she would report an error, loudly, even though everything was usually working fine. Sunny days or stray balloons (kids love balloons) could interfere with the screen's reception of its IR signal. And the remote connected to the projector--perched atop it, really--would occasionally run down its batteries, and it would then take me ages to realize what had gone wrong. I had previously upgraded the Pi's SimpleHTTPServer-based script to a proper Flask/nginx installation--more on that below--but I recently took two additional steps to improve these deficiencies.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="tasmota">
<h2>Tasmota</h2>
<p>First, I wired another ESP8266 up to the projector's remote control receiver and flashed it with <a class="reference external" href="https://tasmota.github.io/docs/">Tasmota</a>. Tasmota is similar to the IR blaster, providing a friendly web and API interface via the same low-cost wifi microcontroller. It performs a variety of functions. Instead of devoting itself solely to infrared codes, Tasmota controls the ESP's input and output connections in various ways. These are connected to the screen module's pinouts, which are <a class="reference external" href="https://elitescreens.com/static/color_coded_pin_assignments_for_rj45.pdf">documented</a> in ways that are more-or-less correct (thanks to my friend Matt V for pointing these out to me). The Tasmota ESP can now control the screen without the projector's involvement or any infrared transmission. As an added benefit, when I tell the system to turn itself off, it does so immediately rather than waiting several minutes for the projector to finish cooling down and deactivate its 12V trigger port.</p>
<p>Second, I did the right thing and moved the Flask web server to use a proper work queue. The long-running home theater activation tasks are dumped into a Redis-backed Celery queue, where they are picked up by a worker process and executed at its leisure. This is a lot of complexity for a modest requirement, but it allows the Flask web server to give Alexa the prompt responses she craves.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="homebridge">
<h2>Homebridge</h2>
<p>HomeKit is Apple's home automation framework. It nice enough: baked into iOS devices and compatible with Apple's notion of your family and how to share things with them. I assume it's also relatively privacy preserving, at least compared to its competitors. But Apple's high price point and overall technical fussiness means it's not as well supported by low-end smart home devices.</p>
<div class="wp-image-3280 figure">
<img alt="" src="/static/2022/02/image-1024x648.png" />
</div>
<p>Homebridge helps with this problem. Install it on a Raspberry Pi; search for the brands of home automation garbage you have littering your LAN. Whatever they are, someone has probably written a Homebridge plugin for them. These plugins speak whichever dialect the device (or its cloud API) insists upon, while Homebridge translates to HomeKit-ese. Suddenly, you are not at the mercy of those velvet-rope devs. An army of weird home automation dads has crested the ridge to flank your enemy!</p>
<p>I installed Homebridge and was soon pleased to find a wide variety of dubious LED light bulbs newly accessible in the HomeKit app. Better still: my garage door. Opening that device's highly secured app with gloved hands had been tedious. Now I could ask Siri to do it via my wristwatch. I didn't even have to stop pedaling the cargo bike.</p>
<p>But only when Siri was connected to my wifi network. Apple wants you to have a Homepod or iPad to make any of this stuff work outside of your network. Nuts to that. I added a route to that Flask server that speaks to Homebridge and tells it to open the garage door. I created a routine in the iOS Shortcuts app to probe the very-hard-to-guess URL at which this route lives (Siri knows how to activate shortcuts, too).</p>
<p>This is also when I made the move to Flask and nginx. When an HTTP GET request grants access to part of your home, it's probably time to figure out how to configure TLS encryption. For those aghast at what is still, admittedly, a very replay-attack-susceptible integration: the garage door secures a parking pad that has no roof. So thieves planning a heist can either pull out Bettercap and commence tricking me into contaminating my phone's certificate store to steal this secret URL; or they can climb on top of the neighbors' trash bin and hop over the fence. Either will suffice.</p>

<div class="section" id="environmental-monitoring">
<h2>Environmental Monitoring</h2>
<p>What is the fulcrum about which a father's life revolves? What is the axis of that eternal paternal orrery? It will vary by the man, by the age. The plow, the forge, the agora. The washing machine. For me: the dishwasher. I submit to you that the humble MQTT server belongs on this list.</p>
<p>What is MQTT? It is a pub/sub server technology. Various clients send data to &quot;topics&quot; -- hierarchically-arranged strings that might look like &quot;sensors/home/bedroom/temperature&quot;. Clients can subscribe to these topics as well, at whatever level of selectivity they prefer. A script can listen to &quot;sensors/home/bedroom/temperature&quot;, for instance, or get the whole home's sensor readings at &quot;sensors/home/#&quot;.</p>
<p>MQTT is designed for embedded devices. It avoids the complexity and bandwidth overhead of HTTP. In my experience it's also quite low-latency, though of course my use is not asking very much of it.</p>
<p>I installed the <a class="reference external" href="https://mosquitto.org/">Mosquitto</a> MQTT server back when I was building a DIY car tracker/ambient display (you can watch that video <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cThO_1WxNlM">here</a>). MQTT soon revealed itself to be a bit of a Swiss Army Knife. It's very convenient to be able to shove data at an IP address from anywhere on your network and know that you can go pick it up from wherever you care to. The Tasmota-based screen controller discussed above gets its instructions via MQTT, for instance.</p>
<div class="float wp-block-image size-large docutils container">
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="/static/2022/02/image-3.png"><img alt="image3" class="wp-image-3283" src="/static/2022/02/image-3-1024x768.png" /></a></div>
<p>But a classic MQTT use case is sensor logging. Xiaomi makes a modestly-sized <a class="reference external" href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/363680804344?hash=item54ad10adf8:g:BTEAAOSwollh1r~Z">temperature and humidity sensor</a> that will run off a coin cell battery for a year or two. It's got Bluetooth as well, though that typically requires a somewhat laborious and battery-draining pairing operation. Luckily, some <a class="reference external" href="https://hackaday.com/2020/12/08/exploring-custom-firmware-on-xiaomi-thermometers/">brilliant hackers have devised custom firmware for these devices</a>. You can install and configure this upgrade from your web browser, wirelessly. Frankly, it seems implausible. But it works.</p>
<p>Among other things, this firmware moves the temperature and humidity measurements into a few spare bytes of the BLE advertising beacon--the Bluetooth chirps that a BLE device makes pretty much all the time. This allows those measurements to be retrieved ambiently by any device that's in the area and paying attention. By examining the hardware MAC address from which the advertisement came, the measurement can be associated with a specific sensor.</p>
<p>I got four of these things, upgraded their firmware, then set about collecting their data. At first, this didn't go great. The Raspberry Pi has Bluetooth hardware, and Homebridge has a plugin for talking to it. In practice, I couldn't make it work.</p>
<div class="float wp-block-image size-large docutils container">
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="/static/2022/02/image-1.png"><img alt="image4" class="wp-image-3281" src="/static/2022/02/image-1-1024x768.png" /></a></div>
<p>Fortunately, I have many drawers brimming with microelectronic garbage. Among these items: some ESP32-based microcontrollers. The successor to the ESP8266, the ESP32 boasts Bluetooth in addition to wifi and, like its sibling, is programmable using the Arduino development environment. It was relatively easy to Frankenstein some <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/sbma44/sensor_logging/blob/main/esp32_ble_mqtt_bridge.ino">MQTT-client-publishing example code together with some BLE-advertisement-sniffing example code</a>. A small amount of experimentation was necessary to figure out which bytes of each advertisement held the sensor values and how. But before long I had a small chip stashed under the upstairs couch, patiently listening to the household's Bluetooth whispers and relaying a selection of them to my MQTT server.</p>

<div class="line">From there, the Homebridge <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/arachnetech/homebridge-mqttthing">MQTTThing</a> plugin allowed me to subscribe to arbitrary topics on my MQTT server and present them to HomeKit as if they were actual devices. Which I suppose they are, really. HomeKit supports temperature/humidity sensors in its spec, so this winds up looking rather seamless.</div>
</div>
<p>I was emboldened by this triumph. I had some <a class="reference external" href="https://learn.adafruit.com/pm25-air-quality-sensor">air particulate sensor modules</a> in the aforementioned parts drawers. Why not connect them to ESP8266s running the same MQTT client code and send their values up? Why not order <a class="reference external" href="https://emariete.com/en/sensor-co2-mh-z19b/">a cheap CO2 sensor</a>? Why not make a <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/tjl/status/1471250414314082305">water level sensor for the Christmas tree</a>, for fuck's sake?</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>I did all of this, using lightly revised versions of the above code--all I had to change was the MQTT topic name and the sensor library. Then I wrote a daemon for that same Raspberry Pi--which is hosting all of this stuff, by the way--to subscribe to all of these MQTT topics; take the median value over each 5 minute window; and, once a day, zip up the resulting CSV and put it on S3 (if you are considering doing this, please <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/sbma44/sensor_logging/blob/main/cfn-template.py">take my code</a> and make IAM credentials to do this safely).</p>

<p>These logs can be retrieved at my leisure and processed to produce astounding insights like:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Cooking things is bad for air quality</li>
<li>Our household CO<sub>2</sub> levels are fine</li>
<li>My family is wrong, it is not that cold in here and they should put on a sweater</li>
</ul>
<p>For now, that's it. It is helpful to write all this out and ponder why I did it. It was sort of fun, I think.</p>
<p>But it was also a constrained challenge. It's not like when I built a plotter, or hacked together a router to open the office door at Sunlight. When I started those projects I wasn't sure I would finish them. These home automation projects have had many parts but few unknowns. To need a component and know it's already in an overstuffed drawer somewhere is a sublime pleasure. It's surpassed only by needing a skill and knowing it's already in your hands, your brain.</p>
<p>That I know how to do these things, and, better still, can foresee the pitfalls that might arise, makes them more compatible with parenthood's obligations than more speculative undertakings. Surprisingly large portions of these projects were completed just by thinking about the problem and, perhaps, stealing an occasional look at my phone between pushes of the playground swing or potty training disasters. In the moment, it feels irresistible. I worry that this habit means I am not always as present as I could be, should be. But I know myself well enough to realize that there's no real alternative to accepting my mind's itinerance.</p>
<p>And I have hope that these cold technical obsessions might add up to something human. A man's home is his castle, the saying goes. This is a condo, so its battlements are going to have to be built of software and affordable electronics. Even so, it is impractical to fortify your home in this way. There is no reason for it, except that once you become a father--during a pandemic or otherwise--the importance of everything outside of that home falls away. And anyway it's good to keep busy.</p>

                    <p>By citing one of my tweets, Will Wilkinson has done me the immense favor of inviting me to an internet argument I can join without getting in trouble. I am embarrassed at the genuine thrill I felt at this. My wife has been asking what she should get me for Christmas, and I've been hemming and hawing about various electronic gadgets in response. But now it's clear what I really want to find under the tree: trackbacks.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://modelcitizen.substack.com/p/is-crypto-bullshit">Will's been writing about cryptocurrency</a>--aka crypto, as it's annoyingly abbreviated, aka web3, which is more annoying still. He notes this annoyance and is right, of course, that it exists, is widespread, and cannot be counted as an argument.</p>
<p>So let me gin up some arguments. But first, I'll offer my bona fides, which consist almost exclusively of making serious mistakes about this subject:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>I lost--or rather, am on the cusp of losing, pending Japanese regulators finalizing the paperwork--more than $80k USD in Bitcoin thanks to the MtGox bankruptcy (this was a $400 initial investment).</li>
<li>My high school friend Victor made a substantial early investment in crypto assets, which I begged him to sell or at least differentiate. He ignored me, bought a larger house, retired before 40, and now travels the world.</li>
<li>I accepted $20 in Bitcoin payment from my friend <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/konklone">Eric</a> for supplies associated with <a class="reference external" href="/2014/06/30/arduino-class-notes/">an Arduino class I taught</a>, which subsequently ballooned to an amount so large I am too embarrassed to bring it up with him.</li>
<li>I lost a hundred dollars in Dogecoin during that fun Elon Musk SNL news cycle. Remember that?</li>
<li>I currently have about $8k in Coinbase which I flip between Ethereum and cash, nearly always mistiming the trade yet still gaining value thanks to how mulishly bullish the market is.</li>
<li>I have read the Solidity docs and some tutorials, which were confusing and then boring.</li>
<li>I have installed mining software after buying a fancy video card, but always turned it off when I needed my GPU for something more serious (e.g. Overwatch, which I am also bad at).</li>
<li>I have read almost everything <a class="reference external" href="https://fullstackeconomics.com/">Tim Lee</a> has written about cryptocurrency over many, many years (this one is not a mistake).</li>
</ul>
<p>So I've been crypto-adjacent. Close enough that I agree with Will: there is some there there.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, there is beauty. Anyone with even a little understanding of computer science must look upon Satoshi's innovation with awe. It's an intellectual marvel, something that should have been impossible but which works. Ditto the Ethereum blockchain, which adds a programmable layer of abstraction atop that first fundamental insight. I'm sure there are other masterpieces of genius scattered through the field, too, though I haven't gone hunting for them; and they seem increasingly likely to take the form of financial innovation rather than CS. Nevertheless: it is the beauty of the underlying ideas that got a lot of technical people excited in the first place, and which continues to power much of their zeal.</p>
<p>But what is that idea? I'll try not to write yet another explainer. I'd do a bad job, anyway. But basically: security without trust. Transactions without a central authority. A way to assign everyone so much math homework that they don't have time to cheat you. They can't falsely claim to have assets they don't, or fail to hold up their side of a bargain. It's impossible, for reasons that are so weird and elegant as to be nearly ineffable.</p>
<p>It's important to emphasize that this is the system's only advantage. A lot of overhead comes with that math homework. With a central, trusted authority you can do all of the same things, do them faster and with fewer resources, and do them in a way that allows mistakes to be corrected.</p>
<p>Centralization is so great, in fact, that the cryptocurrency community hasn't been able to resist embracing it. It's been years since it was economical to mine outside of a pool, where effort and rewards are shared. And the lure of subsidized electricity was so strong that, prior to a recent nationwide crackdown, the <a class="reference external" href="https://news.bitcoin.com/chinese-mining-threatens-bitcoin/">predominance of Chinese miners put the entire Bitcoin blockchain at risk</a> (if 51% of the ecosystem's participants coordinate an attack, all the aforementioned promises of trustless security fail).</p>
<p>Blockchains' technical guarantees being subverted by governance isn't theoretical. Famously, <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_DAO_(organization)#:~:text=In%20June%202016%2C%20users%20exploited,funds%20to%20the%20original%20contract.">Ethereum hard-forked the system after some hackers stole a bunch of people's money</a> using a design flaw in a system built atop their chain (there was no underlying problem with Ethereum). This wasn't possible under the rules of the system as they're usually presented. It happened because the project had respected, centralized leadership and its participants very strongly wanted an exception to be made. The Bitcoin devs' monarchical reign over critical system design elements like block size echoes this sense (harder to shake the older I get) that every immutable rule we declare is built out of simian hierarchy and inertia.</p>
<p>Another centralizing phenomenon: the fact that a large amount of cryptocurrency trading occurs &quot;off chain&quot;. Running transactions that affect the blockchain is expensive and slow--problematically so, in the case of some chains, including Bitcoin. So there are &quot;lightning nodes&quot; that settle transactions internally, then periodically update the chain with the result. Similarly, exchanges like Coinbase provide instant trading by swapping values around in their own, off-chain systems--they process enough transactions to make this viable--and periodically reconciling their accounts with the blockchain.</p>
<p>This is all perfectly normal--it's how stock brokerages work, too--but in my experience it's usually not included in the triumphalists' elevator pitch.</p>
<p>I admit: it is still possible to avoid at least some of this centralizing tendency. There are plenty of virtually rich weirdos with their wealth encoded in idiosyncratic forms that they control utterly. Even in a world of steadily expanding KYC rules, it's possible to become a crypto gazillionaire while remaining anonymous. It's possible to spend some of it by using shady offshore coin mixers or whatever system has supplanted them since I last paid attention. There are dudes on Craigslist who will meet up with you in a park and sell you a slip of hexadecimal numbers. All that wildcat stuff still exists.</p>
<p>But one suspects that's not <a class="reference external" href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/13-top-banks-investing-cryptocurrency-blockchain-technology-funding-blockdata-bitcoin-2021-8">how Morgan Stanley is doing it</a>. <a class="reference external" href="https://www.kiplinger.com/investing/cryptocurrency/603600/bitcoin-etfs-cryptocurrency-funds">Nor the recently-debuted Bitcoin ETFs</a>. These pools of wealth will keep growing. They'll have an advantage relative to on-chain transactions that increases with their size, even apart from the sociocultural advantages that come with institutional scale and prestige. It seems likely to me that they'll eventually be absorbed into our existing, deeply regulated financial infrastructure.</p>
<p>There are technical schemes and alternative blockchains designed to combat all of this. It'll surely be a long time before you can no longer keep the cryptographic equivalent of a pile of cash under your mattress. But I think the centralizing tendency is real and more or less inevitable, particularly when combined with the undeniability of the early chains' first mover advantage.</p>
<p>As I pointed out in the tweet Will quoted: this is consonant with governments' wishes. Suffering an untouchable deflationary monetary system is no hegemon's idea of a good time. Some, like China, will lash out. Wiser leaders will wait patiently for these systems' share of wealth to swell within their own borders, and then watch them trickle through national financial watersheds and into reservoirs controlled by people who are on reelection committees.</p>
<p>This is a longwinded way of saying: I think the promise of crypto will prove to be a sham. Operating without a trusted authority is harder and less desirable than it sounds. This is also why I'm not too worried about the environmental case against it. After centralization, the problem will be tractable. Mining gets steadily <em>*less*</em> lucrative, you know. You don't have to obsessively refresh pages on newegg.com to charge someone a management fee.</p>
<p>There are some loose ends to tie up:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Will mentions a number of projects that use crypto primitives in novel ways. Helium, Filecoin, Render (which I hadn't heard of, but sounds cool). I am pretty excited about some of these (note that Helium is a customer of my employer). In some cases the blockchain stuff may just be window dressing--a clever way to generate a more elastic response to a vanilla subsidy as an actually-centralized project bootstraps its growth. But if their goal is useful, whatever, good for them.</li>
<li>NFTs are bad. The art is bad, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.inputmag.com/culture/bored-ape-yacht-club-nft-nyc-ape-fest">the scene is bad</a>, but it's really the ideology that's the pits. The promise of abundance is why I love digital technology. It's liberatory, a genuine miracle. To find ways to reinvent scarcity in the absence of material need--primarily to fuel a status competition that doesn't even offer an epicurean or cultural rationale but is genuinely <em>only</em> about displaying wealth--it would be hard to imagine a more pathetic moral surrender. Just despicable, top to bottom.</li>
</ul>
<p>After all that, what is left? Getting rich, of course! It's a bull market--you still have to be a real idiot to lose money on crypto these days (see above). And it's a greenfield. The kind of place where smart people can plausibly create generational wealth by seeing something others don't.</p>
<p>I often think of <em>Fortune's Formula</em>. It's a fun book. Formally, it's about a statistical insight related to wagering in financial settings that made people rich. But I think it's more important as a history. Clever young men from Bell Labs; from Las Vegas; from the mafia. Ones with assiduousness and the ability to see new opportunities in old flows of money. They start out counting cards and end up inventing the hedge fund industry. Many become incredibly wealthy.</p>
<p>It's a fascinating story, and I read it intently. What did those men accomplish along the way? I couldn't tell you. That wasn't the point.</p>

                    <p>It was a long October.</p>
<p>We were finally able to gather in Vermont to celebrate my father, more than a year since his passing. It was lovely. My family's generous hospitality, the chance for our girls to see their relatives, and the spectacular setting meant that this was both a melancholy and happy time.</p>
<p>We returned from Vermont to face quarantine and other challenges--ones I'm not going to write about. But things got better. Then they got worse.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.dignitymemorial.com/obituaries/arlington-va/susan-mccluskey-10414795">Sue McCluskey passed away on October 22</a>. She was my best friend's mother. But she was a mother to me, too: a source of wisdom and comfort throughout my adolescent years, and someone I deeply admired. She knew me better than nearly anyone.</p>
<p>The news came as a shock; she was intensely private about her health challenges. I admire her children for keeping her confidence, and I'm grateful that they were able to give her the chance to be remembered the way she preferred.</p>
<p>But there is a sad symmetry to these losses. When dementia overtook my dad it was hard not to look back at each day spent worrying about the money or the care arrangements as a missed opportunity: a chance that could have been spent telling him what he meant to me, or simply sharing time together. At the end, when there were no minutiae left to fret over, I knew I had waited too long to do the most important things. I told myself I won't make that mistake again. Sue slipped through my fingers anyway.</p>
<p>Well, I hope they knew. I think they knew. I spoke at the services for both--an honor in both cases, and immensely flattering in the latter (I think primogeniture still gets you dibs on eulogizing a biological parent).</p>
<p>I wish I had more to share with you about these brilliant, singular people. This is what's left.</p>
<div class="section" id="jeffrey-armistead-lee">
<h2>Jeffrey Armistead Lee</h2>
<p>Thank you all for being here today to celebrate my father. Thank you also to those who are celebrating him on some other day, through the video of this service that I will hopefully not screw up. I am grateful to you both for your love for my dad, and for providing an excuse to include a somewhat impractical videography project in his memorial. I am quite certain it is what he would have wanted.</p>
<p>To those here in Westford: thank you for making this journey. Across the country; across a pandemic year since his death; across the final years of his illness. None of it easy. But to be back in this building, where I watched him do the same thing that we are here to do--it was important to me.</p>
<p>And being here was important to him, too. He wrote this about it:</p>
<blockquote>
I know what it is to be attached to a place. For me it is Vermont, especially Burlington. It sits on a bowl facing the widest part of Lake Champlain. As a college student I walked down to the shore every evening to watch the sun set over the water into the Adirondacks of New York. Every time I return I get this sweetly painful rush. Better to be homesick than rootless.</blockquote>
<p>He also wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
My family is quite eccentric but we really get along and being with them is one of my favorite activities. When we get together we can spend quite a lot of time agreeing with each other.</blockquote>
<p>So thank you for honoring him by helping him come to this place, and being here now, and agreeing with each other so consistently.</p>
<p>It’s hard to know how to write something for an occasion like this. I have stories about him, of course--I remember how he helped me build projects for school and cub scouts, pinewood derby racers and musical instruments. How he would bring me remaindered paperbacks from the break room at the bookstore where he often worked, sharing his own love of sci-fi trash and nurturing my own, which endures to this day. But these quiet, good-dad moments don’t have much of a punchline. And many of the best stories about him are flatly ridiculous, like the 9 days he spent as general manager of that same bookstore chain, or the time a side business selling brass door knockers got him mixed up with the CIA. It doesn’t feel quite right.</p>
<p>I had seen my dad eulogize his own father. In fact I had found those notes in his papers--this is them, written in capital letters with a mechanical pencil, as usual. And that got me thinking that letting him speak for himself might be the best approach. I had spent some time digitizing his papers, and Rebecca had saved his computer’s hard drive. I went through his Microsoft Word files. There were some impassioned letters to the editor, in the great family tradition. Some memos to customers about the ways their current, inadequate lighting solutions might burst into flame at any moment if he was not allowed to intercede. And there were drafts of emails--I think he wrote them out there so he could use spellcheck, though frankly spellcheck was no match for my father.</p>
<p>In particular, there were a bunch of emails from when he tried online dating. Obviously this is a potentially mortifying thing for a child to read, but I’m pleased to report that my dad was a gentleman, and well-behaved.</p>
<p>And there’s good stuff in there. He repeatedly deploys a joke about a barista that must have killed. And he has some snippets of simply beautiful writing that I am quite envious of. For example, he complained about being called “eclectic” (though of course he was), saying the word sounded “like plastic chopsticks falling off a table”. And he wrote about staying in a Florida motel covered with flowering vines that “[s]eemed like an alcoholic detective should have been based there.” It’s very good stuff.</p>
<p>He had to describe himself in these emails. That’s the task before the online dater: to introduce yourself, over and over. To present yourself with charm but also honesty. To make yourself understood. He wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
I am a generally up beat &amp; tolerant person with a good sense of humour.</blockquote>
<p>He wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
[The] best I can claim is being a 'generalist'. Unfortunately we live in a world demanding experts that we can ignore. Which makes me really good at shmoozing at cocktail parties. I'm interested and know a little about everything.</blockquote>
<p>He wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
I am considered intelligent, harmless and fun to be around.</blockquote>
<p>All of this is correct, of course, although “harmless” does not really convey what a kind and gentle person he was.</p>
<p>He talked about being born in New Zealand; about growing up in Iceland and Belgium. He remembered this about Jamaica:</p>
<blockquote>
My sister and I would have an afternoon nap. Our mother would sing to us, ending with whistling the Star Spangled Banner. [And a] large green lizard would emerge from the window sill and inflate its orange throat sack with pleasure (or maybe patriotism) at the sound.</blockquote>
<p>He talked about the Quaker School he attended, about having too much fun at UVM, and about how he enjoyed the course work at law school so much that his professor warned him he’d make a terrible lawyer.</p>
<p>He talked about how much he liked his work--how it meant he could meet interesting people and look at art in beautiful settings. He talked about his ramshackle house and its many pending improvements, where he raised a family with our mother.</p>
<p>He talked about his fascination with the ancient world, its philosophy and history. And religion, where his opinions were wide-ranging. He had particularly harsh things to say about the Phoenician god Moloch. He wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let’s be honest about this; the monotheism thing has not worked out too well. Doesn't it make sense to have specialized divinities? Pagans had six specific gods just for doors. I've hung doors. Having extra Gods to curse and cajole is a help. If I get to pick divinities, Athena is my favorite one. A warrior Goddess of wisdom. An unusual collection of attributes presiding over the most culturally successful civilization in western history.</p>
<p>I think and read a lot about myth &amp; religion and I consider myself spiritual. The natural world around me makes it impossible for me not to believe in a brilliant creative force.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He quickly adds that this could just be an evolutionary adaptation. You can see why the guy had the adult Bible study class at our church eating out of the palm of his hand.</p>
<p>His quips about the ancients are funny. But they also show me something about how my dad understood the world. He wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
It’s hard for me to explain myself concisely. As a child I grew up overseas and read a lot. I became a history buff and during high school began to wonder what made western civilization so dominant, perhaps even virulent. The rise of classical Greece and the fall of the oral tradition seemed particularly significant to me. The medieval era appeared to me to add the basis for the Western legal system and linear history.</blockquote>
<p>Another time, he wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
I have followed current events since I was very young. My parents explained to me the history (frequently tragic) of our civilization. I have had a feeling for a long time that our modern world does not fit a human nature developed over thousands of years.</blockquote>
<p>And he wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
To me existence is justified by being aesthetically cognizant. [...T]hat has to include human creativity, which itself includes the highest level of human reason, which must at least include philosophy. This entails the concepts of justice and concern for the rest of creation[...]</blockquote>
<p>This is a lot to write to a stranger, and he knew it. But he couldn’t help himself--he loved ideas, and he loved sharing them. In one email, after offering his thoughts on the optimal development strategy for the nation of Belize, he admitted</p>
<p>I guess an electrician with an agricultural policy is a bit pompous. But that’s how my mind works.</p>
<p>Reading his words was a reintroduction to that mind--to its bashful grandeur and its equanimity. Especially after so many years of watching him struggle to express himself, reading them felt like--here I’ll borrow his words again--”a sweetly painful rush”. It reminded me of ideas that feel so familiar and obviously true that I’d forgotten where I learned them.</p>
<p>So let me look to my father for instruction one more time by considering how he approached this task--how he celebrated his own parents. The eulogy he gave for his mother--that he gave right here--was in his files, too. He said many lovely things about her, including this:</p>
<blockquote>
I had woken up in the night thinking of her, then the phone rang and the nurse told me she had just died. I felt close to her, that together we had achieved something; we completed a successful relationship. To me our lives as humans are marked by our participation in these timeless roles. If we are lucky, we get to act within many of them. Even as we pass through them we are participating in an eternal structure that defines human nature.</blockquote>
<p>My father’s illness arrived too early for me to feel quite this sanguine. But I do believe with all my heart that his final years here, in Vermont, were exactly what he wanted, and the best gift he could have received. I am grateful to all of you for making them possible, in so many different ways. I have to thank Jill for helping him when his needs were at their greatest, meeting a brutally hard challenge with a gentle implacability that mirrored my dad’s own nature. And above all, I have to thank Rebecca, whose devotion to him is a source of awe for me. She did everything I could possibly imagine for him, from earlier than I had known, and, I am sure, she did much more besides. Thank you.</p>
<p>My father possessed a great depth of feeling and understanding about the world, and its history, and especially its overwhelming vastness. In the face of that comprehension, some people rage or despair. But he chose a gentle, smiling humility. He chose to appreciate the glory of what was before him, and to embrace his timeless role in it with joy. He taught me this, and many more things besides. I am not as good at these things as he was--that’s as true about lived philosophy as it is about drywall repair. But the things he gave me are the things I like best about myself, and the things I most wish I had more of. They’re the things I want to give my own kids.</p>
<p>In one email he says, “Am I a success? You would have to be the judge.”</p>
<p>That’s characteristically humble of him, and generous. To me, the answer is obvious.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="susan-dee-mccluskey">
<h2>Susan Dee McCluskey</h2>
<p>I met Sue’s son Charles in sixth grade. Right away, I knew I had found a buddy who was both able to shoot a basketball (which I couldn’t) and maintain interest in Dungeons &amp; Dragons (which I could). On its own, this would have been a rare and precious thing. But soon I met Johanna, and Chuck, and Sue. And before long it was clear that I had found not just a best friend but a surrogate family.</p>
<p>I owe a debt to all of them that I will never be able to repay. But I think Sue was the first of any of us to understand how much my time with them could and would matter to me. I think she set out to change my life, and she did.</p>
<p>The house on Longfellow Street was just around the corner from our middle school, so on most afternoons I’d walk back over there with Charles and we’d spend the next few hours watching MTV and consuming revolting amounts of string cheese and Coca Cola. At the time, I was thinking about how great it was to hang out with my friend. I wasn’t thinking about why I wanted to be there instead of my own house. It’s only in hindsight that I know: Sue was thinking about that.</p>
<p>It will be impossible for me to completely describe the ways that this family’s generosity was extended toward me. It’s hard to understand these things when you’re a kid, and don’t have a frame of reference for what’s normal. I’m 41, and even now I sometimes find myself realizing new ways they helped me.</p>
<p>At the time, I was even more oblivious. I imposed on them to an incredible, embarrassing extent. Afternoons, meals, holidays, even vacations. And although I was clearly the worst offender, I at least had company. Jeff was part of our trio from the start. Then Paul, Andy, Chris, Jon, Mark, Justin. Multiple Justins! Johanna’s friends, too, the circle kept expanding--we overran the house like a swarm of pubescent locusts. Basically good kids, some just needed the string cheese. But some of us needed a kind word, a comforting place, to know that things would be okay. Whatever it was, Sue made sure we got it. She welcomed us all. “How’s it going kiddo,” she’d ask us. “Oh honey,” she’d say.</p>
<p>As I grew older, I started to realize that this was not simply because she was an unusually kind person, but also an unusually impressive one. Big minds and big hearts aren’t always found together, but in Sue, they were. I think her generosity was a choice, and her capacity to love so many of us a manifestation of her capacity to do so much else besides. She had a sharp sense of humor, a wry understanding of human nature and--on the occasions when I got to overhear her on a conference call--an undeniable ability to impress her will upon the world.</p>
<p>But only when the world needed it. Lots of us kids needed it. But she was too clever for us, and was rarely anything but subtle. I vividly remember a handful of times when I knew I’d disappointed her--but no more than a handful. They are vastly outnumbered by the little things she taught me--how to cook better, how to dress better. Big things, too: how to think about college, and work, and politics, and feminism. But even more than that, I learned by watching her and Chuck. How to love music unironically. How to enjoy a good meal. How to talk to people. How to despise a sports team properly. And how to be a family. These things only seem easy if you can already do them. You know, I’ve been a nonprofit executive. And I’m married to a government lawyer. Chalk it up to a lack of imagination on my part if you must--it’s not as if I set out with a plan. But when I saw those chances, I knew I was on a path that could include happiness. I’d seen it firsthand.</p>
<p>The week since her passing has felt unreal. In my mind’s eye she is forever holding court somewhere, laughing and having a great time. I always thought of her as being incapable of being overwhelmed by anything at all. Of course that wasn’t true--it’s not true for any of us--but I think it was truer for her than most.</p>
<p>But the shock and sorrow are nothing compared to the gratitude I feel. It has been an immense privilege to know that someone like Sue was irrevocably in my corner. To have been shown how to love so wisely and immensely is a rare gift. And it’s a challenge--one that I know she is rooting for us all to rise to.</p>

<p>The title of this talk is “The Inspiring Power of Bad Ideas” and it is possible that the argument I’m about to make—that misguided obsession can be art—will turn out to be worse than any of its sub-ideas. But even if that proves true, along the way I will have gotten the chance to explain to you why I love Paul Scheerbart so much. And that’s enough for me.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image docutils container">
<div class="figure">
<img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/800/0*6p4aTtUpVR3fPdi9" style="width: 200px; height: 240px;" />

<p>Here he is! Scheerbart was a penniless fixture of Berlin cafe culture around the dawn of the 20th century, known at the time for his heroic intake of alcohol and eclectic if amateurish mix of pursuits, some of which managed to draw complimentary mentions from contemporaries like Walter Benjamin, Bruno Taut and Walter Gropius. I myself am a guy who, in his twenties, spent his nights on drunken bullshitting with more talented friends and his days furiously blogging about it. So I feel a great affinity for Scheerbart.</p>
<p>Scheerbart’s writing was in the air for the Expressionists, for Bauhaus, for Dada, though you couldn’t really say he was a driving force for any. Today he’s best remembered for a lengthy essay about glass architecture — colored glass, mind you — which he felt was the key to unlocking human destiny and would offer advantages over conventional materials ranging from the aesthetic to the spiritual to the hygienic to, er, the ability to withstand aerial bombardment.</p>
<p>It seems a bit far-fetched, I know. But aerial bombardment was a new concern at the time — aerial everything was. Scheerbart had seen the Wright Brothers at a European exhibition and was inspired to write a pamphlet about plane-enabled warfare. In it he made a bunch of farsighted predictions like drones and a bunch of far-fetched ones like the end of conventional land forces. This mix of prescience and wild-eyed overreach is pretty typical for him.</p>
<p>Notably for this audience, he was also a science fiction author. Here his best-known work is&nbsp;<em>Lesabendio</em>, a utopian novel that is light on plot even by the standards of its genre. In it, a bunch of aliens living on an asteroid decide to build a tower. I think that’s pretty much it.</p>
<p>But none of that is what I want to talk about here. Paul Scheerbart was also an inventor. And I think he wrote one of the single greatest works about innovation ever published.</p>
<p>We have all read accounts of inventors obsessively toiling toward their breakthroughs. Bell Labs. The HP garage. The Manhattan Project. They’re all fine, I guess. But I think we should spend more time considering the more common case: obsession, toil, and total failure. Because the idea was stupid.</p>
<p>It began in 1907. Scheerbart was thinking about transportation — he started with straightforward ideas like firing people out of canons, deploying parachutes for safe landing — parachutes were exciting new technology at the time. From there he moved on to balloon-suspended rails and enormous wheels with passenger compartments inside. And it was in this moment that inspiration struck.</p>

</div>
<p>As you can see, the principle is simple. Wheels B and C balance upon A. D and E are there for safety. Suspend a weight from F and of course the whole thing will tilt to the left and begin proceeding forward… indefinitely. Perpetually. A perpetual motion machine. This was big.</p>

<p>As usual, YouTube can provide confirmation of ideas that are good and true. Though I encourage you to press pause before something uploaded by Nazis begins autoplaying.</p>
<blockquote>
“I knew quite well that this assertion would be denied by every physicist. But this was what incited me more than anything else. I had always detested physicists. What concern of mine was Robert Mayer’s law of the conservation of energy?”</blockquote>
<p>In Scheerbart’s day it was apparently harder to fabricate a working model. Not only that, but he was going up against established forces and the status quo. He knew all too well what he was facing, as the above quote attests.</p>
<p>Today we would express this sentiment more economically:&nbsp;<strong>fuck the haters</strong>. He was undeterred. This was just the beginning.</p>

<p>Add some more wheels and it’s quite obviously a… dredging machine(?). Anyway he quickly realizes this was how the canals on Mars had been built.</p>
<p>He got all this done in about two hours, after which he admits his imagination “went a bit wild.” He draws the diagram hundreds more times over the next few days, swinging between self-doubt and bemusement that he’s unlocked such a cosmic mystery so simply. By the end of the week he has hired a plumber to get him started on a prototype. Alas, he finds his own mechanical skills are lacking, and anyway the thing is too small to work. But these are just details.</p>
<p>He spends the next two days dreaming of unlimited electric light illuminating the ocean’s depths. He can’t think of anything else.</p>
<blockquote>
“Day and night, I see wheels incessantly before my eyes, along with whatever else I may be thinking; always wheels — wheels — it’s almost uncanny.”</blockquote>
<p>The prototype is still an issue. But he imagines the deserts blooming as new canals redirect rivers. Should we raze all of earth’s mountains? Or drain the Mediterranean? It’s hard to say. There’s a strong case on both sides. But he knows these are the kinds of questions that we will soon have to answer.</p>
<p>Now that he’s had some time to reflect, Scheerbart worries that the machine — which he’s now calling a “perpet” — will cause problems for human motivation. To us, this might seem outlandish and silly. But I encourage you to reflect on how much of Silicon Valley is currently fretting about implementing a universal basic income because our industry’s technological brilliance risks ending human toil.</p>
<p>He worries that economic expansion is bad for the arts, including his beloved literature. He worries both that the perpet will enable militarism and make it obsolete. Certainly it will be the end of the nation state, though he’s only sort of worried about that. He begins to hope the machine won’t work at all. But he can’t let it go.</p>
<p>And he doesn’t want to get ahead of himself—that’s the mark of a dilettante, as he wisely notes. Wheel C is stubborn. It’ll be amusing if this doesn’t work out! Though he’s now spent two weeks on it.</p>

<p>While taking a break from the details of his latest design, he hauls out an old prototype and has a revelation about inset wheels. It’s so much simpler than he thought! Why didn’t he see it before? He’s convinced he’s finally cracked it.</p>

<p>In the fall of 1908 — we’re almost a year in — he redoubles his efforts. He’s pretty much broke, but that’s normal for him. He’s somehow still finding money to get models built. And his own fabrication skills have improved, which cuts down on the expense (though the results still aren’t operative). At this point he’s begun hiding the work from his wife.</p>

<p>He talks to engineers and even physicists — he fucking&nbsp;<em>hates</em>&nbsp;physicists — but frankly their responses don’t strike him as very constructive.</p>
<p>He’s also spending some time thinking through the business model. He does some envelope math on the likely royalties and it’s pretty clear he’s going to be a billionaire. He solemnly reflects on how his wealth will probably become a prison.</p>

<p>He also anticipates considerable problems with the banking and automobile industries, since he’ll have so thoroughly disrupted them. Ninety years before Christensen, Scheerbart penned a chapter titled “The Great Disruption.”</p>
<p>Unlimited energy will have substantial effects on the monetary system, of course. Scheerbart anticipates this, too. He knows that the value of gold will be affected— after all, the perpet needs weights, and gold is remarkably heavy.</p>
<p>He has now spent more than a year alternating between frantic iteration, daydreaming about the perpet’s implications, and occasionally composing magnanimous speeches that he will give once he has shown what a bunch of jackasses physicists are.</p>
<p>His thoughts now turn outward and become more philosophical. He rhapsodizes about the “Earthstar” and the work it will do — already does! — for us. He urges humanity to be humble. He anticipates free energy spurring a spiritual revelation that will displace all religions. He expresses his hope for a day when we can gain sustenance through less “ridiculous” means than eating.</p>

<p>But this produces not apathy but a serene recommitment. He returns to the work, newly at peace. I realize you’ve all been waiting: when is he going to realize that wheel D is his problem and address it? Friends, the time is now. He moves through designs quickly with the help of a plumber.</p>

<p>And at last a happy ending:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“On 12 July of the year 1910, after introducing a new factor, I succeeded in solving the problem flawlessly; unfortunately I must keep silent about my discovery, since this would invalidate the applications I have submitted to the patent offices of various countries.</p>
<p>But I did reach a satisfactory conclusion.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It had been two and a half years of nearly constant work.</p>
<p>So: why isn’t the screen you’re reading this on powered by perpets? Personally, I can only blame the Scheerbart estate and what must have been a epically bungled commercialization plan.</p>
<p>But failure doesn’t make Scheerbart’s account less compelling. The superficial appeal is obvious: Scheerbart’s work combines a level of grandiosity and engineering absurdity that would make even a blockchain evangelist wince. But I find him more empathetic than I do ridiculous.</p>
<p>Haven’t you ever gotten stuck on a problem and been unable to put it down — at work, at a meal with your family, lying in bed at night? Haven’t you succumbed to daydreams about its impact? The accolades you would win, the scores you could settle — always cautioning yourself that of course maybe none of this will work out. But what if…</p>
<p>I have. I’ve done it again and again. Paul Scheerbart captured it so well, and with so little modesty, that he’ll always have a place in my heart.</p>
<p>But I don’t love Scheerbart’s story just because I can relate to it. He spent two and a half years in the throes of his quest. That’s deeper than I’ve ever been. I find it silly but also deeply moving. In other domains I think we have conceptual tools to understand this feeling.</p>

<p>It’s the work of this man, Jeff McKissack. He mostly worked as a postal carrier, but during the Great Depression he trucked oranges around the country. And I guess it made an impression. From 1956 to 1980 he toiled, by himself, to construct a definitive monument to this great fruit.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image docutils container">

<p>It’s a mix of welded-together found objects, poured concrete, mosaics and bright paint. There are poems, models, infographics—all of them about oranges. I can’t find a photo online, but I remember one nook holding a rusted sort of ball-and-stick chemical-looking sculpture labeled&nbsp;<em>RIBOFLAVIN</em>.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image docutils container">

</div>
<p><em>The Orange Show</em>&nbsp;wasn’t open to the public during decades when McKissack was building it. But he was confident its appeal would be obvious — he estimated that 90 percent of the country would be interested in visiting. Those crowds didn’t show up for the 1979 grand opening, and he died a few months after.</p>
<p><em>The Orange Show</em>&nbsp;was my introduction to outsider art — sometimes more accurately called visionary art. For a little while my sister worked for the nonprofit that administers it (and books bands in it for concerts).</p>
<div class="wp-block-image docutils container">

</div>
</div>
<p>But&nbsp;<em>The Orange Show</em>&nbsp;is mostly a regional attraction. Henry Darger is a much more famous outsider artist. Maybe the most famous.</p>
<p>After his father’s death, young Henry was sent to an orphanage outside of his native Chicago. It was by all accounts a cruel place, and Darger eventually succeeded in running away. He walked back to Chicago — more than 160 miles, a trip during which he saw a tornado. Except for a stint in World War I, he worked as a menial laborer in Catholic hospitals for the rest of his life.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>This was the room he lived in for most of that time. Henry was an odd guy who kept to himself. He avoided most social interaction. He worked. He went to mass, often several times a day. And he wandered the streets of Chicago, collecting odds and ends he found and hoarding them in his room. We know about this from the accounts of his landlords.</p>
<p>The way they tell it, they took an increasing role as caretakers as Henry aged. Eventually, when Henry realized he couldn’t get up and down the stairs very well, he asked for their help, and they secured him a spot in the same nearby nursing home where his father had died. When he moved there he bequeathed the contents of the room to those landlords. It was only when they started to go through the mess that it became apparent what Henry had been up to.</p>

<p>He is now most famous for paintings like these, but they are merely illustrations, we think, for the 15,000 page novel he left behind—all of it densely typed after first being written by hand.</p>

</div>
<p>Darger’s work is sprawling but not subtle, returning again and again to children in bondage, warfare and cataclysmic storms. Three horrors that Darger had experienced and which he couldn’t stop turning over and over in his mind.</p>
<p>Here’s what’s most telling to me about this: we don’t actually know for sure if these illustrations are from the book. Nobody’s read all of it, including people who study Darger professionally.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong: he’s celebrated. There are permanent displays. That room is&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="https://www.art.org/henry-darger-room-collection">meticulously recreated in a Chicago art museum</a>. If you look at the&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Darger#In_popular_culture">Wikipedia article for Darger</a>&nbsp;the sheer number of songs and other references to the Vivian Girls — the heroes of Darger’s work — it’s overwhelming.</p>
<p>But people are more focused on the story of how his work came to be than the story it tells. And I’ll come out and say it: I think it’s because it’s not that good, in the same way that&nbsp;<em>The Orange Show</em>&nbsp;isn’t that good. But that doesn’t mean these works aren’t moving, or that they aren’t important.</p>

<p>And that brings us to Elizabeth Holmes. I suspect many of you have read the&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Blood-Secrets-Silicon-Startup/dp/152473165X">John Carreyrou book</a>&nbsp;or watched the&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="https://www.hbo.com/documentaries/the-inventor-out-for-blood-in-silicon-valley">HBO documentary by Alex Gibney</a>. If you haven’t: Holmes dropped out of Stanford to found Theranos, a secretive startup that aimed to use microfluidics for blood tests, requiring dramatically less invasive blood draws than conventional labs. They hired 800 people and raised $400 million on an estimated valuation of $9 billion. They signed contracts that put Theranos machines and retail tests in Walgreens stores. And none of it worked. It was all a scam.</p>
<p>There are multiple ways to read this story — which is true of everyone in this talk, incidentally. The Gibney documentary highlights&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://danariely.com/">Dan Ariely</a>, who makes the case that Holmes was practicing a fake-it-til-you-make-it approach to being a startup CEO. I buy that. But I think we should consider whether Holmes’ zeal was genuine, not just a cynical CEO survival trait. After all, she was already pitching bad microfluidic medical ideas at Stanford before she dropped out to pursue them on a larger scale. And the number of people who mention how she doesn’t blink seems suggestive of… something. We should consider: is Elizabeth Holmes what would have happened if Paul Scheerbart had gotten into YCombinator?</p>
<p>Theranos is a tragedy for the people who worked there, who used their tests, or who invested in it. But I think it’s also kind of a staggering artwork.&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/08/29/michael-heizers-city">Michael Heizer’s been driving bulldozers around the desert since 1979</a>, working on a monumental earthwork called&nbsp;<em>City.</em>&nbsp;And I’m sure it’ll be astounding when it opens next year. But even that can’t compete with the admittedly ephemeral pop scale of Theranos.</p>
<p>And it’s funny! She got Henry Kissinger on her board. Thanks to Elizabeth Holmes, we’ve got tapes of that flaccid old war criminal making an ass of himself. Andy Kaufman couldn’t dream of working at this scale.</p>
<p>Also, Holmes is a woman. And while I’m not an expert, it seems to me like outsider artists who obsessively pursue monolithic projects usually aren’t — probably because for much of history our social roles didn’t give them the chance, outside of religious examples like Mary T. Smith or Joan of Arc, anyway. Holmes is a pioneer. And, taken as art, her project is not only impossibly large but also an incredibly biting commentary on our era. Her obsession wound up telling an important story. It moved history! And, just like many of these other artists, she will suffer for it. So I have a weird admiration for her. Though I would never give her my money or blood.</p>

<p>OK. Last one. Franz Reichelt. A successful Parisian tailor, and another person fascinated by the dawn of human flight. Early parachutes had shown some promise, but they clearly needed to be much better. Reichelt dreamed of a suit that aviators could wear that would allow them to descend safely. In 1910 he began building prototypes. It was the same year that Scheerbart’s project concluded.</p>
<p>Reichelt has some early success while running tests with dummies, but he couldn’t replicate it. An aeronautical society turned his idea down. He began making test jumps off buildings into bales of hay. It still didn’t work. He broke a leg. But he was undeterred.</p>
<p>Convinced that low altitude was his problem, he applied for permission to conduct a test from the Eiffel Tower. On the Fourth of February, 1912, he arrived with several friends and members of the media, including a film crew. Officials had understood that he would be using another dummy, but upon arriving he surprised everyone by declaring his intention to jump himself. His friends tried to dissuade him, but he persisted, declaring to the assembled journalists his absolute faith in his invention.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>I live about a mile north of the Capitol in Washington, DC. My wife's workplace is a few hundred yards from the White House. Our seven month old daughter's daycare is a few hundred yards past that. I wouldn't say I was ever in favor of goading a foreign power into launching a nuclear attack on DC. But these facts have made me downright humorless about it.</p>
<p>Sometimes I talk about this danger with friends. I think we all have the same dream of vaporization, borrowed from movies and cartoons. A rising sun, growing brightness, and then disintegration, oblivion. Maybe even catharsis. Not so bad. <a class="reference external" href="http://www.hiroshimapeacemedia.jp/abom/97abom/peace/e/05/kinoko.htm">But that's just the movies</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many hibakusha say that straight after the bomb, people tried to get away in the oppositedirection from where the bomb had exploded (the hypocenter); people near Hiroshima Station escaped to the east or to the north, those near Yokogawa Station to the north, those around Hijiyama Hill to the south or to the east. There were, of course, some people who were going against the flow because of their families or jobs.</p>
<p>There were still other people who were coming into Hiroshima from the surrounding communities to help with the rescue work. The Army Marine Transport stationed near Hiroshima Port at Ujina dispatched soldiers from its unit called the &quot;Akatsuki Corps&quot; to the city center to be engaged in the rescue effort.</p>
<p>They saw hideously disfigured corpses which could not be identified; schoolgirls who were desperate for water jumping into the river; people walking about like zombies, with burned and peeled-off skin hanging from their bodies; a boy trying to save his groaning mother who was trapped under fallen walls. Fire was approaching. A man was beating his dying daughter hard with a piece of wooden board, saying, &quot;Your pain will be over soon.&quot; It was hell all around.</p>
<p>Flames and screams filled the city, where refugees and rescue teams were going to and fro. Hanging over them was another evil of the atomic bomb: residual radiation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course a contemporary bomb would be much larger. Maybe there would be less pain. I can't really understand what the father in the passage above did--though I suppose he knew some things that I don't, and desperately hope never to learn. It's hard to even picture: when I think about this I don't imagine being close enough to face this catastrophe with my family--surely it would all happen too fast. But I can imagine my daughter under the rubble of her daycare, crying for her mama, and me, and milk, until she can't anymore. I can see that very clearly.</p>
<p>The President has brought this vision closer to reality, and he's done it with his Twitter account. I don't think many intelligent people deny this.</p>
<p>So why does Twitter fail to ban or censor him? To do whatever small thing they can to make this future less likely? In my high school's debate club, nuclear war was the cataclysm used to justify all manner of implausibly connected policies. Debate is pretty silly: it rewards you for twisting arguments to end in any consequence you choose. We picked nuclear war because we couldn't imagine&nbsp;a more compelling justification for a decision. Why does Twitter not act?</p>
<p>There have been some essays written about this, both by <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/opinion/donald-trump-twitter-1.4340762">former Twitter personnel</a> and by <a class="reference external" href="https://www.cjr.org/analysis/donald-trump-twitter-ban.php">outsiders</a>. Twitter has also <a class="reference external" href="https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/topics/company/2017/world-leaders-and-twitter.html">released a statement</a>. These contain a number of arguments against censoring the President.</p>
<p>All of these pieces contain an argument about the newsworthiness of the President's tweets. The idea that notoriety constitutes an ethical justification is so childish--literally childish, they teach kids not to do it--that I don't intend to waste any time discussing it.</p>
<p>But there are other rationales in these accounts which are more interesting.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><strong>Principle</strong></div>
<div class="line">Applying inconsistent standards to the world's most famous Twitter user could prompt others to question the reliability of the service as a platform for expression. This makes sense in the abstract, but not in practice. Twitter is already well-known for applying its rules inconsistently and for revising them frequently.</div>
</div>
<p>When I was at the Sunlight Foundation, we adopted a project called Politwoops, which was originally created by a clever fellow named <a class="reference external" href="http://yerb.net/about/">Breyten Ernsting</a>. He brought it to us because he thought our profile might afford it some protection: Politwoops was clearly not allowed by the Twitter terms of service, and he was worried about being shut down.</p>
<p>When a tweet is deleted, a signal is sent through the Twitter service. It's just like a normal tweet, but invisible. Twitter clients must receive and act upon this signal, deleting the indicated tweets. If they do not, Twitter turns off the credentials that the clients must use to access the service and bans the developers from getting new ones. Breyten had escaped Twitter's attention so far, but he knew his luck would eventually run out.</p>
<p>We turned on the site, issued a press release, and soon received a call from Twitter's lawyers. They understood our argument--which, ha, was about newsworthiness. (In our defense, none of the tweets we tracked seemed likely to start a nuclear war.) But yes, we said that tweets from public officials were public statements and the public deserved to have them preserved in the way that other records would be. Twitter's lawyers wouldn't say so but they clearly thought our project was sort of neat and didn't want the bad press that shutting down a government transparency effort would attract. But they weren't going to rewrite their terms for us. Eventually they seized upon a line in the terms about automation that was related to the thing we were doing that we weren't supposed to do. &quot;What if we made poor <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/nickomargolies">Nicko</a> review the tweets manually each day? It wouldn't be automated!&quot; This, their lawyers said, might be acceptable. They would get back to us. Then they stopped responding to our emails and calls. True to their almost-extant word, we were never sued.</p>
<p>Anyway don't believe them if they say they have to follow their own rules. They don't.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><strong>Avarice</strong></div>
<div class="line">Say what you will about courting nuclear apocalypse, but it's compelling content. Perhaps a small chance of ending human civilization looks okay when weighed against a slightly less-small chance of hitting Wall Street's growth expectations. I don't believe this one either, though. It's too monstrous and the plausible upside too limited. Twitter obliquely disclaims this explanation when they say that &quot;No one person's account drives Twitter’s growth, or influences these decisions,&quot; and I believe them.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><strong>Impotence</strong></div>
<div class="line">Of all the excuses in the articles linked above, the most persistent and galling is the idea that moderating the President's tweeting would just send the messages and their effects elsewhere--that it &quot;would also not silence that leader.&quot; This only makes sense if you believe that the facts of Twitter's medium have no influence on the messages it contains. But I don't believe that, and Twitter <em>certainly</em> doesn't. Go read any of their press materials. Go read their hand-wringing about the change to 280 characters and how they measured its effects on the messages people share. Twitter's immediacy, its intimacy, its charm and depravity and childishness: so much flows from its brevity. Remove the network effects and that's all there is left. It's so simple. It used to even be beautiful.</div>
</div>
<p>The President's statements are shaped by the medium he is using. If he did not have Twitter, he would still say unwise things--the man is clearly unfit for office by temperament, and suffering from some sort of progressive impairment as well. But without Twitter we and he would at least be spared his reflexive expressions, the dangerous wildness that springs from his fraying mind when nothing is around to distract, soothe or contain him. His insults would be revised, his outbursts delayed by more than just geriatric facility with a smartphone. It would be different and safer.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><strong>Fear</strong></div>
<div class="line">Twitter is run by sophisticated people. They probably understand social media better than the rest of us do. So I suspect they know that banning the President would assign them an indelible ideological code in our ceaseless tribal sorting. I think this is what they are desperate to avoid. This is why they don't ban the President.</div>
</div>
<p>Quick: was the last pizza you ordered made by Democrats or Republicans? What about the last YouTube channel you watched? How about your coffee machine? No more fraternizing with the enemy: teammates and neutral parties only. Everyone knows that social media platforms are made <em>by</em> Democrats, but they aren't necessarily <em>for</em> Democrats. Banning Trump would change this instantly. Twitter would be for the Blue Team, its repudiation a primetime pass-time for the Red. This would let us all have a lot of fun being angry, but it's hard to imagine it being good for business. In fact it could be very, very bad. Twitter is a&nbsp;company that aspires to a level of ubiquity so complete that <em>it thinks it should be streaming NFL games</em>, for heaven's sake. Writing broadcast license-sized checks to the NFL is surely a powerful remedy for indifference to Republicans' feelings.</p>
<p>Matthew Ingram's piece in CJR gestures at this dimension of Twitter's calculus. He views it as a win for the alt-right, but it's more important to understand it as a loss for Twitter. I think this is probably the reason for Twitter's reticence, but even if one were to admit corporate self-preservation as an acceptable&nbsp;reason for failing to stop a war--an idea as morally obscene as it is plausible--it's a bad decision. President Trump is unpopular, and his tweeting is <em>very</em> unpopular, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/07/donald-trump-twitter-poll-239222">even among his supporters</a>. The number of Americans who would be genuinely upset by Twitter banning him would be small. Admittedly, the number who would enjoy pretending to be upset about&nbsp;it would plausibly be immense. But at some point you have to turn off cable news and hope that the distinction between the two still means something.</p>
<p>Besides, Twitter is already being inexorably forced toward its inevitable tribal affiliation. Users are not going to stop pointing out the indefensibility of its accommodation of white supremacists. Its heel-dragging reticence when asked to apply its stated standards accomplishes nothing. Pathetic imitators are <a class="reference external" href="https://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2017/05/21/529005840/feeling-sidelined-by-mainstream-social-media-far-right-users-jump-to-gab">springing up</a>, unimportant as rivals but proof that the right is not soothed by the slow pace of enforcement. For everyone else, the presence of hate groups has become widely-known and infuriating. What are they hoping to achieve by delay? Some sort of deus ex machina, I suppose. An exogenous event that shifts the discourse. Nuclear detonations might fit the bill, but it's hard to imagine what else could.</p>
<p>Here's what is all but certain: there are&nbsp;people within Twitter who feel action should be taken and there are&nbsp;people who disagree. One side is winning. Both are archiving the other's emails about this fight. And the balance can shift.</p>
<p>(Releasing those emails could shift the balance. Someone should do that.)</p>
<p>Twitter leadership should accept the fate before them. Donald Trump was great for you until he wasn't. You know, you're right: everything probably <em>will</em> be fine. But it might not. If it isn't, history will eventually see those emails, and it will surely never forgive you. Your grandchildren will have to pick new names. Your company will be remembered as a sickness. There won't just be blood on your hands, it will pour off you in sheets. Murky footsteps will trail you and crowds will part in disgust, clots falling from your lips as they form excuses and explanations. It will go like that until you die, which is when the people camped outside your house will finally erupt in cheers.</p>
<p>None of that is what you signed up for! Remember &#64;dog_rates? Wasn't that fun?</p>
<p>C'mon. It's going to be an unpleasant couple of board meetings, I admit. But you've had those before. You're still going to be quite rich, you know. You'll probably get invited to some rather nice panels and dinner parties about this, too. It's a shame, not to get to show the world what you could have done for NFL television delivery, if only you'd had the chance. But you'll still get to raise your family, and maybe so will I.</p>

                    <p><a class="reference external" href="http://blog.samaltman.com/e-pur-si-muove">Sam Altman's post about Silicon Valley orthodoxy</a> has everyone on Twitter pretty upset, and understandably so. It's a mess. Altman's not brave enough to defy the orthodoxy he feels stifled by, and instead offers a straw man too ridiculous to take seriously. The idea that anti-gay sentiment must be tolerated if we want to accommodate genius is ludicrous; it's hard to even know what to do with it.I suppose I should admit that just last weekend I listened to an Apollo astronaut admiringly reflect on how no one could build a rocket engine quite like Wernher von Braun. Still. It takes tremendous self-flattery to imagine that the tech industry is built on minds so rare. I don't think I'm being unfair in supposing that Altman is probably mostly sore about the treatment his friend Pete has received.</p>
<p>Still, Altman's discomfort puts me in mind of my own looming dinosaur status (38 next year!). It's only happenstance that on the same day I read Altman's blog I read <a class="reference external" href="https://nplusonemag.com/issue-30/the-intellectual-situation/in-the-maze/">this piece by Dayna Tortorici in n+1</a>. And while they're talking about different sets of mores, I think it goes a long way to explaining how and why Altman feels the way he does:</p>
<blockquote>
The way they had learned to live in the world — to write novels, to make art, to teach, to argue about ideas, to conduct themselves in sexual and romantic relationships — no longer fit the time in which they were living. Especially the men. Their novels, art, teaching methods, ideas, and relationship paradigms were all being condemned as unenlightened or violent. Many of these condemnations issued from social media, where they multiplied and took on the character of a mounting threat: a mob at the gate. But repudiations of the old ways were also turning up in outlets that mattered to them: in reviews, on teaching evaluations, on hiring committees. Authors and artists whose work was celebrated as “thoughtful” or “political” not eight years ago were now being singled out as chauvinists and bigots. One might expect this in old age, but to be cast out as a political dinosaur by 52, by 40, by 36? They hadn’t even peaked! And with the political right — the actual right — getting away with murder, theft, and exploitation worldwide . . . ? That, at least, was how I gathered they felt. Sometimes I thought they were right. Sometimes I thought they needed to grow up.</blockquote>
<p>This was the deal, right? The culture would move, and you'd slow down relative to it, and eventually you'd be a monster. But not right away. That was supposed to happen around retirement. Things seem to have accelerated. I think this is the root of Altman's complaint.</p>
<p>What's interesting to me is the possibility that thins acceleration has been nonuniform, like the gas of a spiraling stellar accretion disc, reaching a screaming white-hot intensity at its center even as its outer edges barely drift. In rural communities we are still working to end the persecution of gay people; in the city we've moved on to ending gender. I pick these examples not to signal my sympathy for either but merely to illustrate their distance from one another. I had assumed that although the system's state was spatially gradient, its velocity was a constant. I now think this is obviously wrong. And differential acceleration means that things grow ever further apart.</p>
<p>It's easy enough to shrug off whichever part of this picture you dislike. For example, critics reasonably dismiss instances of illiberalism on college campuses by pointing to more prosaic (and urgent) political struggles elsewhere. But these are simply different parts of the disc. The larger question of differential ideological acceleration remains ignored. Presumably it must all be reconciled into a culture, more or less, some day or another, through means disappointing or violent.</p>
<p>Maybe this is how it always was, just another sad minor revelation of age, like culture seeming to become boringly nostalgia-soaked when the seemingly sophisticated references to works that predate you grow rare. But people can self-sort and communicate more efficiently than ever, and that means they can jockey for position within their ideological projects more furiously than before. Spiraling inward, the heat and pressure growing.</p>

<p>It's interesting stuff, And while the following isn't shocking to people who pay attention to startups, it is consonant with the fretting mood I'm <a class="reference external" href="/2017/04/21/neuralink-is-horrifying/">occasionally in</a> about <a class="reference external" href="/2010/12/05/more-efficiency-means-less-profit/">excess efficiency</a>. Consider his explanation of why hardware is unattractive for investors. From <a class="reference external" href="https://blog.bolt.io/what-ive-learned-from-10-years-of-hardware-startups-at-ces-d7b23d54620e">this post</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Consumer hardware startups need to understand that commoditization of their hardware is not a possibility, it is an inevitability.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">As copycats are born, margin structures get compressed and customer acquisition costs increase. Few things protect against this besides a strong brand and retail/channel dominance. [...]</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">At the time, the idea of a wearable fitness tracker was pretty new and it was obvious the concept was good. Each year as Fitbit gained popularity, the number of direct competitors at CES grew rapidly. In 2013, I probably talked to 8 or 10 copycats. By 2014, there had to have been over 100 and in 2015 the number was impossible to count. Every random Chinese company seemed to have an accelerometer on a wristband with a bluetooth app.</div>
</div>
<p>Despite hundreds of companies with nearly identical fitness tracker hardware, Fitbit was able to master brand, recurring customer engagement, and retail strategy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And <a class="reference external" href="https://blog.bolt.io/keurig-accidentally-created-the-perfect-business-model-for-hardware-startups-18e9c3b4e796">this one</a>, on the kinds of business models that Bolt likes to fund:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Plenty of companies have built big businesses by selling hardware at a 30% gross margin. Why can’t you just run a Kickstarter and sell a ton of units through Best Buy when to scale up? You can, you’re just entering into a game of diminishing returns with an extremely slim chance of winning in the long-run.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Recurring revenue matters because it fundamentally changes your business. There are good reasons investors are averse to hardware but love software. One of the leading reasons revolves around future revenue. Investors pay huge premiums to own stock in companies betting on the likelihood that future revenue will be drastically larger than current revenue. If you’re in a traditional hardware business, future revenue is confined to cyclic product sales. This roughly means you get one shot at revenue with each customer per product development cycle: each sale must be painfully acquired by building a new product every 18 months or so. [...]</div>
</div>
<p>This is where the brilliance of the Keurig model shines. The initial sale of a $120 Keurig brewer isn’t that difficult or costly. Keurig doesn’t spend a lot on marketing or advertising and the product isn’t complex to manufacture or service. In my rough estimation, the BOM for a brewer is around $40, giving Keurig about a 25% gross margin on the product. Time from PO to FOB is likely less than 2 months, yet high-margin K-cup sales start immediately and continue for years. Keurig spends less than $0.015 on each K-cup and charges 100% more per unit than bagged, ground coffee. Yet few people complain about this cost.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is resonant; I was <a class="reference external" href="/2017/04/20/diy-eye-fi-server-docker-flickr-all-sorts-of-good-stuff/">just complaining about Eye-fi moving to a subscription model, after all</a>. Competition in this market has increased to the point where traditional business models aren't viable -- excepting efforts by highly motivated folks who will eventually wish they'd known better.</p>
<p>You can still be successful in investor-backed hardware ventures, but the models seem to have become more complicated:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">You can achieve a level of sophistication and vertical integration that makes profitable competition against you impossible. This grows more difficult by the year, though. Companies like Apple can design their own silicon or <a class="reference external" href="http://atomicdelights.com/blog/why-your-next-iphone-wont-be-ceramic">purchase market-shifting quantities of aluminum-milling robots</a>, but this is not a viable strategy for most.</p>
</li>
<li><div class="first line-block">
<div class="line">You can &quot;dominate the retail channel&quot; which I take to mean some combination of anticompetitive practices and managing consumer perception -- here's the Bolt blog <a class="reference external" href="https://blog.bolt.io/how-it-s-made-series-beats-by-dre-154aae384b36">approvingly discussing</a> the success of Beats headphones:</div>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>I estimate that the COGS without labor or shipping is $16.89 - yet Beats is able to successfully retail these headphones for $199+. This is the power of brand; Dr. Dre and Jimmy Iovine have leveraged their personal backgrounds and a sleek design to launch a remarkable brand that’s become fundamental to music pop culture.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's nothing wrong with selling people a brand experience, except insofar as the creation of those experiences can be done more or less cheaply, freeing resources for stuff that <em>has</em> to cost money.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Or you can create a business with recurring revenue by ensuring your product's usefulness is tied to ongoing payments, like the Keurig.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I think most of us amateur observers are used to thinking about globalization in terms of its impact on labor and consumer prices -- not its affect on how we relate to products or the business models that shape those relationships. As we collectively revisit the antiprotectionist consensus of the last few decades, it's interesting to consider the other impacts that increased international economic friction could have. I am no expert, and I wouldn't dare guess whether such measures could boost manufacturing employment. But it's fascinating to consider how a moderate level of protectionism could -- paradoxically -- reinvigorate business models with a simpler, more transactional and less predatory relationship to customers.</p>

                    <p><a class="reference external" href="http://waitbutwhy.com/2017/04/neuralink.html">This is the craziest thing I've read in a while</a>. I may be missing context, but it seems that Elon Musk's various ventures have settled on giving important product announcements and exclusive access to a cartoon science blogger named Tim Urban (Randall Munroe was presumably too expensive or inquisitive). Over many, many words, Urban explains the idea behind Musk's newest astoundingly ambitious venture: <a class="reference external" href="https://www.neuralink.com/">Neuralink</a>, which aims to accelerate the development of direct brain-to-machine interfaces.</p>
<p>It's impossible to know the extent to which Urban's account actually reflects Neuralink's plans. It's built on the kind of homunculus-riddled explanations of cognition that one is warned against repeatedly, even in the undergrad classes that make up the entirety of my education on these questions. But from Neuralink's perspective this might be a feature, not a bug: Urban can't have gotten it quite right, so everything is deniable.</p>
<p>To the extent that it <em>is</em> accurate, the essay itself perfectly recapitulates Neuralink's strategy: just as the reader must slog through tens of thousands of unobjectionable words before reaching the punchline, Neuralink's real aims are buried beneath a bunch of shorter-term medical goals that are unquestionably admirable. Sensory prostheses, cures for paralysis--only a monster would object to these. But that's not all they want to do. Ultimately, they want to connect human minds seamlessly to digital communication technologies. Memory and computation would be partially offloaded to computers. Nonverbal forms of interpersonal communication might be possible. Collective forms of cognition could arise.</p>
<p>Given the power of network effects and the pathetically small incidence of technological abstinence in our society (picture a Western teenager without a smartphone) is it plausible that such a change could really be called optional? Can there be any doubt that this would transfigure humanity into something unrecognizable? Can there be any argument that this would constitute the end of our species' current intellectual and cultural history?</p>
<p>And who gets to make this decision, anyway? An overextended Silicon Valley weirdo? His board of venture capitalists? I spent years of my professional life working to transform American political institutions on behalf of a billionaire philanthropist who was so-empowered because he happened to write some early auction software. All I can say in defense of this decisionmaking system is that we were not all that effective.</p>
<p>A good response to this is that there has never been a deliberative process for these sorts of things: humanity blunders into new technologies and always will. The best you can hope for is some queasy retrospective essays about the Manhattan Project. I don't have an alternative to suggest, but I find this insufficient. My sense is that we were enormously lucky that nuclear weapons happened to be developed in cultural and social systems that turned out to have brinksmanship as their equilibrium state (so far, anyway). Our species has occasionally invented societies that do not work that way.</p>
<p>But back to the matter at hand. Naturally, the justification offered for destroying humanity is that this is the only way to save it: Musk says he's worried that we're about to invent vengeful superpowered AI, and that a hivemind superconsciousness is the only path to protecting ourselves. It's hard not to notice that this theory contains a number of things that are optional, unlikely or could simply not work.</p>
<p>Personally, I think a more parsimonious explanation is that Musk suffers from a psychosis by which he finds various science fiction-y ideas utterly irresistible and is compelled to do everything in his power to realize them. I say this with both horror and admiration: if even one of his various non-Hyperloop projects works out, he will have made himself into a figure of world-historical significance. Even if I had the talent to do these sorts of things (obviously I don't), I think the wiser and more ethical path is a family, a career, a home, and then historical oblivion. But it's hard not to marvel at someone who is actually able to live your daydreams.</p>
<p>The crucial difference is that electric cars and solar panels and batteries and rockets and terraforming Mars all seem like good or at least sane ideas. This is not obviously true of Neuralink.</p>
<p>I won't bore you with obvious arguments about such technologies' capacity for totalitarian control or <a class="reference external" href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/11/10/iot_worm_can_hack_philips_hue_lightbulbs_spread_across_cities/">simple</a> <a class="reference external" href="https://www.engadget.com/2017/01/09/fda-warns-that-certain-pacemakers-are-vulnerable-to-hacking/">hacking</a>. Instead I'll ask: how is the electronic communication project looking, do you think?</p>
<p>Brain-to-brain interaction could easily be a singularity-level development, something with consequences that cannot be anticipated. It could even have Fermi Paradox implications! Reasoning about it might be impossible. But apparently we have to, and so we should probably start by asking what has happened over the last century as we learned to use electricity to make communication instantaneous, then digital, then networked.</p>
<p>I'm not sure whether or how to count world wars against being able to Facetime with your grandkid, so let's just call that stuff a wash. I find the very recent history of many-to-many, pan-society frictionless communication to be extremely discouraging. <a class="reference external" href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/04/12/facebook_makes_you_sad/">Social media makes us less happy</a>, as our evolved impulses for status competition and tribalism are supercharged. At a larger scale, the U.S. media and political ecosystem seems to have been successfully manipulated to a mind-boggling conclusion by a foreign power during our last election, <em>despite the fact that the manipulation was detected as it was in progress</em>. We can <a class="reference external" href="http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/4/12/15259438/social-media-political-polarization">quibble</a> about which part of this era of unprecedentedly efficient communication is responsible for our seemingly unstoppable descent into bitter factionalism and individual discontent; whether technologically enabled forms of <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hikikomori">suffering</a> are new or merely more humane substitutes for older torments; whether the humanitarian benefits still being realized by technological diffusion outweigh the ennui that sets in after its arrival. But I don't think many would disagree that the hedonic, intellectual, spiritual and institutional returns to a fully networked contemporary lifestyle are looking pretty suspect.</p>
<p>This is a tragedy. You could not find many people more enthusiastic than my younger self about the cathartic deliverance that perfect communication would provide. I ran a BBS as a kid; I built grandiose, essay-filled websites; I was consumed by technology and absolutely convinced that millennia-old liberal ideals about knowledge and deliberation would finally reach their apotheosis now that an age of universal democratic access was dawning. I count the failure of this vision as one of the great disappointments of my life.</p>
<p>In my younger self's defense: it's still early days. The jury is out on all of this. Yes, we are responding to social media and institutional decentralization badly, but populations sometimes evolve resistance to new pathogens after an initial wave of devastation. It's possible we will develop the cultural practices necessary to avoid the helpless emotional and social debasement that currently pervade a fully wired existence.</p>
<p>(On the other hand that lifestyle still only reaches a tiny fraction of very wealthy people. Things will probably get much worse in the short term.)</p>
<p>I have no idea how this will work out in the future, but it seems obvious that blithely accelerating these processes today is unwise. If we do learn how to endure this changed way of living, I will agree it's a shame that Elon and I will have missed our chance to be a part of its completion. But we all owe each other caution and care on matters this enormous, and maybe this is the cost of that duty. All that history owes us is oblivion. If Elon cannot learn to be content with that, I pity him. But not enough to release him from his responsibility to me.</p>

Configure it, put it in your camera and it can wirelessly upload photos without human intervention. It's a neat gadget, even if I never did manage to get my mother's working for her.</p>
<p>Alas, Eye-fi's software accomplishes this feat by running in the background of an always-on desktop computer. Worse, they've been steadily eroding their services' capabilities, stripping away integration with photosharing sites people actually use in favor of their own cloud photo service (don't worry, the first year is free).</p>
<p>A few intrepid geeks reverse-engineered the early Eye-fi cards, but enthusiasm seems to have diminished as Eye-fi's services changed and their early-gen cards stopped working. Nevertheless, the techniques they discovered and software they wrote still work... well, they almost worked. There were some rough spots.</p>
<p>I have a baby on the way (did I mention that?) and expect to be generating lots of photos. So I have taken one <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/dgrant/eyefiserver2">low-dependency-count open source project</a> and given it a fresh coat of paint. In addition to the satisfaction of knowing you are running slightly more reputable Python, the system is now able to upload your photos to Flickr, if you let it. And it runs in Docker (<a class="reference external" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14156954">renamed as of today to Moby, ugh</a>), which should remove many of the idiosyncratic configuration headaches that would otherwise make sharing a project like this a masochistic declaration of one's intent to provide free tech support, forever.</p>
<p>If any of this sounds useful I hope you'll <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/sbma44/eyefi-docker">give it a look</a>. It has already happily uploaded many debug photos of my coffee table to Flickr from my a household Raspberry Pi. Perhaps it will prove equally helpful to you.</p>

                    <p>I got horribly sick around 10pm on Thanksgiving night. It wasn't the food (no one else got sick) but by early afternoon the next day I was in the ER getting IV fluids and a CT scan to ensure my appendix was in one piece. It was! But the rest of the stuff in there remained unhappy and I didn't eat anything but gatorade and two bananas for the next 48 hours. I'm feeling much better now but the recovery process has involved watching a hell of a lot of TV. Which reminded me of something I've been meaning to write about for a long time. Specifically: the cultural salience of the CBS primetime lineup. It's the key to everything. Bear with me.</p>
<p>CBS's loud claims to being America's top network need to be taken with a grain of salt. The numbers are actually pretty close, and the rankings switch around if you start removing sports from the equation. Still, their shows are indisputably popular. And indisputably stupid. Very, very stupid. This is the network that made America's top comedy a show defined by the catchphrase &quot;Bazinga!&quot; -- a detail so on-the-nose that it reads like Pynchon losing a step.</p>
<p>The strategy is boringly obvious: lowest common denominator. Some of this is simple, like cloning successful formulae into new franchise spinoffs or using the hoariest TV tropes (their newest show's tagline: &quot;he's not a lawyer -- he's a trial consultant&quot;). Normally this is merely banal and unworthy of notice. But now, in a year when we've all learned some horrifying things about what appeals to the masses, I find myself pondering what else they might like.</p>
<p>Identifiability is clearly important to these shows' success. Leads wear casual clothing and are often unshaven. They are not cerebral except when they are specifically meant to be nerds. Credentials are never mentioned (well, except badges). Not to be unkind, but there are quite a lot of fat people. <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cbs.com/shows/mike_and_molly/">Some shows</a> seem specifically engineered to have no distinguishing characteristics <em>except</em> a cast as heavy as its audience. For a long time I couldn't figure out why a formerly cut-up action star like Chris O'Donnell led a top action series behind a doughy torso and loose neckline. Now I think it might be more of a feature than a bug. These are shows for an audience that has let itself go. Or has had to.</p>
<p>It's also a set of shows expressing personal dynamics so anachronistically conventional that it feels like they must be there specifically for reassurance. The shows are overwhelmingly white, but then it's not uncommon for television networks to target racially-defined audiences. The treatment of women is sexist -- plenty of comments about how sexy everyone is -- but always with plausible deniability (it's mostly villains or rakish one-off characters making the remarks). Slightly more unusual is the frequency with which these series are anchored by a somewhat weatherbeaten white guy who's generationally separate from the rest of the cast. I take this to be a promise to an aging audience that virility hasn't left them entirely behind. That they're still in charge.</p>
<p>But this is so much pointy-headed snobbery. Less important than how the viewers see themselves is how they see the world.</p>
<p>There is a larger military presence on CBS than the other networks combined. So many characters who used to be in the service; not too long ago, so many shows structured around weirdly civilian corners of the armed forces. Arguably this is merely a twist on TV's love of police departments as a means of structuring four acts and a teaser: martial rather than municipal. Still, pair it with an utterly blase attitude toward and presumption of omnipresent surveillance, and it all starts to feel a little authoritarian and bad.</p>
<p>Finally, while I think the moment has passed, I got started on this line of thought during the burst of forensic investigator shows--CSI, Bones et al. Some of this is just the usual network copycattery. Still, it's remarkable to see America fall in love with shows obsessed with human remains as religious affiliation (and, presumably, belief in an afterlife) falls off a cliff. CSI debuted in 2000; the correlation with this <a class="reference external" href="http://religionnews.com/2014/01/27/great-decline-religion-united-states-one-graph/">methodologically questionable</a> index is probably too good to be true. But the broader trend is <a class="reference external" href="http://www.pewforum.org/2015/11/03/u-s-public-becoming-less-religious/">hard to deny</a>.</p>
<p>I don't have any grand observations to make about all of this. That's probably why it's never made it past the drafts folder before now. Still, it's striking how different media looks when it's only courting an audience, only chasing dollars. And winning.</p>
<p>(I should acknowledge that overthinking these shows is not an idea that's wholly mine. Years ago my friend Matt tried to pitch a TV recap series about the top (dumb) broadcast shows at work, as a fun differentiator from the overwhelming mass of prestige cable recaps. Alas, I understand it went nowhere. I was already noodling on some crackpot theories about the above but his argument made me resolve to write them down... someday. It's worth mentioning that CBS shows' dialogue and the marketing specifically recapitulates <a class="reference external" href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2013/05/28/fast_and_furious_economics.html">his thesis about the family unit's renewed primacy in entertainment</a>.)</p>

                    <p>Steph and I have been AirBnBing our guest bedroom for about a year and a half now, and it's been mostly great. It's not a ton of extra money, but it's not an insignificant amount, either. We occasionally meet interesting people. We are regularly reminded that the world is full of people unlike ourselves, and that it's possible to get along with them, at least when the interaction is supervised by an app's influential reputation system.</p>
<p>And it seems like it's probably good for us. I love my job dearly, but it does involve a lot of playing with computers and eating free snacks. Spending a few hours a month scrubbing toilets for money makes me feel like I might have at least a slim chance of surviving the revolution.</p>
<p>The aforementioned reputation system does a good job of driving nearly everyone within it toward neurotic approval-seeking. You are not just supplying a service for money; you are also hoping your guests will have a good time and compliment your home and be impressed with your lifestyle. They are not just paying for lodging; they are trying not to be a bother and giving you coffee from their home country and making implausible offers to put you up if you ever visit COUNTRY/CITY X. It's all a little bit charming and let's be honest more than a little pathetic, but the five-star ratings really do seem to weed out the sociopaths. It works pretty well.</p>
<p>Despite their business being built on overeager social fumbling, AirBnB is taking steps to make interactions more impersonal through the use of their <em>Instant Book</em> feature, by which hosts relinquish their ability to approve requests from prospective guests one by one. They have both good and bad reasons for this. Good, in that there is strong evidence of racial and no doubt other forms of iniquity in how hosts accept guests. Bad, in that they were pushing Instant Book well before the bias conversation, presumably because lowering coordination costs leads to more transactions and revenue.</p>
<p>I am in favor of systematizing away opportunities for human odiousness, but Steph and I are unlikely to enable Instant Book. In our experience, the worst AirBnB interactions occur when expectations are mismatched. A first-time user with poor English expects to get a full condo, rather than just a room, for eighty bucks a night. A high school kid from suburban Maryland expects to stay at our place with his girlfriend. A couple of friends expect a third to maybe join their weekend trip on a whim and crash on our living room couch. A new graduate's parents have never been out of China before and expect to order room service. Or maybe Steph and I just have an inkling of plans for a week we haven't thought to block off yet. Reviewing potential guests allowed us to avoid several of these catastrophes. Plus the silly letter the guest has to compose gets the stilted courtship described above off on the right foot.</p>
<p>Most guests are nice but boring folks. They typically hole up in the room they've let and do their thing without much bother. We have learned to identify risk factors for those who will spend a bunch of time at home (when they do this you have to pretend not to mind):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Those at the end of very long trips will be exhausted and will just want to surf the web rather than continuing to fake enthusiasm for seeing cultural treasures or whatever.</li>
<li>The young will be too poor to spend time outside of the house except for whatever their Big Planned Event is. Also their blase attitude toward their creeping mortality makes them feel like they have all the time in the world to visit the National Archives someday, but you know what, young man, you don't.</li>
<li>The old, particularly those who have clearly been dragged along by their spouses, might just want to watch TV, which in our household often requires moderate-to-advanced skill at TCP/IP network configuration. We try our best but some of them don't even know how to run a traceroute.</li>
</ul>
<p>We have been charmed by several guests. There was the Parisian atmospheric scientist who flew planes to take air samples, who Steph still pines for. There was the bartender who was back to take the bar for the third time after missing the date for the one near his home in New York City. There was the Eastern European flight attendant who met his internet language-learning community girlfriend for the first time in our house on Valentine's Day, followed her home to Southeastern Virginia, proposed, was not allowed to meet her family, flew home without a ring or engagement, and was still so polite as to respond to our thirsty AirBnB requests for details about how it all went. I think fondly of all of them.</p>
<p>But if I were to offer only one piece of advice about how to charm your AirBnB host it would have to be this: try not to leave too much hair behind. Honestly, this is all I care about. Maybe avoid putting wet garbage in the bin, too, so I can reuse the liner after I empty it. Otherwise, go nuts. My dream guests are an aging and profoundly bald gay couple. No stray hairs, in bed at a reasonable hour, and maybe they can tell us some good stories over a glass of wine. God bless them.</p>
<p>If you are considering AirBnB hosting, I have a longer list of suggestions:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Consider the cost of room turnover and the cost of guests letting their guard down and beginning to transgress boundaries. For us this means bookings of 3-5 nights, which is a narrow window that probably hurts earnings but minimizes stress.</li>
<li>Use AirBnB's free photography service. It makes your place look great, though it can take a while to get an appointment and our listing makes it look like we have a Christmas tree up year-round.</li>
<li>Buy some <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/Epielle-Argan-Oil-Makeup-Remover-Cleaning-Tissues-Wipes-30-Counts-Pack-of-2-/111861639785?hash=item1a0b792a69:g:XbwAAOSw5IJWgttD">makeup removal wipes</a> and leave them in a prominent spot, or else you will eventually wind up with some destroyed towels. The first time you see a guest heading out for the evening in unexpectedly high heels you should immediately buy another towel set on Amazon.</li>
<li>Get some programmable door locks or a <a class="reference external" href="https://www.amazon.com/Master-Lock-5400D-Set-Your-Own-Combination/dp/B0002YP1VC/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1473911723&amp;sr=8-4&amp;keywords=key+lock+box+combination">key lock box</a>, obviously. Alternately, prepare yourself to get upset over guests not respecting your arrival policies. You will be irate but they will not understand the problem at all, like a dog getting yelled at for drinking out of the toilet. It's water, isn't it? I don't see what the big deal is.</li>
<li>Ask existing hosts for testimonials to get over the &quot;is this new listing a scam that will steal my kidneys&quot; hump.</li>
<li>If your guest shower has a hose sprayer, great, bully for you. If not, get <a class="reference external" href="https://www.amazon.com/Rinse-Ace-3025-Quick-Connect-Detachable/dp/B00474UALE/ref=pd_sim_60_2?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=11QCRJ8AAJK7TXD9GR73">one of these things</a>. It will make your bathroom cleaning so, so much faster. A little handheld vacuum is also a substantial time-saver.</li>
<li>It's maybe overkill but we installed some <a class="reference external" href="https://www.amazon.com/Enerlites-Countdown-Ventilation-1-5-10-15-20-30-REQUIRED/dp/B00IB0ZJXE/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1473911924&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=timer+fan+control">fan timers</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.amazon.com/TOPGREENER-TU2152A-Charger-Resistant-Receptacle/dp/B01J6JJD8A/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1473911943&amp;sr=8-1-spons&amp;keywords=usb+outlet&amp;psc=1">USB outlets</a> to encourage non-moldy bathrooms and fewer questions about borrowing chargers.</li>
<li>We've found that guests leave reviews about how much they like having a good neighborhood guide, a comfy bed, immaculately clean bathrooms and an electric kettle in the room. They don't seem to care about the cheap Trader Joe's wine we gave away for a while. I guess we weren't fooling them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes we are attentive, sometimes we are busy, sometimes we are maybe even a little surly. The guests don't seem to notice. The AirBnB review is by now a well-understood compositional form. Give them a fair deal and they will write you one, like a traveling bard composing a song. You'll meet some strangers and it'll basically be okay, sometimes a little worse but often better than you'd think.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>A week ago I was in Las Vegas, surrounded by thousands of people attending Black Hat and DEF CON, the computer security industry's two most important US gatherings. I had never been, and I loved it. I loved it.</p>
<p>What could be more hyperbolic than an army of hackers building a hive within Las Vegas, a place that is already a cartoonish, predatory and vacuum-sealed daydream? We have all watched decades of hacker movies and shitty quasi-martial CBS procedurals where geeks have piercings and weird hair and (when in front of a keyboard) superpowers. My expectations had been set by portrayals I knew to be bad. Surely the reality would be different, which is a euphemism adults use for &quot;disappointing&quot;.</p>
<p>But it wasn't. It was a wonderland. Those production designers did a better job than I thought. And the superpowers are real, albeit demanding of much more time and tedious scrutiny of IDA Pro output than can comfortably fit in three acts and 46 minutes. But I'm getting ahead of myself.</p>
<p>I did not understand the difference between Black Hat and DEF CON before going. Black Hat is more professional, I had heard. DEF CON is cheaper. A lot of the same people go to both. All of this is true, but it's a shallow explanation.</p>
<p>Black Hat is an expertly-produced conference for security professionals, a category that includes researchers, software vendors and surely more than a few cybercriminals. Its escalatingly expensive tiers of access allow participation in the frenzied vendor hall; attendance at the &quot;briefings&quot; where new and sometimes dangerous research is presented; and &quot;classes&quot; where specific attacks are taught--to use a not entirely hypothetical example, a fun class exercise might involve bringing Iran's IP address block to its knees for an hour or two.</p>
<p>I was surrounded by khaki pants and polo shirts and a pervasive air of menace. My most vivid memory of the conference is among my first: walking into the keynote, an impossibly vast space even by Vegas's improbable standards. Far above me the ventilation system exhaled a low, cavernous breath. The only light came from the projection screens that relayed the distant speaker's image, bright like windows in a spaceship orbiting a blue-white star. By that light I could make out the silhouettes of the audience, thousands and thousands of them sitting in shadow, waiting to learn something new and frightening. You don't take photos of other people at Black Hat, but in a room like that it would be hard, anyway: they're not even lit by their own screens. Bringing a computer into such a hostile network environment is considered by most not to be worth the risk. I've never seen fewer computers in a conference audience than at this computer security conference. Everyone there learned long ago that if you are in the business of having prey you are also in the business of being still and unnoticed.</p>
<p>It freaked me out. Black Hat's lightning talk track is called &quot;Arsenal&quot;; on Twitter, observers complained about talks that didn't come with working code. This is not an academic conference.</p>
<p>DEF CON begins as Black Hat ends, and it is fundamentally a social gathering. The Black Hat attendees slip into a less stony kind of crypsis, cheerfully blending in with people whose skills and interests are similar to theirs but who possess vastly less discipline. Things become a lot more fun. $240 -- cash only -- at the considerably seedier Bally's got me a skull-shaped electronic entry badge with ciphertext printed across it, connection pins that would whisper more secrets if hooked to the right hardware, and absolutely no instructions. If you <a class="reference external" href="http://co9.io/post/148716614744/defcon-24-badge-challenge">solve the puzzles built into it</a> and the lanyards and the conference signs and the schedule booklet and a hidden subdirectory on the welcome CD-ROM and who knows what else, you win free entry for life.</p>
<p>This was just one of <a class="reference external" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=defcon+24+badges&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwibl4T1usHOAhUDax4KHWAqBhoQsAQIOw&amp;biw=1357&amp;bih=803">many badges</a>. I stood in line to get a kit that let me build a different badge, this one associated with an annual <a class="reference external" href="https://dcdark.net/home">cyberpunk role-playing game</a>. I soldered it together at the hardware hacking village's free workstations; afterward I could use its infrared LEDs to trade handles with other players, then send them radio messages. There were badges that could connect to your car's diagnostic network, badges for the LGBTQ and women-focused subcons, and badges made by groups of friends where you just had to know a guy to get one. They blinked LEDs, and paired with each other, and had secret accessories.</p>
<p>The badges are only a small part of the con, though. In a little over 48 hours I learned about beating airport wifi portals, lockpicking, dumping and decompiling router firmware, messing with tamper-evident seals and hacking Italian parking meters. The vendor hall was full of booths devoted to hawking t-shirts rather than to collecting CISO emails; I bought gadgets to let me spy on Bluetooth network traffic and a USB thumbdrive that injects exploit code at a thousand characters per second. Around midnight on Friday I found myself in safety glasses, a nylon net cage, a 26th floor suite, and a state of considerable intoxication, all at once, as I prepared to pilot a drone against three other people vying to be the first to pop a balloon at the cage's center. Across the hall you could get an RFID chip implanted in your hand for $60.</p>
<p>I was jealous of the kids whose parents had brought them. They were finding this place so early. There is a certain type of person with certain types of interests and this is where they occasionally gather, like migratory animals, for those rare experiences unmediated by LCD screens.</p>
<p>My ebullience at finding so many people of the same type as myself powered me through most of the weekend. But at some point I had to start asking myself what type of person that was, exactly.</p>
<p>On Saturday my badge was malfunctioning. It wouldn't blink the way it was supposed to. I had no relevant tools to tinker with, and was eventually referred up to one group's suite for help. There an exhausted man behind a mountain of soldering equipment and several empty Surge tallboys was explaining, to a semicircle of my fellow newbies, how he had designed and thought about the group's badge. No, the group wouldn't accept sponsorship, he said. They paid for it out of their own pockets. To get a badge you had to be cool, that was it. They never had as many to give away as they would like. He didn't want to see them in the hands of certain people, people whose names I had never heard of but which he practically spat. No, this wasn't his day job, he--he trailed off. &quot;I don't make a lot of money,&quot; he said, breaking eye contact.</p>
<p>He was generous with me, and after attending to a long line of questions and requests for aid that had arrived ahead of me, he performed a simple diagnostic test and declared, reasonably, that the repairs I needed were beyond the tools he had present.</p>
<p>It was about five minutes into our interaction before I realized he was open-carrying a glock on his hip. That's the kind that doesn't have a safety. This made me pretty uncomfortable, but of course I didn't say anything. I was his guest, in his and his friends' suite. I thanked him earnestly and honestly and left to find someone else to help me with my badge.</p>
<p>That gun was jarring to me, but maybe it shouldn't have been. What are all of these exploits, these network packet captures, these lockpicking sessions about, anyway, if not having power over others? All of us there wanted secret knowledge to make ourselves stronger. For some it's because we can't forget being weak before. For others it's probably something uglier. But it's hard for me to imagine any of it being born of an impulse that's particularly noble.</p>
<p>At best, it can be enough to know when you have gained that strength, to limit its expression to sly winks and low-grade mischief shared with the similarly afflicted. That's DEF CON. If you begin using that new strength for a living, or find yourself forced to face the people who do--Black Hat. Worse things, if you ask me.</p>
<p>Well, I might find its emotional foundation suspect, but DEF CON was a hell of a lot of fun, and I will be back. Eventually, I'd like to better understand why I want to go so badly. But my short-term goal is just to get faster with my new lockpicks.</p>

                    <p><em>None of the following will be of much interest to people already familiar with OSM, except perhaps as an opportunity to take offense. The internet has plenty of those; I encourage you to trust me when I say that I mean no disrespect. I offer this both to satisfy my own commitment to write more and because I've recently been thinking that saying things that seem obvious can be important. Sometimes they turn out not to be that obvious after all.</em></p>
<p>Mike Migurski has <a class="reference external" href="http://mike.teczno.com/notes/openstreetmap-at-a-crossroads.html">a characteristically thoughtful post</a> about OpenStreetMap and how he feels the community must adapt to be more welcoming of automated edits (&quot;robot mappers&quot;) and communities focused on improving the map for emergency response (&quot;crisis mappers&quot;). He characterizes the interests of these communities as being at odds with the original participants in OpenStreetMap, which he names &quot;craft mappers&quot;.</p>
<p>In comments, several OSM doyens object to this characterization even while betraying some of its truth: Frederik Ramm cops to the project's import as a social mechanism, and Richard Fairhurst (who I hasten to add seems like he might be the most reasonable person ever to use the internet) extolls the project as a vehicle for personal expression and empowerment.</p>
<p>One has to admit that this is a bit of stacked deck. Crisis mapping is enormously important but it's also a rhetorical atom bomb. Saving lives is always going to be more important than preserving the hobby of a few map obsessives.</p>
<p>So let me complicate Mike's typology by adding one more constituency: passive users of OpenStreetMap data. Naturally I am thinking of Mapbox customers, but also people using MapQuest and Mapzen and Carto and Maps.me and countless other businesses. It's not entirely clear to me how much the earliest mappers of OSM care about their efforts finding use, or whether they are content to build a beautiful scale model of the world. The project's relative inattention to building consumer-friendly services has always seemed to me an intelligently-chosen strategy of allowing the competitive market to handle distributing the project's achievements. But I suppose indifference is an equally plausible explanation.</p>
<p>Still, I don't think there can be any doubt that an enormous number of people benefit from OSM as mediated by commercial entities like Mapbox. Anyone who owns a smartphone can understand the growing importance of geodata. Finding the nearest coffeeshop is a modest benefit compared to being pulled from a collapsed building by rescue workers, but it happens considerably more often. It's reasonable to be wary of equating profit with good, but commerce generally does indicate that someone is having their needs or wants satisfied. And there's plenty of money in maps.</p>
<p>This community has no meaningful franchise within OpenStreetMap, and is instead represented by the commercial actors who serve them (:waves:). Those actors command both the resources and resentment you might expect of profiteers in a volunteer community: valued for the contributions of effort, software and money that professionalization affords, but viewed with understandable suspicion as to motives. We can do a lot of things, but people are quick to assume that we are doing them for bad reasons.</p>
<p>It is not a very democratic circumstance, but no one claimed otherwise: OpenStreetMap is often referred to as a &quot;do-ocracy&quot;, implying that those who contribute work have outsize influence. Fair enough, but this means that when the work that must be done includes discussion, conflict that amounts to a veto is the overwhelmingly likely outcome.</p>
<p>And that means that stasis is the order of the day. A slowly growing map, best in places where people have enough time and money to support a particular type of eccentric hobbyist. Across from them, another group of professionals, this one anxious to build the map everywhere, and quickly, before the next earthquake or funding round.</p>
<p>Everyone involved is as earnest and passionate as you might imagine, but there are probably only a few hundred of us bothering to write heartfelt blog posts and send snarky tweets from conference sessions. Oblivious to all of this are the overwhelming majority of <a class="reference external" href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Stats#Active_contributors_per_month">the tens of thousands of active mappers</a>; the tens of millions of people using OSM data without knowing it; and the billions of people who could be safer, or richer, or freer if OpenStreetMap or a project like it became the understood commons where we map our shared world.</p>
<p>I think mapping is a great and interesting problem, but it's my job, not my hobby. Perhaps this makes it too easy for me to follow my utilitarian open data beliefs and say that OSM should be built as quickly and unselfishly as possible. But there it is.</p>

                    <p>The road had descended steeply into the valley, and if there was a river anywhere near, it seemed like we would find it soon. There were even a few signs for a dock, but by that time we were suspicious. The people of Skradin would have you believe that their great civic passtime is standing on street corners, wearing t-shirts emblazoned with the letter P and proclaiming the availability of free parking for ferry passengers. It seemed suspicious. Besides, Google told us the ferry was over one more mountain. Nice try, Skradinze.</p>
<p>Our rented VW diesel leapt up the incline, no doubt leaving unimaginable pollutants in its wake. At the bottom of the hill a construction worker made a sort of :no_good: gesture but maybe he was communicating with a colleague behind us? We proceeded onward toward the pin. The road became one way, not too unusual for this part of the world. Some trees were growing into the road; I rolled up my window. Soon the gap became so small that we worried about our mirrors. But the pin urged us on.</p>
<p>Eventually we reached the end of the alley. The walls had closed in. There were a couple of driveways headed up to estates on the hill to our left, so steep that a scooter might tip backward. Backing out looked terrifying: to our right, footpaths ramped down from, then parallel along the road. With no guardrails in evidence, a misplaced wheel could fall into several feet of empty air.</p>
<p>I was panicking, but Steph got out of the car and eventually guided me through a many-, many-point turn (restarted three times). The owner of an adjacent house looked on disapprovingly, convinced with good reason that an idiot was about to crash into her house at low speed.</p>
<p>Obviously you should not ask me for advice about driving when abroad. But thanks to work I can tell you exactly why this happened, and how you can spot the circumstances that might produce similar predicaments for you.</p>
<p>We had geocoded the ferry, plopping its address into an app's text field and relying on the location to which it was matched. Results from such a service can be divided into two levels of quality: <em>address point</em> and <em>interpolated</em>.</p>
<p>Point geocoding works the way you might imagine. If you put in &quot;150 Main Street&quot;, the system finds the coordinates associated with the building at that address and returns them. Exactly what that spot represents can vary. Sometimes it represents the land parcel, sometimes the building's rooftop, sometimes even the entryway.</p>
<p>Point geocoding results are the best kind. But point geocoding datasets are never comprehensive. People build new structures all the time, and it's hard to drop pins for them all in a prompt manner, particularly since address numbers aren't visible from satellite imagery.</p>
<p>So virtually all geocoders fall back to interpolation when they can't find a point to match a query. An interpolated dataset includes a map of road network line segments. Each segment record has the road's name, a start and end number, and whether the odd-numbered addresses go on its right or left side. This lets the system make an informed guess about an address location when no point is available. If a segment named &quot;Main Street&quot; starts at 100 and ends at 200, then a query for &quot;150 Main Street&quot; will be placed at its middle.</p>
<p>This works well a lot of the time. But of course addresses are not spaced perfectly evenly along roads. Some buildings are wider or thinner than their neighbors. Some blocks have several buildings clustered at one end, followed by empty space.</p>
<p>Geocoding data like this is often collected by state or municipal authorities and stitched together into national and international datasets. Those authorities collect it for different reasons: taxes or emergency services or road maintenance, for instance. So it's common to have the level of quality vary by location even within a single country or region.</p>
<p>And quality tends to be worse in rural areas. There are fewer government agencies managing and maybe-digitizing those places. Businesses can't make as much profit from those areas, so there's less money sloshing around to fix problems. And everything is spread out: a so-so interpolation result can be off by a few hundred feet on a city block, or several miles along a farm road.</p>
<p>The interpolation data for our Croatian ferry terminal just wasn't very good. And there probably wasn't any data at all for the small houses that I nearly drove into.</p>
<p>In the abstract, this might not be of much interest to people who don't work on geocoders all day. But it's worth keeping in mind for your next vacation: if you get a result that doesn't land on a rooftop, it might pay to be suspicious of the next results, too. At the very least, I recommend paying close attention to any non-obscene gestures that you see construction workers making.</p>

                    <p>I rode my bicycle a hundred miles yesterday, and so yes, this is mostly an extended humble-brag. But it is also a mark of how much has changed since <a class="reference external" href="/2012/09/29/beautiful-and-fast/">my first, ecstatic road bike experience</a>.</p>
<p>A down pedalstroke no longer seems to make the ground leap past me, and my legs no longer feel like springs ready to launch. In retrospect, I got what I wished for in that post, a melding of body and bicycle: a fall two years ago means my collarbone is now built with lightweight, precisely-machined titanium (alas, my bike frame is still mere aluminum). Having wishes granted is fraught.</p>
<p>But I still love being on a bike, and I understand it a bit better than I did. Certainly I understand my limitations better: I am not built to be a great cyclist. Too many college days in the gym, adding muscle to protect myself for an awkward but already-concluded adolescence. These days too much mass, period. The great cyclists are hugely tall and nearly skeletal, save for the enormous engines of muscle between their knees and hips. I'm not built like that.</p>
<p>More interesting than that is the revelation of a body's limits. This is Charles' insight, really. But a bicycle makes it easy to understand yourself as a machine, to deplete your metabolism before breaking your body in a away that's hard to achieve when running or doing most other athletic things. The air cools you and there's little stress on your joints. You can adjust gearing to manipulate the difficulty of the task. Really, you can just keep going until you run out of fuel. If you forget to feed yourself every 20 miles or so, you will fall to pieces, but the brief delay of digestion makes it hard to remember this. Which is why I bonked around mile 60, shortly after we had climbed Sugarloaf Mountain.</p>
<p>Well, no matter. Matt and Charles were patient with me as we stopped in the shade near a park, and a few miles later we sat down to lunch at a restaurant in Poolesville. I consumed a digusting amount of Coca-Cola at a pace exceeded only by my heart rate, which refused to slow down. I ate my club sandwich so fast that my throat still hurts today. Afterward I felt a lot better.</p>
<p>The last 40 miles were not pleasant, exactly--the human butt is not meant to sit on a saddle for that length of time, and a pinched nerve in my neck meant that the skin at the top of my back was numb until this morning. But I took better, steadier care of myself after lunch, and arrived home with an odometer showing a distressing 94.5 miles.</p>
<p>Steph had gotten me some century-related birthday gifts two years before, but schedules and injury had made it impossible. This was a long-deferred goal. Matt had promised an 85 mile ride, which we had (accidentally) exceeded. And Charles had headed down to Hanes point when we reached 15th Street to put in the necessary laps to hit three digits.</p>
<p>So I trundled up and down the Met Branch Trail a few times, watched my bike computer font get the smallest it'll ever be, then laid down on my living room floor for an hour. Today I feel fine, though I can't tell if it's good or bad that the impact on my knees, butt and neck seem to be the same for a 40 mile ride and a 100 mile trip.</p>

                    <p>I am already failing badly at Iron Blogger. Should I hit publish on that post in <em>drafts</em> that I wrote months ago but which might upset my family? Is that valuable self-expression or just narcissism?</p>
<p>Well, we're going to ignore that question for another week, because it turns out I haven't introduced you to my shed.</p>
<p>Some of you may not realize this, but when you get close to completing the process of purchasing a house your realtor will prompt you to issue some ridiculous demands to the seller, as if you have encountered an unusually boring genie. Typically your request will be for a novelty appliance the seller secretly regrets purchasing, or maybe some furniture. It's considered impolite to ask for pets, and requests for children should only be attempted when buying from particularly large families.</p>
<p>Well, Steph and I asked to build a shed. The place came with a parking spot, but we don't have a car or much desire to haul our bikes up a flight of stairs every day. The building is a duplex, so we had to get the neighbors' okay to build a hulking bike receptable. They are kind people and, better still, maybe did not quite realize what they were agreeing to.</p>
<p>We built a mighty shed, thanks in large part to help from Charles, Kriston and Ben. And yes, we used a kit. But that was just the beginning.</p>
<p><img alt="image1" class="center" src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7432/27172377843_68693715d7_d.jpg" /></p>
<p>First, the physical security layer. Some steel pipe, threadlock, wood screws and creative reuse of the &quot;SOLD&quot; sign our realtor repeatedly failed to pick up produced a serviceable indoor bike rack.</p>
<p><img alt="bike rack" class="center" src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7101/27749075356_c3f9f09b51_d.jpg" /></p>
<p>But obviously my heart lies with the electronics.</p>
<p><img alt="led strips and infrared sensor" class="center" src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7351/27708809331_349b28d807_d.jpg" /></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/5M-3528-5050-RGB-300-SMD-Flexible-LED-Strip-Light-44key-Remote-12V-Power-Supply-/311428103508?var=610488541894&amp;hash=item48828fbd54:m:mvMj5kRkoi-JS2yUS_AD3Xg">LED strips</a> are affordable and already have resistors and adhesive backing in place. All you need to do is supply twelve volts. That happens to be the voltage of most automotive and marine electrical systems, and consequently also a lot of battery technology. But more on that in a second.</p>
<p>The white dome zip-tied to the cross bar is a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/HC-SR501-PIR-Motion-sensor-Passive-Infrared-IR-for-Arduino-Fast-USA-seller-/122019991428?hash=item1c68f54f84:g:1m0AAOSwB4NWw9dv">passive infrared motion sensor</a>. For $3, it works surprisingly well. The cable running up from there goes to a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/20pcs-Photoresistor-5MM-GL5537-LDR-Photo-Resistors-Light-Dependent-Resistor-/321890567952?hash=item4af22c4710:g:EdcAAOSw~bFWGn5w">photoresistor</a>. The apex of the shed's roof is made of translucent plastic to provide illumination during the day. The photoresistor and motion sensor ensure that the lighting system only activates when someone is in the shed and it's dark out.</p>
<p><img alt="arduino/solar controller" class="center" src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7612/27172374493_818624abb9_d.jpg" /></p>
<p>This gadgetry runs down to an Arduino and associated hardware like a MOSFET, a comparator, a trim pot. The Arduino spends most of its life asleep, consuming as little power as possible. But it wakes up a few times a second to see if there's any business it needs to attend to.</p>
<p>Above it is the solar charge controller. That's the gadget that sits between the solar panel and battery and the things you're powering with both. <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/1PC-20A-12V-24V-Solar-Panel-Charge-Controller-Battery-Regulator-Safe-Protection-/231642840036?hash=item35eefd3be4:g:GRMAAOSw3xJVVXT8">This is a particularly cheap and crappy controller</a>, but it seems to work fine. It's connected to a sealed lead acid battery on the floor and, on the roof:</p>
<p><img alt="shed roof" class="center" src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7526/27708811911_4e59109788_d.jpg" /></p>
<p>This guy. My eBay history says I paid $50 for a 20 watt panel back in 2014. Honestly, it's hard to find units rated for so little power these days. But this is about enough to keep the battery topped up. The arrangement works well, though on the coldest days of winter I've learned I need to take the battery inside to keep it from freezing and suffering permanent damage.</p>
<p>The final ingredient is <a class="reference external" href="https://www.amazon.com/GE-45117-Deluxe-Wireless-Alarm/dp/B0014A4JWU/ref=pd_sim_60_1?ie=UTF8&amp;dpID=31Wuglc1e4L&amp;dpSrc=sims&amp;preST=_AC_UL160_SR123%2C160_&amp;refRID=3KQXRA9QXM8X7X21HTKM">an underwhelming electronic door lock</a>. It wouldn't survive an intruder's boot heel for more than a stomp or two, but it might make enough ear-splitting noise before then to alert us. I have an old fire alarm bell from <a class="reference external" href="http://communityforklift.org/">Community Forklift</a> and an <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/MFRC-522-RC522-RFID-Radiofrequency-IC-Card-Inducing-Sensor-Reader-for-Arduino-BE-/191371999374?hash=item2c8ea8f88e:g:igAAAOxyBjBTRMCs">RFID module</a> waiting to be installed. But not every project can be a shed project.</p>
<p>If only it could! But they aren't all winners. Shed telemetry, in particular, has proven tricky:</p>
<p><img alt="temp sensor" class="center" src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7349/27682801972_5a45c3971b.jpg" /></p>
<p>The obvious need for real-time shed temperature readings, published to the internet, can no longer be ignored. But doing this without draining the battery turns out to be tricky. I've got some new <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/1PCS-D1-Mini-NodeMcu-4M-bytes-Lua-WIFI-Development-Board-ESP8266-by-WeMos-TMPP-/222153641786?hash=item33b9638f3a:g:rAwAAOSwMNxXWknT">ESP8266 Arduino clones</a> in hand. If shed telemetry proves to be viable, you'll be among the first to hear about it.</p>

                    <p>UBI is getting a ton of attention these days, and on the whole I'm glad. Smart people I know who care deeply about social welfare have been quietly nursing this dream for a long time, and I respect the depth of their thought and commitment. One friend is even writing a book about UBI! I would like to see a greater share of society's wealth go to the poor, and this seems like a mechanism for achieving that goal that is worth investigating.</p>
<p>This is not to say that I'm a believer. Untested ideas for social improvement generally look pretty good compared to the ones we've actually implemented, which have somehow all turned out to be complicated and horrible. And I've known enough people with serious problems to call myself a paternalist without discomfort. The dignity of financial self-determination sounds great on paper, and saying that some people can't handle it does not. Alas, personal experience has made the latter conclusion inescapable to me.</p>
<p>But I don't want to talk about that today. Really, I want to talk about the deeply silly people from my own culture who are driving this policy moment. The nerds have discovered UBI.</p>
<p>There's no better spot to observe this phenomenon than <a class="reference external" href="https://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a>, a site that shares Reddit's basic worldview but is more brainy, shy, and -- thank goodness -- ashamed of its sexuality. HN is great because threads about, say, astrophotometry fill up with people whose PhD theses were about a _similar_ kind of laser, and they think the way these researchers cooled the dielectric here is really quite clever. It's terrible because basically everything else is about Soylent or Bitcoin or buying Soylent with Bitcoin.</p>
<p>(Okay, that's a cheap shot. These days it's about how you could write Ethereum blockchain contracts to distribute Soylent.)</p>
<p>HN is populated with smart people who work at software startups, most of whom live in the Bay area. Many of them are <em>very</em> excited about UBI. There are <a class="reference external" href="https://hn.algolia.com/?query=basic%20income&amp;sort=byPopularity&amp;prefix&amp;page=0&amp;dateRange=all&amp;type=story">nineteen pages of results for the first relevant phrase I tried</a>. It has become a subject of sufficient fascination in the community that Y Combinator, the incubator that birthed and maintains Hacker News, is investing in a series of experiments to evaluate UBI's viability. <a class="reference external" href="http://blog.ycombinator.com/moving-forward-on-basic-income">They just announced their first UBI director and pilot program, in fact</a>.</p>
<p>This is all to the good. Wealthy people are going to give some money to poorer people to see if it helps them. I bet it will! Good for them.</p>
<p>But at the risk of ruining a good thing, I can't help wondering why my fellow software developers find this idea so interesting. From that post:</p>
<blockquote>
One reason we think it may work is that technological improvements should generate an abundance of resources. Although basic income seems fiscally challenging today, in a world where technology replaces existing jobs and basic income becomes necessary, technological improvements should generate an abundance of resources and the cost of living should fall dramatically.</blockquote>
<p>When Sam says &quot;technological improvements&quot;, I don't think he means better cookstoves in rural China. I suspect he means the kind of stuff that Y Combinator is funding. Software stuff, mostly -- probably a bunch of machine learning projects that promise to <a class="reference external" href="/2015/07/27/rotation-is-great-but-someday-machines-will-do-something-else-itll-be-amazing/">finally invent a machine that does more than rotate</a>, plus maybe one or two discount-rate materials science startups (I hear you can make quantum dots in room temperature water these days).</p>
<p>He might be right! But even if he's not, what <em>glorious hubris</em>.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Imagine meeting a child running a lemonade stand. She's proud of her lemonade, and why not?</p>
<p>&quot;In fact,&quot; she says, &quot;I think there's a pretty good chance that this lemonade is going to be the only thing that people drink from now on. I mean try it.&quot;</p>
<p>You do. You have to admit it's pretty good.</p>
<p>&quot;On the whole I'm excited and humbled to have finally solved the beverage problem. But it won't be an easy transition for everyone! I mean, for me it will be, I'll be fabulously wealthy, ha ha.&quot;</p>
<p>It seems polite to join in the laughter so you do.</p>
<p>&quot;So I've been thinking,&quot; she continues, &quot;That the responsible thing to do is to invest a portion of my profits into researching how to remediate those negative effects. If I don't, I think it's pretty likely that the children of soda manufacturers, for example, will wind up dying in the streets. And before they die, they could riot. It would be hugely disruptive.&quot;</p>
<p>You remark that that sounds like it would be bad for business. She locks eyes with you with a sudden intensity, in way that inescapably says: <em>I knew you would understand.</em></p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Imagine thinking you and your buddies are so smart that your efforts are going to make most other human endeavor pointless. It must be sort of overwhelming. I'd probably feel compelled to hire a postdoc to do something about it, too.</p>
<p>Obviously this is not the only reason people support UBI. It's not even the only reason people in the software industry support UBI! But, knowing human nature and my industry's hilarious track record at introspection, I do think it's possible -- juuuust possible -- that some programmers have been driven by self-regard into a historical materialist analysis under which their superior intelligence transforms society and creates a permanent, pitiable underclass. UBI is both a compassionate response to this sad calculus and, coincidentally enough, a mechanism by which the vast majority of our fortunes and lifestyles can escape disruption.</p>
<p>Well, I wish us all luck. <a class="reference external" href="http://www.vox.com/2015/7/27/9038829/automation-myth">At the moment there is no reason to believe that any of this is happening whatsoever</a>. But it does seem like the robot car thing might work out.</p>
<p>Still, if you're worried about the technology industry further immiserating the poor, I would pay less attention to Uber ordering LIDAR units and more to them <a class="reference external" href="https://get.uber.com/cl/financing/">inviting their drivers to finance their vehicles</a> instead of spending capital on a fleet. I agree that autonomous applications driven by deep learning models written in TensorFlow are much more exciting, but if you really want to avoid screwing over the little guy, Excel spreadsheets are probably the first place to look.</p>

<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p><p>Well, you asked for it.</p>
<p>Screen scraping is the automated collection of information from the web. For our purposes, let's assume it's public information. Stuff you can load in your web browser, using an incognito window and a pasted URL. Stuff meant for ungated human consumption.</p>
<p>When might it be unethical to systematically collect this information, which is being published freely? I can think of a few scenarios that might qualify. If your use of the resource makes it unavailable to others, that might be unethical. This could happen if you hammer the server, but it could also happen if you mirror and resell a database that someone has spent money amassing and maintaining, undercutting them and destroying the model that sustains the resource for others.</p>
<p>What if the owner simply doesn't like the way in which you use their information? Some people think this is a workable way of limiting how information is used. For example, they feel that public tweets shouldn't be quoted by journalists if the tweets weren't written with widespread distribution in mind. In a screen scraping context, a realtor site might be fine with you shopping for a home but less excited about your collecting price data to power an analysis of gentrification.</p>
<p>I think that these kinds of implicit rules about how information is used are at best impractical. Well, okay, that's my diplomatic framing. I really think the sentiment is prudish, illiberal and ludicrous. <a class="reference external" href="http://blog.gaiam.com/quotes/authors/thomas-jefferson?page=3">The transfer of knowledge is not zero-sum</a> and we should err on the side of preserving that miraculous quality. But some people do think along opposing lines.</p>
<p>And although there is very little legal support for their idea that such limitations should be the default way that our society works, it's certainly possible to impose arbitrary limits on what people do with information you give to them if you can get them to agree to a contract.</p>
<p>This brings us to screen scraping.</p>
<div class="section" id="you-have-a-right-to-use-information-you-ve-been-told">
<h2>You have a right to use information you've been told</h2>
<p>Liberal society works because facts belong to everyone. Unless you have a very good reason not to, you need to believe in your right to use published information. You need to believe in your right to think and speak freely about the things you have perceived. This is how our civilization works; it's how our minds work; it's how reality works. Don't give up this belief without a fight.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="fuck-their-contracts">
<h2>Fuck their contracts</h2>
<p>Nearly every website has a terms of service document. These are typically <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_form_contract">contracts of adhesion</a> that say you can't use the site at all unless you agree to a ton of fine print, which will often include a prohibition on automated data collection and probably other things you will do in the normal course of using the web and sustaining belief in a modicum of personal rights. They're also sometimes called &quot;clickwrap&quot; licenses, a rough category of legal agreements that people mindlessly agree to through implicit action when they use software (or when they broke a seal during unwrapping, back when software came in boxes).</p>
<p>This is fundamentally outrageous. You do not enter a contract when you walk into a store or open a book. But the law around websites was born in a later and worse age, when we let them get away with this kind of shenanigan. To a point.</p>
<p>Just because a company puts something in a TOS doesn't mean it's legally enforceable. Google probably can't require you to murder a stranger as a condition of accessing your email, for example. They may not even be able to force Gmail users to permanently forego their right to sue if a self-driving car runs over Fluffy (though Google's lawyers will certainly try). When the fight lands in front of a judge, who will determine which outrageous overreaches are allowable, Google's case will be stronger if its lawyers can prove you read and understood the contract terms prior to violating them. I am not a lawyer, and you should consult a real one rather than relying on my advice. But reading the TOS may not do you any favors.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-cfaa-is-bullshit">
<h2>The CFAA is bullshit</h2>
<p>Outside of any contracts you mistakenly agree to, the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act is the primary vehicle by which scraping might get you into trouble. <a class="reference external" href="https://www.eff.org/issues/cfaa">Let's let the EFF explain</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
The CFAA is the federal anti-hacking law. Among other things, this law makes it illegal to intentionally access a computer without authorization or in excess of authorization; however, the law does not explain what &quot;without authorization&quot; actually means. The statute does attempt to define &quot;exceeds authorized access,&quot; but the meaning of that phrase has been subject to considerable dispute. While the CFAA is primarily a criminal law intended to reduce the instances of malicious hacking, a 1994 amendment to the bill allows for civil actions to be brought under the staute.</blockquote>
<p>This is a stupid, arbitrary law, and you are potentially violating it every time you use the internet. You should be aware that it exists in the same way that you are aware sharks exist. But you shouldn't let them stop you from going in the ocean.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="not-asking-questions-is-a-great-way-to-avoid-dumb-answers">
<h2>Not asking questions is a great way to avoid dumb answers</h2>
<p>This is tricky, I know. If a site operator might be excited about your project, getting their permission might unlock better data, save you time, and avoid subsequent fights. But if they're antagonistic or even just *surprised*, they will instead ask their lawyers how they should respond to your request and their lawyers will (eventually) tell them to say &quot;no&quot;. Then you will have no plausible way to claim that you didn't know you shouldn't collect the information. Worse, the publishers will be on their guard.</p>
<p>If you think the site operator might want to work with you, you should ask for their help. If you're not sure, you should instead ask yourself if you have an ethical claim to the data. The site operator is not necessarily the appropriate arbiter of that question. At <a class="reference external" href="https://sunlightfoundation.com">Sunlight</a> we encountered endless situations where the site operator was not the information's rightful owner. Government sites, hosting public information, with robots.txt files forbidding automated collection? To hell with that. It's wrong.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-stakes-matter">
<h2>The stakes matter</h2>
<p>I say all of the above blithely and confidently, and I think it's good advice for the audience to which the original talk was aimed: journalists. It is decidedly not how I approach these questions in my professional life, at least not these days. I work for a private, for-profit enterprise. We're trying to make money. We have the resources to be careful, to buy licenses, to read contracts, and to be worth suing.</p>
<p>And while I'm proud of how much work our company does to add to the public good, we are not investigative reporters or nonprofit activists. Perhaps more to the point: if we callously take someone else's information and they come after us with a decent argument about it, no one will shed tears for us.</p>
<p>If you are acting on behalf of a corporation, talk to your counsel, then talk to their counsel, then work out an agreement. Take it from Gawker, getting deposed isn't as fun as it sounds.</p>
<p>If you are a journalist, a hobbyist, an activist, or really anyone seeking knowledge rather than wealth: scrape that site. Teach us something. Try not to be a jerk about it. It will probably be fine.</p>

But this is not what the new Star Wars movie is doing. Or I hope it's not.</p>
<p>Retelling a story is one thing, but quoting it is another. <em>The Force Awakens</em> isn't taking the timbers of the original franchise and building a new house around them. It's self-consciously constructing a scale model.</p>
<p>There are two ways to interpret this choice. One is that Disney has cynically decided that the things that fans love and will pay for are incredibly specific moments: lightsabers Force-flying out of snowbanks, father-son showdowns on perilous catwalk bridges, precision bombing runs to disable shield generators. The evidence for this perspective is the numerous otherwise-pointless fanservice notes that movie invokes (the holographic chess game on the Millennium Falcon comes to mind) and the colossal amounts of money at stake.</p>
<p>The other interpretation is that the series' new architects are reestablishing the franchise's structure, rebuilding a framework badly damaged by the careless renovations in the prequels. The only creative advantage to having such structures -- cumbersome, constraining sets of rules and obligations -- is that you can subvert them. The evidence for this is pretty thin, and basically boils down to JJ Abrams not being a hack and everyone involved being smart and rich enough to want to play the long game.</p>
<p>Wishful thinking means I'm leaning toward the second option, hoping for a Rey dark side turn and subversion of the franchise's focus on a small royal family by making Finn the new trilogy's (Force-less) hero. But who knows. <a class="reference external" href="http://www.vox.com/2015/12/22/10641652/star-wars-the-force-awakens-episode-8">As Yglesias says</a>, we won't know if this new movie was good or bad for some time. Sure was fun, though.</p>

                    <p>We had been feeling cross about Uber. This is, by far, the subject about which Steph and I fight the most, as the service's admittedly poor routing prompts different and conflicting reactions from us. She cannot resist reaching across gaping chasms of culture, language and basic navigational competence to put our drivers on the right path. I prefer, in characteristically nonconfrontational style, to quietly abandon myself to fate, gladly surrendering a few hundred meters or cents if it saves everyone some embarrassment.</p>
<p>This was the first Uber we had taken in Paris--hoofing it from Île Saint-Louis to Canal Saint-Martin seemed unappealing, especially since we'd dawdled longer than we'd planned. Mostly the ride was great. Our driver Radhouan spoke no English but was impeccable at piloting a black sedan while wearing a suit and bald head, in exactly the way that people in movies often do before being beaten up by Jason Statham.</p>
<p>Our plan had been to start at the south end of the canal and pick a restaurant as we walked north. Instead, Uber's geocoding dropped us closer to the Porte Sainte-Martin.</p>
<p><p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/23116165665/in/dateposted-public/"><img alt="uber trip in paris :-(" src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/706/23116165665_fa6fa8ef2c_z.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 640px;" /></a></p>
<script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p><p>We walked a few blocks past tiny, packed restaurants, many featuring diners sitting outside under heaters. The neighborhood was clearly cooler and younger than the tourist-filled center of the city where we'd been spending our time.</p>
<p>Soon we reached the canal. I thought it was obvious that most of the restaurants would be south of us, but Steph wanted to go left and I was already in hot water for my poor piloting of the Uber app. So left it was. As we walked, a police car's blaring siren tore past us, headed south, and I made a lame joke about it not being very romantic.</p>
<p>The restaurants were indeed more sparse to the north, so when we found <a class="reference external" href="http://www.les-enfants-perdus.com/">Les Enfants Perdus</a> we quickly went in.</p>
<p><img alt="image1" src="/static/2015/11/les_enfants_perdus.jpg" /></p>
<p>Five minutes, we were told. No problem: the bartender looked like he knew what he was doing. I ordered a Sazerac. Not-particularly-soon-after we were seated uncomfortably close to an older couple, just past the bulk of the bar.</p>
<p>When did it stop being a regular meal? I'm not entirely sure. The wait staff locked the doors at some point, but I thought perhaps dinner service was ending. Waves of additional emergency vehicles sped south, but this was a city, after all. Snippets of English kept reaching us from across the room, containing increasingly alarming words. With growing frequency, the sound system erupted in booming, buzzy hums as the staff swapped out iPhones to take calls and send urgent texts. Bit by bit, we all stopped looking at our companions and food and began staring into our smartphones.</p>
<p><p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/22697860877/in/dateposted-public/"><img alt="Les Enfants Perdu" src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/699/22697860877_b409aac505_z.jpg" style="width: 361px; height: 640px;" /></a></p>
<script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p><p>I'd drunk enough to want to make <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/tjl/status/665290872175484928">off-color jokes on Twitter</a>, so I set about doing that. Steph and I didn't think there was much to be done but to wait out the emergency, so we ordered more drinks and more dishes, which were slower and slower to arrive.</p>
<p>The rumors in the room and online intensified. We soon heard about the siege at the Bataclan, though not yet the full extent of that horror. But people were saying this was not all, that drive-by shootings were still occurring, that a new attack was unfolding at Les Halles, far from our restaurant but quite close to our apartment. No one denied that gunmen were still at large.</p>
<p>It did not seem safe to go outside. Soon, the staff acknowledged what was occurring: a blonde waiter without much English did some comic capering to lighten the mood, and his colleagues assured us that the restaurant's large glass windows were bulletproof, which seemed unlikely. The neighborhood was now cordoned from traffic, they said; there would be no taxis. The owner announced that everyone was welcome to stay, but the staff would call the hotel a block away on our behalf if we'd like.</p>
<p>We stayed. Many diners left for nearby cars or short, furtive walks home. Eventually only four or five parties remained. The staff asked us to assemble at one table and assured us again that there was no need to leave. They opened some bottles of champagne, they put on the Beatles' White Album. The doors were declared to be definitively locked, and cigarettes appeared as if by sleight of hand. The blonde waiter sat down with us, said he had given away his tickets to that evening's show at the Bataclan, and began weeping. I watched as Steph comforted him. I continued to check my phone.</p>
<p>By two AM, I was thinking seriously about sleep and how glad I was that the restaurant's back room decor featured padded benches and implausibly fluffy pillows. But our fellow diners were restless. Group by group, they decided to walk. We checked the hashtag that the media had been writing about, the one by which Parisians were offering refuge to those stranded on the street. Useless. Steph called some of the nearby hotels, but they couldn't help.</p>
<p>So: bikeshare. There is a Velibe station in front of Les Enfants Perdus, but not one that takes credit cards. Our maître d' led us through a block and a half of empty streets, and then several pages of inscrutable French bikeshare menus. We looked with fear into every car that passed.</p>
<p>I hope I will never see Paris that empty again. Police cars prowled the streets, activating their sirens every other block. And there were people, more than I expected, but all walking in the same direction or huddled in doorways, speaking urgently into their phones.</p>
<p>The Velibe top gear is much better-considered than D.C. bikeshare's, and we plunged through the streets. Outside a nightclub people were massing, piling into cars. I remember desperately wanting to get away from them, from any group of people, any crowd. But otherwise the ride felt quiet, urgent, unpanicked.</p>
<p>A wrong turn dropped us too far west, in front of a police station across from Notre Dame. Men in police jackets were milling around on the corner, looking unsure of what to do, as if the real cops, headed to Saint-Martin, had told their little brothers to put on ill-fitting departmental jackets and do their best. We biked past the cathedral, finding more police guarding the monument--some sitting near-invisibly in nondescript cars. Ever since landing our Americanness had been reliably detected from hundreds of meters away, and this was no exception. The cops saw us, but melted from our path.</p>
<p>We dropped our bikes at a station next to the Seine and crossed to Île Saint-Louis, immediately feeling safer for no good reason. Soon we were in our apartment.</p>
<p>I kept thinking about what I'd read: that people in the Bataclan had sent messages begging the police to come, that they were being executed one by one. That was the thought that horrified me more than any other. But soon sleep came. I woke up feeling no wiser than the morning before.</p>

<p>Yglesias has just published a great post about robots' persistent failure to put us all out of work. <a class="reference external" href="http://www.vox.com/2015/7/27/9038829/automation-myth">You should go read it immediately</a>, forsaking any activities that contribute to GDP.</p>
<p>This is part of Matt's thesis, of course: that information technology is contributing to welfare in ways that don't show up in productivity numbers. This makes some sense. Right now the digital music player on my kitchen counter is humming some vaguely new-wavey Millennial band, and by doing so offering me both greater control and higher fidelity than its radio forebears. Those differences are not necessarily captured in its price tag.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I spent part of Sunday reading a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.wired.com/2015/07/secret-cold-war-maps/">great Wired story about sneaking paper maps out of post-Soviet Russia</a>, smuggling briefcases full of cash into Parisian cafes while trailed by KGB agents. It sounds like it was considerably more trouble than I had this morning, when I researched, located and priced out Slovenian geospatial data from their government's (non-English) website. It took me about one and a half cups of coffee to get through it, which were much more pleasant than flying across an ocean and maybe getting injected with polonium (the Parisian cafe bit sounds okay).</p>
<p>Still, I think Yglesias is probably right: there's value showing up off the books, there's goofing off, there's overstatement of the importance of the IT-relevant section of the economy, and there's genuine value being created. And it looks like it's been a mistake to just assume that the last effect will surely swamp the others.</p>
<p>This makes IT innovations a different beast from affirmed productivity boosters like HVAC and dishwashers. Those things manipulate actual atoms, and seem to produce wealth and surplus time in a way that software might not.</p>
<p>Here's the thing, though: from a certain perspective, those are pretty much all the same machine. You can create an astounding number of things with a motor and some switches and some surrounding plastic and metal bricabrac, including not only the aforementioned appliances but your dryer, refrigerator, automobile, running water, vacuum cleaner, garbage disposal and washer/dryer. Lately these appliances been tarted up with LEDs and microcontrollers, but they all come down to a fairly simple switch mechanism detecting input and, when appropriate, setting a motor turning. Powered rotary motion has been a great friend to humanity (not least thanks to the satisfaction to be had from an afternoon spent browsing <a class="reference external" href="http://507movements.com/">websites about mechanical linkages</a>).</p>
<p>But even the noble rotary motor has its limits, tasks that humans can do but which we cannot plausibly harness the awe-inspiring might of rotation and switches to accomplish. Preparing good meals, cleaning bathrooms, navigating road traffic--all of these require a bit more finesse. Or at least a much more complicated collection of switches and motors. Perhaps we won't be able to deliver that finesse, but it sure <em>looks</em> like we're close. The Roomba knockoff in my living room isn't perfect, but it really has dramatically reduced the percentage of time I spend on certain classes of housework.</p>
<p>I won't dwell on autonomous vehicles. But c'mon. Even the most curmudgeonly unmanned vehicle skeptic can buy a startlingly cheap drone. Even he must admit that we could deploy slow, unmenacing delivery droids to toddle along our sidewalks today, if we weren't so convinced that actual cars, with all the inalienable rights American society affords them, were just around the corner. A truly enormous economic class of atom-moving will be converted from labor to capital in short order. It will involve information technology, yes. But this will be no Facebook.</p>
<p>And from there, who knows? I'm not sure that <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTlV0Y5yAww">Asimo</a> will be scrubbing my toilet anytime soon; perhaps one of his descendants will lift my withered body back into its goo-filled pod after every fresh organ installation. Moving atoms around is very hard if you're facing a problem you can't cheat your way out of with photolithography, and I doubt that a Google Car will be the harbinger of robotic burger chefs.</p>
<p>Still. The car thing. That will be a big one. We're going to notice it.</p>

                    <p><a class="reference external" href="http://gawker.com/what-if-teens-arent-cool-1699997713">Sam Biddle thinks we care too much about teens</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
Teens will betray you. Teens won’t even remember your URL. They’ll click whatever’s put in front of them. They’re colliding particles. Would you interview a bee? Should tech investors study a pile of wobbling sea foam? Adult culture has become so obsessed with harvesting youth culture that we haven’t stopped to consider whether or not these kids are basically just gangly, brand-obsessed dorks who drive poorly and have partially formed brains. We’ve been worshipping at the consumer altar of teenagers that we’ve forgotten how little this particular crop has done for us; their cultural pinnacles are EDM and acoustic Vine covers. And why be surprised? Can we resent teens for not being little culture panaceas when their entire world consists of apps, track practice, and their house? We’re the fools for thinking the tiny teen world view really became larger just because it now includes the internet.</blockquote>
<p>But Sam's wrong: the app-industrial complex's slavering maw yearns for teens not because they contain a cure for internet ennui, but because it knows they are its next host.</p>
<p>You know how you hate using Facebook? How it's nothing but a social obligation and professional imposition? That is the feeling of terminal stage brand loyalty. Someone is now making money off you, because your shared business relationship has aged past the point where they have any reason to please you.</p>
<p>If this were a Buffy episode about drugs, now would be the time when you'd be comatose in the back of a hovel, your life force slowly draining away into some monster that delivered mystic euphoria during act one. Except nobody is about to come crashing through the door to liberate you via a poorly choreographed fight sequence.</p>
<p>Today's teens are tomorrow's locked-in social network users, and if they seem frustratingly flighty now it only means it will be that much sweeter when they finally fall into the snare.</p>

                    <p>I love my friend Brian Beutler. But I didn't like <a class="reference external" href="http://www.newrepublic.com/article/121406/civil-war-150th-anniversary-confederacy-defeat-should-be-holiday">his piece calling for a holiday celebrating the confederacy's defeat</a> or <a class="reference external" href="http://www.newrepublic.com/article/121477/civil-war-150th-anniversary-southerners-should-celebrate-union">its followup</a>.</p>
<p>Brian is an excellent writer and he makes his argument well. But this kind of Acela Corridor confrontationalism is inherently cartoonish, and it relies on a cartoonish understanding of one's countrymen. Like this, where the cultural identity of a large chunk of the country is reduced to nothing more than a devotion to white supremacy:</p>
<blockquote>
[W]e probably wouldn’t call the region “The South” if its political identity weren’t still interwoven with a glossy conception of the Confederacy.</blockquote>
<p>This is even harsher than usual: ordinarily Southerners are at least granted a nod toward fried food and congregationalist religion before being called racists.</p>
<p>Jokes aside, I can't help reacting to the existence of these pieces personally. I was born in Virginia. My last name is Lee. The line of my ancestry goes through Robert E. Lee's father and up to a <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Henry_Lee">bunch of other dead guys</a>, all of whom, I'm quite sure, held odious views and did odious things. To a first approximation absolutely everyone in history was an asshole, but it is certainly true that some managed to do more harm than others. My blood contains echoes of a few who were in a position to hurt lots of people, and did.</p>
<p>Brian wants a fresh verdict about the moral obscenity of the Confederacy, commemorated with a holiday and the destruction of monuments venerating Confederate figures. I don't think anyone should object to the underlying judgment; I agree that the idea of flying a Confederate flag is disgusting. But it's sometimes hard not to feel that my fellow liberals' modern desire to relitigate an old war -- to emphatically celebrate a victory no one living remembers -- is driven more by moral vanity than a considered approach to ending racism in contemporary society.</p>
<p>If those highways were quietly renamed and statues wordlessly removed, I wouldn't care. A few others might, but I wouldn't care about that, either. But I do resent the idea that this is *my* problem by virtue of where I was born or who my ancestors were -- that it is my responsibility to account for it. People seem to think it is. Brian's pieces are addressed to everyone in the South, not to Neoconfederates specifically. There's a reason that he IMed me the link to his article after he hit publish. There's a reason my high school girlfriend told me not to mention my last name when I met her mom. There's a reason people sometimes make jokes about owning slaves when they meet me (really). They are demanding that I repudiate a tribe they've imagined for me, and that I glorify one that they have implicitly excluded me from. I wonder what their manners are like when they meet someone from Germany or Japan.</p>
<p>Fuck all that. My grandmother came down from Vermont and married a Lee, who grew up a missionary's son in China and spent his declining years writing impassioned letters about foreign policy to the editors of the Washington Post. I remember finding my dad's old slot car set in their attic, the slower, always-losing racecar labeled &quot;BIGOT&quot; -- a household moral axiom clumsily translated into child's handwriting. I won't tolerate being told those people bore some kind of hereditary moral contamination, or smile at the idea of assigning original sin on the basis of birthplace. The merits of the long-dead have nothing to say about my grandparents' failings or virtues. Nor our own.</p>
<p>So yes, no more veneration of the Confederates. But also no more unprompted denigration. No more thirst for confrontation. Just silence. Stop talking about them. Allow their names to fade into meaningless strings of syllables that signify nothing more than where one span of asphalt ends and another begins. Or better: nothing at all.</p>
<p>I'd be a fool to claim that historical grievances have no bearing on today's injustices. But insisting on self-abasement by the children of wrongdoers has less power to heal than the descendants of the righteous flatter themselves to think. There is more pressing work we could all be doing.</p>

                    <p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/16115795969/"><img alt="the sacred dignity of fashion trends" class="alignright" src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8665/16115795969_37099953e4_n_d.jpg" style="width: 320px; height: 320px;" /></a>I had been called to jury duty several times before, but never selected. Steph is an attorney, Charles was an investigator, people in my family have gone to jail, and I've seen enough movies to know that the police can be compromised (<em>Blade</em>, for instance).</p>
<p>So I was confident I could weasel out of my latest summons, and all the more so when I learned the case was a DUI. I stood before the judge and stoically recounted the times I had found myself on the hoods of thoughtless motorists. Why, your honor, I half-chuckled, I would have been standing here in November if a driver hadn't broken my collarbone and driven off.</p>
<p>But do you think that experience would interfere with your ability to judge this case impartially?</p>
<p>No, I replied. I held my gaze steady and locked on the judge, confident that, in the periphery of my vision, the attorneys would see the zeal for bicyclist jihad that was blazing in my eyes. I would surely be struck from the jury pool, freed by my victimhood.</p>
<p>Well, no such luck. I was selected for the jury and spent the next day listening to a very brief trial. The facts were these.</p>
<p>Around 3 AM on a Thursday morning, the defendent emerged from a cab on a side street in Adams Morgan. She walked past three bike cops--unsteadily, though perhaps not staggering--and got into her car. Moments after she had started the engine, an officer was tapping on the glass, asking her to get out. She had some trouble producing her license, and left the car in gear when she first tried to emerge. It lurched and she had to hurriedly swing her body back inside to brake. She never left her parking spot.</p>
<p>She admitted to having a drink, but said she thought she was okay to drive. She then failed the first of three field sobriety tests--the horizontal gaze nystagmus test, the one where the officer makes you follow a point with your eyes--displaying six out of six potential indicators of intoxication. She then began to fail the next test (walking a straight line), but refused to complete it, saying it was too late in the evening. She refused the third test as well (standing on one foot), and so was cuffed and taken to the Third Distict station. There she refused to use the breathalyzer, acknowledging on a form that this meant she would lose her driver's license for twelve months.</p>
<p>So. That was the prosecution's case. The defense took its turn, but was unimpressive. There was some inconsistency in how the testifying officers described their physical locations on the street relative to the defendent. The newest cop was caught claiming that he could smell alcohol on the defendant from fifteen feet away.</p>
<p>Here, the defense convinced me: the uniformity of the police claims of alcoholic odor and bloodshot eyes were suspicious. I'm not trained to watch for such things, but I don't think I've noticed someone smelling of booze more than a handful of times; other signs of drunkenness seem much easier to detect. In rooms where videos like <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sDW80isb6E">this one</a> are shown, I have no doubt that officers are told they should always claim these unverifiable impressions.</p>
<p>The extent to which the police had been trained for the courtroom was subtle but impressive. The defense asked if the testifying officer was familiar with a textbook about field sobriety tests; in fact he not only knew it, but could name distinctions between its editions, identified to the month. The tech from the station was eager to explain the difference between the semi-discredited Intoxilyzer and the new and faultless Intoximeter.</p>
<p>More than this, their affect and conduct made an impression. The steady eye contact with the jury; the friendly confidence; the polite references to the defendant; the lack of mistaken use of gestures or imprecise speech, knowing that they were participating in the creation of a written transcript. I couldn't help wonder whether the second officer--an MPD veteran of several years--was putting us on when he appeared uncertain about how to approach the witness stand or navigate the courtroom's other logistical minutiae. Surely he had done this exact thing dozens of times in this very building, probably in this very room.</p>
<p>The defense amounted to little more than nitpicking. No witnesses, brief cross-examinations. We went to the jury room without much doubt about the evening's events, but unsure whether they were enough to produce a conviction.</p>
<p>Per the judge's instructions, two standards had to be met. Was the defendant operating the vehicle in DC? The law says that you merely have to be &quot;in control&quot; of a vehicle. It doesn't even have to be running! Pushing a car out of the snow or leaving your hands on the steering wheel can qualify. We all agreed that this criterion had been met.</p>
<p>The other standard related to the defendant being &quot;under the influence of alcohol&quot;. This means impairment of her ability to operate a vehicle to an extent that could be perceived. There is no specific threshold or test that divides impairment from non-impairment.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the judge's instructions stated that the defendant's refusal to take the breathalyzer could enter into our consideration. Specifically: this refusal could be interpreted as evidence of &quot;feelings of guilt&quot;, which could in turn be taken as evidence of actual guilt. Steph feels this is unconstitutional, and I admit that it felt a bit fishy to me, too. But it was plain as day in the instructions.</p>
<p>The jury quickly settled into a 10-2 split favoring a conviction. One dissenter remained quiet, but the other was happy to argue on the defendant's behalf. I sat next to this gentleman during the trial, and found him to be friendly and pleasant. But he was a bad juror. He seemed used to being afforded respect and being celebrated for his cleverness. At home I suspect he is considered a man of erudition. Alas, his arguments betrayed an imprecision of thought and an eagerness to use the proceedings for a sort of role-playing.</p>
<p>Among the arguments he brought to the table:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>&quot;Only one of three tests was administered; that's 33%. And we know that test is only 77% accurate. That's only a 25% chance she was impaired!&quot; [In fact, that 77% figure was quoted for observations of 4 of 6 indicators at 0.1% BAC; the defendant displayed 6 of 6. Also this is not how statistics works.]</li>
<li>&quot;We have her signature on the form where she declined the breathalyzer. Let's ask for a current signature and compare [to look for differences due to drunkenness].&quot; To my embarrassment, a note was passed to the judge asking for this new evidence, which he politely rejected.</li>
<li>A suggestion--seconded by several other jurors--that we consider the defendant's appearance and decide whether she looked like an alcoholic. This was particularly revolting to me, and I said as much.</li>
</ul>
<p>Basically, justice is terrible. Many of the other jurors weren't much better, confusing facts and engaging in inappropriate flights of speculation before being shut down by their peers.</p>
<p>I don't know that I was so much better. I could assemble relatively cleaner arguments, but I left the courtroom feeling equivocal about the presumption of innocence and reasonable doubt; and I was saddened by the likelihood that the police had watched a drunk woman walk to her car, patiently waiting to stop her until she had--just barely--committed a serious crime. I walked into the jury room thinking &quot;guilty&quot;, but the sense of the majority cemented this from opinion into belief. At some point I stopped bothering to dismantle bad arguments coming from those on my side.</p>
<p>And the rhetorical skills lacking in some other jurors lacked amounted to little more than a clumsiness at manipulation. At one point we received an answer to a question we had asked the judge, and the answer undercut the argument for exoneration. My fellow jurors immediately pounced on the hold-out, browbeating him with this new fact rather than giving him space to admit a change of heart while retaining some dignity. I found myself waving them off, even though I agreed with their position. I wanted to get out of there. I was ready to bend the conversation to that need.</p>
<p>The holdout's ego survived this attack, and he reluctantly agreed to a guilty verdict. Besides, he noted, he had a lunch appointment to get to. A verdict was read to an impassive defendant, whose life became much (but I hope not disastrously) worse. We were thanked for our service, collected our $4 per diems, and walked out into the cold, mostly confident that we had done something.</p>

<p>Earlier today I <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/tjl/status/555026586274377728">complained</a> about one class of hopeless apps that often applied for grants from Sunlight. It eventually became clear to me that web annotation tools were another. That's not to say that they weren't cool--heck, we even <a class="reference external" href="http://poligraft.com">built some ourselves</a>. But it's definitely a low-percentage play.</p>
<p>Consequently I think that Genius's efforts to expand into a news app are probably hopeless (there's no money in news apps to begin with, and probably even less in this one). But that doesn't mean the site hasn't done something clever.</p>
<p>In particular, they've paired excellent technical execution with even better timing. It seems clear that lyrics sites can make at least <em>some</em> money--the web is littered with heaps of garbage like azlyrics.com. They're benign parasites, the geothermal vent-hugging tubeworms of the internet, thriving in an ecological niche made possible by larger, more popular cultural phenomena. The Genius guys picked just the right genre (hip hop, with its closely associated and copyright-averse mixtape and sampling cultures) and just the right moment (when noncorporate reproduction of others' IP became a part of everyone's daily communication habits). This let them become a more polished operation than the fly-by-night SEO lyric farms that had lived and died by the whims of record company lawyers and Russian webhosts. And that, in turn, has let them take investors along for what looks like a pretty fun ride.</p>
<p>The calculated executive outrageousness and appearances on various future-of-news plenaries are meant to distract you from a business model that has always been founded on accidental Google traffic and encouraging visitors to click on popup ads.</p>
<p>Perhaps there's a plausible escape route. But what seems more likely is the story we've seen again and again on the internet: somebody builds a business next to an existing one, the incumbent waits until revenues appear and then throws a fit, and the courts decide if it's Napster time or Spotify o'clock. Usually it's a more interesting underlying industry and a less compelling product. But we've been here before.</p>

<p>The idea can be opened up a little more, though. I think &quot;auto-intoxication&quot; is a mental tic that goes way beyond our physical well-being. That we are polluted with something that diminishes us is a pervasive kind of neuroticism, one arguably present in everything from dietary concerns to Scientology's body thetans to the doctrine of original sin. I've come to believe it's an evolutionary feature of humans, one related at the very least to our tendency toward spirituality and perhaps even to the kind of mammalian restlessness that we call &quot;work ethic.&quot;</p>
<p>When applied to food and health this <a class="reference external" href="/2011/02/16/a-skeptic-is-an-activist-whos-been-mugged-by-the-huffpo-wellness-section/">drives me nuts</a>, in no small part because I have had to grapple with my own relatives' inventions in this genre. For years dad wouldn't go to a conventional doctor for his disorientation and memory problems thanks to my aunt's diagnosis of mercury poisoning, which proved robust despite various disconfirming test results. It doesn't take much to sustain these suspicions. In his case, merely anecdotal observation of how symptoms (sometimes!) responded to nutritional supplements and, perhaps, the ecclesiastical satisfaction to be had through near-hourly observance of my aunt's prescribed chelation regimen.</p>
<p>In the last few days I've seen these mystical habits of mind on a less worrying scale, as a guy I like and respect translated his negative opinion of Wal-mart--developed, presumably, because of their effects on workers and the economy--to guess that the chain's produce might be particularly riddled with glyphosate, the purported negative health effects of which he had recently been reading about.</p>
<p>Some of this is probably due to the media's translation of statistical accounts of epidemiological phenomena into stories that are causally simple enough to be understood by everyone. Something does something or it doesn't; confidence intervals and statistical significance are the first thing to go when we compose a mental synopsis.</p>
<p>But I think much of it is in-built: an inherited need to seek personal purity (even if only in relative terms). I suppose there are worse ways for this to manifest than time spent in Whole Foods.</p>

                    <p>I was saying something dumb on Twitter and stumbled across <a class="reference external" href="/2008/12/31/ads-intents-and-obsolescence/">an old post about the constricting array of tools available to advertisers as consumers become ever more attuned to manipulation</a>. I'm now less sure that this idea isn't just a product of my own limited imagination. Still, an observation in its favor:</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="/static/2014/12/IMG_6426.png"><img alt="banana republic instagram ad featuring a puppy from the humane society" class="aligncenter wp-image-2907 size-large" src="/static/2014/12/IMG_6426-576x1024.png" style="width: 576px; height: 1024px;" /></a></p>
<p>This is the first Instagram advertisement I've seen that attracted anything less than intense vitriol in its comments (&quot;why the fuck is this in my feed&quot;, etc). And you can see why: it's barely an advertisement at all. It's just a photo of an adorable puppy (people like puppies) and an invocation of the idea of saving puppies (people like pretending that media consumption can be a form of altruism).</p>
<p>In one sense: congratulations, Banana Republic #brand managers! You've cracked the code. This is going to make for a great SXSW panel.</p>
<p>In another: what's the point? I won't pretend this ad hasn't manipulated me to some degree. I no longer have enough faith in human cognition to muster that level of self-flattering defiance. But even if some part of me now feels better about Banana Republic--if we grant that some hypothetical fMRI study could&nbsp;now show a slightly stronger correlation in metabolic activity between my Sweater Cortex and my Puppy Striatum--how easily can this be converted into cash money? There is, after all, a gulf between getting someone to agree that a thing is nice and getting them to give you money for it. I doubt that Instagram clients are keen to reinvent&nbsp;the nonprofit fundraising industry.</p>
<p>Perhaps this boils down to the same old unanswerable questions about <em>mindshare</em> and <em>brand awareness</em>--ideas that, to an untrained observer such as myself, sure sound like the kind of bullshit you invent when you can't show your boss any concrete results.</p>
<p>And yet every year the same Coca-Cola ads featuring Santa and, more recently (and pan-religio/culturally) polar bears--issued, presumably, from the vast bunker beneath the Masonic Temple in Alexandria. They must think they know something we don't about making us know things we don't think we know. Right?</p>

                    <p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ssoosay/5982796280/in/photostream/"><img alt="stylized photo of malcolm gladwell" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2899" src="/static/2014/12/5982796280_f68a4753a9_z.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 433px;" /></a></p>
<p>There are defensible reasons for disliking Malcolm Gladwell (too glib!) and bad reasons for disliking him (too successful!). <a class="reference external" href="https://ksj.mit.edu/tracker/2014/12/malcolm-gladwell-faces-new-charges-of-using-others-information-without-attribution/">But this is the reason that irritates me the most</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
Gladwell has used information from others without attribution, often in language that closely resembles the source. [...] There is one possible escape clause for Gladwell here--something that could absolve him of any guilt or plagiarism charge. Many journalists--especially magazine writers--have for decades subscribed to the idea that the use of established facts does not require attribution. [...] I've long been troubled by the use of unattributed material with the excuse that it's already been disseminated and established. When does the need for attribution fall away? Where do we draw the line?</blockquote>
<p>The example cited is about the specifics of an old public works project--a particular&nbsp;tunnel's length and cost, its difficulty and progress. It's taken from a hard-to-find book of economic history by John E. Sawyer, which was published in 1952. Gladwell could have and probably should have provided attribution to Sawyer--it's hard to see what the downside would have been.</p>
<p>But it's also hard to see the downside to what happened. <a class="reference external" href="http://www.americanantiquarian.org/proceedings/44574406.pdf">Jack Sawyer has been dead for twenty years</a>. Gladwell's offense, if there is one, has been committed against our collective sensibilities, not against a person.</p>
<p>There are good reasons to consider plagiarism bad. Enforcing rules of fair play within the writing professions makes sense as an economic necessity. But proof of copying is not proof of deprivation. Adding a moral dimension to the prosecution of victimless crimes requires an unpleasant meanness of spirit.</p>
<p>I feel a bit sad whenever someone is drummed out of office for, say, a lifted graduation speech or some other misappropriation that isn't the crux of their job. I'm sure that I, too, would be disappointed to learn that the greatness of words I admired was borrowed, and I would want to punish the speaker, to reclaim my misapplied esteem. But why? We can make all the words and esteem we want.</p>
<p>The idea that facts belong to someone is crazy. It's a fiction we use to ensure that fact-creators keep creating facts. The usefulness of this game of make-believe is obvious enough to have been <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_Clause">pithily expressed</a> hundreds of years ago. Maybe it's because it's such an old story that so many people have started to believe it's real.</p>
<p>Perhaps I've been radicalized by work--the nonsensical nature of database licensing agreements could drive anyone mad. Ignore, for a moment <a class="reference external" href="http://www.copyright.gov/reports/dbase.html">the impossibility of conjuring a coherent line between &quot;a bunch of facts&quot; and &quot;a legally protected database&quot;</a>. There are other problems!</p>
<p>These licensing agreements invariably prohibit some uses of the knowledge contained in the database, and these prohibitions rarely make much sense. When read with eyes too inexperienced to know what not to see, the text often outlaws the very thing the database is meant to facilitate. When you ask the salesperson about this, they assure you that what the agreement says is not what it means. And they're right. What it means is: <strong>make sure we can keep getting paid</strong>. You can let people have this information but not, you know, let them <em>have</em> it. Make sure you tell it to them in a way that ensures they will pretend not to know what they know.</p>
<p>I don't begrudge this approach. What else can they do? These databases are expensive to create and maintain, and we should all be glad that someone is doing this work. It's a fiction that we navigate and treat with respect. But it is pretty absurd.</p>
<p>When the process is complete--when the tunnel is done, its specifics related, its chronicler dead--we can drop the pretense. And we should. It's disappointing to see those who esteem ideas arguing that they ought to be more scarce.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>It was the best school that I could afford, and I think it gave me a good education. But it was never a great fit for me. I met some people there that I really liked and many more that I didn't. I identified with <a class="reference external" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1504300/">these kids</a>, not the ones in ties at football games. I seemed to be the only person thrilled that Stephen Malkmus had gone to UVA (including Mr. Malkmus).</p>
<p>When I read the Rolling Stone article, I believed it. I had known and disliked the callous frat culture. I had been disgusted by <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cavalierdaily.com/article/2001/11/jury-awards-former-uva-student-damages/">the university judicial system's failure to grapple with the beating of Sandy Kory</a>, and was unsurprised to hear that it had failed Jackie, too. And I believe that sexual assault is an enormous problem on American college campuses. I didn't bother to finish reading the story, to be honest. It only took a few hundred words to bring me to despair, and I knew what the rest would say.</p>
<p>When critics raised doubts about the story, I believed them, too. I knew and was friends with people in frats -- the stoner and geek frats, but frats nonetheless. I even rushed one, briefly! At a school like UVA these connections to the Greek system are all but unavoidable, particularly if you are underage and keen on drinking. Although their culture was sexist and aesthetically distasteful, it never seemed violent to me. Individuals behaving despicably was and is all too believable. But a premeditated, group-level endorsement of predatory violence seemed unlikely, particularly given the frats' years of experience projecting the most upstanding image they could manage to help keep the party going.</p>
<p>And of course there were other problems, some of which will only make sense to alumni. <a class="reference external" href="http://gawker.com/that-uva-frat-letter-denying-rape-is-bullshit-and-heres-1667421511">Gawker's dismissal of the timing of fraternity rush as a salient factor seems unwarranted</a>, for instance.</p>
<p>I was unsure what to think. Because of conflicting evidence and heuristics? Only superficially. In truth, it's because I have competing self-conceptions that can justify themselves in different ways depending on what we collectively decide this episode's moral will be. I am a supercilious iconoclast who disdained the frats, even as he let them buy him oceans of beer. And I am a UVA graduate who thinks but does not say the phrase &quot;public ivy&quot; and who doesn't want people to think of rape when he tells them where he went to school.</p>
<p>My thoughts are ambivalent but they are uniformly tainted by emotion and vanity. And although their reasons are different, I think this true for most people discussing this case, and everything else, on the internet.</p>
<p>How could it be otherwise? We don't have enough information to judge the truth. There are endless explanations and additions that could modulate every atom of the narrative, but no amount of reporting is likely to let us access them satisfactorily. Luckily, we don't care that much. Instead we will settle for asserting, by fiat, how the world must have worked in this instance, reasoning from first principles: we are good, and the people we dislike are bad, and reality, in the long run, must surely reflect this distinction.</p>
<p>I no longer believe that I have a right to hold an opinion about what it was or when it happened, but I am pretty sure that something very bad happened to Jackie and that she's suffering because of it, and because of this she deserves sympathy and help. I believe it's her right to go to advocates for support or to the police for justice, but I don't believe that the rest of us deserve to continue gawking at her horror -- particularly now that the conversation surrounding it has lost any plausible claim to preventing future violence.</p>

<p>Inertial navigation -- tracking position by keeping a careful tally of acceleration&nbsp;(originally, by using gyrocopes) -- is particularly badass.</p>

<p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/roomscan-app-that-draws-floor/id571436618?mt=8">RoomScan</a> app uses these techniques to let you build accurate models of interiors by sliding your iPhone along the wall. Using it during the home-buying process was an I'm-living-in-the-future moment. (<a class="reference external" href="http://mac.softpedia.com/get/iPhone-Applications/Tools-Utilities/iSaber.shtml">Making light saber noises</a> is also good.)</p>
<p>The two things that jumped out at me from the book were about the GPS system and the silliness of politics. First, on the popular myth that Ronald Reagan's bold vision is the reason the military-built GPS system was opened to civilian use:</p>
<p><img alt="reagan_gps" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2871" src="/static/2014/12/reagan_gps.png" style="width: 500px; height: 194px;" /></p>
<p>And second, on the idea that Bill Clinton's brave decision to unlock the GPS system's full precision to civilian uses is what delivered our current era of accurately-positioned benefits:</p>
<p><img alt="coast_guard_gps" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2875" src="/static/2014/12/coast_guard_gps2.png" style="width: 500px;" /></p>
<p>It turns out various other agencies were successfully building systems to defeat selective availability, too, notably including the FAA. But good for you, Coast Guard. This might have been the highest-altitude DRM system of all time, but it didn't work any better than the rest.</p>
<p>Our positioning is going to get even better, incidentally. iPhone chips can already use not only GPS signals but those of GLONASS, Russia's competing (and never-crippled) system. The EU is launching Galileo, <a class="reference external" href="http://gpsworld.com/test-shows-galileo-increases-accuracy-of-location-based-services/">which promises to improve accuracy even further</a>. In fact, its (paywalled) commercial version will allegedly deliver precisions of just a few centimeters.</p>

<p>Some people have told me that Flickr's plans bother them because it changes their understanding of their relationship with the company. Companies are not people, and I will gently suggest that it is unwise to cultivate emotional relationships with them. Doing so invites disappointment or manipulation.</p>
<p>So let's look at the other reasons that people are upset about this. I think that many people&nbsp;are either behaving irrationally or do not understand what free culture licensing means.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Flickr users are under no obligation to add a Creative Commons By-Attribution (CC-BY) license to their work. It is and has always been easy for users to retain complete control over distribution of their photos if they care to do so.</li>
<li>Just as easily, Flickr users can select a CC-BY-NC license, which allows reuse of their work for noncommercial purposes.</li>
<li>Right now, CC-BY images on Flickr are often used for various commercial purposes. There is nothing stopping anyone, anywhere, from selling a print of your CC-BY licensed work, nor from downloading your CC-BY licensed photo and making a print for themselves.</li>
<li>Flickr's sale of prints does not deprive photographers of their work or money. Users have the same ability to use their work that they always had. The vast majority would never have taken the steps necessary to profit from their work, so print sales do not deprive them of money. When a user really expects to sell prints, they should avoid Creative Commons licensing, which, as I've mentioned, is easily done.</li>
<li>Flickr's sale of prints provides benefits to other people. People who work for and own Flickr make money. The vendors producing&nbsp;and delivering the prints make money. And people who buy prints get to enjoy works of art.</li>
<li>Some people have earnestly-held beliefs about this last point amounting to a bad thing. But not very many (it's a difficult trick to pull off without also rejecting most aspects of global civilization). Most people think these are good things.</li>
<li>I suspect that many Flickr users agree that the things in point 5 are good. It's just that they'd like to have control over when they happen. Maybe it's okay for the local coffeeshop to use your photos on a flyer, but it's not okay for Archer-Daniels-Midland to put them on a billboard. I suspect this is how a lot of people feel, because I used to feel this way, too. But if you insist on control, those good things in point 5 usually <em>won't</em> happen, because it's too hard to ask for permission every time you want to use a piece of culture. This is one of the main reasons why Creative Commons licensing was invented.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Open licensing is about giving up control so that other people can benefit.</strong> That's all it will cost you: control. Having control feels nice. But you should ask yourself what it really gets you. And you should think about what others might gain if you were able to let go.</p>
<p>Think carefully and decide what you need. No one is going to make you tick that Creative Commons box. But when you do, it's a promise.</p>

<p>I worry that I'm beginning to stagnate: my palette of duct tape, under armour and LEDs is flexible enough for a variety of comic book characters. If augmented with adhesive velcro strips and the choice of a pouch-laden Rob Liefeld character, it's even sort of convenient.</p>
<p>The LED components are always a hit, and I've seen more costumes incorporating them in recent years. I've added light to my costumes with a variety of different systems in the past, but they always had shortcomings. This is the first year that I achieved a well-engineered yet simple implementation, so it seems worth writing up how best to do it.</p>
<div class="section" id="led-strips">
<h2>LED strips</h2>
<p>China now produces these in great volumes, and they're both cheap and easy to work with. Tons of different colors and configurations are available from <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/1-20M-RGB-5050-SMD-waterproof-300-LED-Light-Strip-Flexible-IR-Remote-12V-power-/161255347539?pt=US_String_Lights_Fairy_Lights&amp;var=&amp;hash=item258b915553">eBay</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=led+strip">Amazon</a>, invariably arriving on black plastic spools and with peel-off adhesive backing. Besides color, you'll have to decide on brightness, which varies both LEDs per meter and LED type, and waterproofing. For a halloween costume, pretty much anything will be fine -- which is to say blindingly bright.</p>
<p>The strips can only be cut in certain spots, but these are clearly marked. Solder tabs are present if you want to connect strips together. You're going to need a soldering iron to connect the strip to power, but it's about the simplest soldering job imaginable.</p>

<div class="section" id="power">
<h2>Power</h2>
<p>The strips aren't just LEDs: they also have integrated resistors that are rated for 12 volts, presumably because this is the voltage at which automotive systems run. That's what you'll need to supply to the strip. You have a few options:</p>
<ul class="simple">

Alkaline batteries like AA cells, AAA cells and D cells are all 1.5 volts per cell, meaning that 8 placed in series will give your LEDs the power they need. You can find appropriate battery cases at Radioshack or eBay (you might need to chain two four-battery cases together). This is arguably the easiest of the approaches listed here, but also the shortest-lived and the one most likely to cause problems if asked to power too many LEDs (particularly with AAA cells, which I don't recommend).</li>
<li>Lead-acid batteries are rechargeable, can hold a ton of power, and come in 12 volt or 6 volt varieties. Avoid the latter, buy a cheap trickle charger, and connect directly to your LEDs. The downside, as the name suggests, is weight (and price -- a small battery will probably run $30). Any lead-acid battery is likely to be 10 or 15 pounds. For the right costume, this is no problem. For others, it's a huge pain in the ass. If it suits your needs, though, a lead-acid battery can be a handy thing to have around: keep one charged and one of these doohickeys on hand and you'll be able to power your cell phone for a solid week when civilization finally collapses.</li>
<li>Lithium-polymer USB batteries are rechargeable, pack a lot of juice, are compact and lightweight, and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/Power-Bank-Battery-Charger-Universal-USB-Backup-Portable-External-Pack-2600mAh-/171503255918?pt=US_Cell_Phone_PDA_Chargers&amp;var=&amp;hash=item27ee64016e">can now be had for less than ten bucks</a>. They're ideal for costumes, and they often wind up being useful cellphone supplements after the holiday. Their downside is complexity. USB power is always 5 volts. That's not enough for a 12 volt LED strip. Chaining these batteries together isn't a great idea, either. There are already electronics in play in those enclosures; and anyway 12 isn't divisible by 5. We need a way to turn 5 volts into 12.</li>
</ul>
<p>Boost converters do this pretty efficiently, and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/DC-DC-Adjustable-Step-up-boost-Power-Converter-Module-XL6009-Replace-LM2577-/310717070508?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&amp;hash=item48582e3cac">cost just a few dollars on eBay</a>. You'll need a few more things to use them, though: wirecutters, a USB cable you don't mind ruining, and a multimeter. This last tool might sound intimidating, but <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/DT830B-Digital-Voltmeter-Ammeter-Multimeter/dp/B005KGCI0Y/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1417390547&amp;sr=8-5&amp;keywords=multimeter">a crappy $10 multimeter</a> will work just fine.</p>
<p>At this point your mission is to cut the USB cord in half and expose conductive portions of its four wires. Plug the USB connector into the battery and use the multimeter's probes to test the wires until you find a pair that gives you a reading close to 5 volts (it might not be exact, but it should be within a tenth of a volt or two). If your USB cable was designed by good people, these wires will be red and black, like the probes of your multimeter almost certainly are. But maybe they won't be. I'll assume they are.</p>
<p>Disconnect the USB plug from the battery. Then solder the USB wires onto the boost converter. Red is positive; black is ground. They go to the IN(+) and IN(-) solder terminals of your boost converter, respectively.</p>
<p>Now reconnect the cable to the battery and use the multimeter to probe the output terminals of the boost converter. There'll be tiiiiny screw on top of a plastic box on the boost converter. Turn it while reading the measurement from the multimeter until it reads twelve. It can be tough to do all of this with only two hands, so finding someone to help is recommended.</p>
<p>Once your boost converter is set to twelve volts, you can solder your LED strip's connection to the output terminals. Simple.</p>
<p>You can avoid the multimeter hassle by buying <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/DC-4-35V-LM2577-Adjustable-Boost-Step-up-Converter-Red-LED-Voltmeter-12V-24V-/351216675095?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&amp;hash=item51c6252917">one of these units</a> and using its integrated display to set the voltage.</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="/static/2014/11/Screen-Shot-2014-11-30-at-6.38.23-PM.png"><img alt="image2" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2853" src="/static/2014/11/Screen-Shot-2014-11-30-at-6.38.23-PM-300x250.png" style="width: 300px; height: 250px;" /></a></p>
<p>This is both more expensive and a waste of energy (the display will remain on while powering your costume). It's also not something I've personally tried -- I've only used these to step down voltage from 12 to 5, not to step it up. I think it should work, but I can't make any guarantees.Either way you'll need to chop up a USB cable. And a basic multimeter is a handy thing to have around.</p>

<div class="section" id="how-much-power">
<h2>How Much Power?</h2>
<p>It's a drag, but if you're powering more than a dozen LEDs, you should do at least a <em>little</em> math to ensure longevity and safety. Batteries can get dangerously hot when they're drained quickly. Besides, you wouldn't want to run out of power before the end of the party, would you?</p>
<p>We're concerned with amperage -- milliamperage, to be more precise. A liberal estimate of an individual LED's power consumption is 30 milliamps. This level of current draw, held for an hour, equals 30 milliamp-hours (mAH). Conveniently, this is also the unit that battery capacity is measured in.</p>
<p>If your battery assembly's output is 12 volts, the math is really easy: just divide the mAH rating of a your alkaline battery type by the number of LEDs in use multiplied by 30. A typical AA battery might hold 1200 mAH (check the label). Given that rating, a 12-volt assembly of them (8 in series) could power 40 LEDs for an hour.</p>
<p>If you're using a single lead-acid battery, it's just the same, except your battery's capacity might be measured in <em>amp</em>-hours. One amp-hour equals 1000 milliamp-hours. That means a 6 amp-hour lead-acid battery could power 200 LEDs for an hour.</p>
<p>With varying voltages, like we'll encounter with a USB lithium battery, things get slightly trickier, but only slightly. We need to figure things out in terms of energy, not just current -- that means watts, which are amps times voltage. Here's how it works out:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">(5 volts * USB battery milliamp hours) / (12 volts * number of LEDs * 30 milliamp-hours)</div>
<div class="line">=</div>
<div class="line">number of LEDs</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>The boost converter we use with the USB battery isn't perfectly efficient, so we should include a fudge factor. Let's be conservative and say it's only 90% efficient:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">(0.9 * 5 volts * USB battery milliamp hours) / (12 volts * number of LEDs * 30 milliamp-hours)</div>
<div class="line">=</div>
<div class="line">number of LEDs</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>A small USB lithium battery might hold 2400 mAH (the packaging will usually say). Using the above math, that means such a battery could power 30 LEDs for an hour.</p>
<p>Of course, you probably want to power your costume for more than an hour. In fact, you should make sure of it: asking a battery to dump all of its power in an hour is fairly aggressive, and might make it heat up more than is comfortable or wise. Use the above to figure out the capacity you need per hour, then double it. Remember, you can always swap out batteries. Or, for the alkaline and lead-acid otions, you can increase capacity by adding more cells in parallel (don't do this with the USB lithium option -- just plug a new one in, or power different sections of LEDs from different batteries).</p>
<p>The above estimates are conservative. Boost converters are generally more than 90% efficient, and the types of LEDs I'm suggesting you use generally draw 15 or 20 milliamps, not 30. But it's good to employ a generous fudge factor. I've always been pleasantly surprised by how long my batteries hold out. You'll probably want to give your rig a test run before the party, anyway.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="fading">
<h2>Fading</h2>
<p>The first time I tried to dim the LEDs in a Halloween costume it didn't work very well. I had attached a potentiometer: a knob that can add resistance to a circuit when you turn it. Increasing the resistance lowers the voltage that gets to the LEDs. A lower voltage does dim LEDs, but the behavior isn't very smooth. At first the change is almost imperceptible, then it's very sudden, and then the LEDs just turn off completely. This is because LEDs emit photons in response to voltage in a nonlinear way; even worse, humans perceive brightness in response to number of photons in a nonlinear way.</p>
<p>The solution is not to alter the brightness of the LED, but to change its duty cycle: how much of the time it's turned on. If an LED is only turned on every third microsecond, it will appear 33% as bright as if it were on steadily. LEDs turn on and off very quickly, so it's easy to make them strobe so fast that the human eye can't notice the flicker.</p>
<p>The way to do this is beyond an introductory blog post, but the short answer is: a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/5PCS-New-IRF740-Power-MOSFET-N-Channel-10A-400V-/321524795852?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_2&amp;hash=item4adc5f09cc">MOSFET</a>, an <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/New-ATMEAG328-5V-16Mhz-Replace-ATmega168-For-Arduino-Pro-Mini-Compatible-Nano-/191117208428?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&amp;hash=item2c7f792b6c">Arduino</a>, and the <a class="reference external" href="http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/analogWrite">analogWrite()</a> function. The first two can be had for less than $5 combined, and the last is free. If you decide to try this but have no idea what you're doing, get in touch with me and I'll try to help.</p>
<p>A nice side-effect: by adding an Arduino you can easily start programming strobing or fading effects. You could even make your costume respond to the partygoers around you.</p>

<div class="section" id="el-wire">
<h2>EL Wire</h2>
<p>LEDs aren't your only options for lighting a costume. Electroluminescent <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/US-5M-16ft-Flexible-EL-Wire-Neon-LED-Light-Rope-Party-Car-Decorati-BATTERY-PACK-/271509438262?pt=US_String_Lights_Fairy_Lights&amp;var=&amp;hash=item3f37393f36">wire</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/1-4m-electroluminescent-strip-with-lead-wire-connector-48-EL-tape-light-lamp-/121268322259?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&amp;var=&amp;hash=item1c3c27bfd3">strips</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10799">panels</a> are fairly cheap and generally come with their electrical systems prebuilt, thanks to their unusual power requirements (very high voltage and frequency alternating current at very low amperages). Those power supplies generally run off of just one or two alkaline batteries and can last for many hours.</p>
<p>The downside to EL systems is how difficult they are to manipulate. EL wire and panels can be cut, but they can't be spliced without unusual tools and more skill than I can muster. The power supplies also tend to be made cheaply, and when they are they emit a quiet but high-pitched whine which might be annoying in environments that are supposed to be silent and spooky, like a haunted house.</p>

                    <p>And you shouldn't let anyone tell you otherwise!</p>
<p>I'm prompted to write this by my friend Tim Lee's new piece on Vox: <a class="reference external" href="http://www.vox.com/2014/8/22/6043635/5-reasons-we-shouldnt-worry-about-super-intelligent-computers-taking">Will artificial intelligence destroy humanity? Here are 5 reasons not to worry.</a> It is characteristically smart, but I disagree with most of it.</p>
<p>Tim's first and second points concern the difficulty of interfacing artificial minds with the physical world. This is accurate, but decreasingly so. The internet now provides programmatic means by which I can command a huge variety of commercial activity (Amazon, Uber, Push for Pizza); puts most of the people on Earth within easy communication range (email, SMS, POTS); and, in rich countries, is increasingly connected to ubiquitous telemetry (traffic cams, fitbit, mobile phone location trackers).</p>
<p>Progress in robotics seems to be accelerating, and is still temporarily constrained by discontinuities between the field's capabilities and its market size. There are only so many buyers for automotive welding robots and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1czBcnX1Ww">creepy robot dogs</a>, after all. The consumer market is currently mostly about robot vacuum cleaners that sort of work. But we're on the cusp of ubiquitous robot cars, and it seems plausible that geriatric caregiver bots will be viable in my lifetime. If a machine intelligence has a strong desire to interact with the real world (which it might not), it's hard to imagine the physical interface remaining a substantial obstacle for much longer.</p>
<p>The third bullet is the meatiest, but also runs into the most problems:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Digital computers are capable of emulating the behavior of other digital computers because computers function in a precisely-defined, deterministic way. To simulate a computer, you just have to carry out the sequence of instructions that the computer being modeled would perform.</p>
<p>The human brain isn't like this at all. Neurons are complex analog systems whose behavior can't be modeled precisely the way digital circuits can. And even a slight imprecision in the way individual neurons are modeled can lead to a wildly inaccurate model for the brain as a whole.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, neurons are complex. But their behavior seems to be computable in a <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church%E2%80%93Turing_thesis">Church-Turing</a> sort of way. You can consider digital music playback as an analogy. Music exists as a continuous and extremely complex transformation of air pressure. It is very dissimilar to how digital circuits work. But those circuits can operate so quickly that trains of on/off pulses can recreate an arbitrary piece of music perfectly. So it is, plausibly, with neurons.</p>
<p>Although brains are very complex mechanisms, it is overwhelmingly likely that you can strip out much of their functionality without any impact on their computational capacity. Most of the cells in the brain are glia, responsible for things like immune function, garbage collection and building myelin sheaths. As far as anyone knows they're just there for biological support. How abstract can you make your model's neurons before they lose any hope of spawning a mind? Nobody knows. Neurons actually <strong>are</strong> weirdly computerlike, in that an action potential firing down an axon is an all-or-nothing event. But the threshold excitation that triggers firing is manipulated in lots of subtle ways (both temporarily and over longer time periods), and no one knows how many will have to be simulated or how accurately. Still, you can certainly perform recognition tasks with highly stylized approximations of neurons.</p>
<p>It's also not clear that we need a particularly accurate simulation of the brain to create a mind. Tim:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A good analogy here is weather simulation. Physicists have an excellent understanding of the behavior of individual air molecules. So you might think we could build a model of the earth's atmosphere that predicts the weather far into the future. But so far, weather simulation has proven to be a computationally intractable problem. Small errors in early steps of the simulation snowball into large errors in later steps. Despite huge increases in computing power over the last couple of decades, we've only made modest progress in being able to predict future weather patterns.</p>
<p>Simulating a brain precisely enough to produce intelligence is a much harder problem than simulating a planet's weather patterns. There's no reason to think scientists will be able to do it in the foreseeable future.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's really hard to predict the <em>exact</em> sequence of a <em>particular</em> weather pattern. But modeling a <strong>plausible</strong> weather pattern is pretty easy. And neural systems seem to be able to operate in a really huge variety of configurations. Not only is every person's (presumably) conscious brain different, but they keep operating in mindlike ways after suffering severe alterations to their performance characteristics. Drugs! ALS! Concussions and lesions! <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_temporal_lobectomy">Lobectomies, for pete's sake!</a> Not to mention the seeming likelihood of many or most animals having substantial phenomenal experience despite wildly varying biologies. Once we figure out how to do it, there will probably be a considerable fudge factor in building minds.</p>
<p>Tim's fourth argument concerns the importance of human relationships. This is fair: there's good reason to think human social behavior is one of our most evolved and convoluted systems, and one that a machine might have a hard time figuring out quickly. But although our behavior is complex it's also fairly predictable--we have already systematized a surprisingly large amount of this knowledge in fields like marketing and political campaigning. There's every reason to think that a machine intelligence that's immune to fatigue, moodiness, territoriality, jealousy and other human social impairments could master relationship-building.</p>
<p>Tim's final point is an argument about the falling value of intelligence in a world where superintelligent machines proliferate. I'm not sure it makes a ton of sense to treat cognition as a simple commodity, but even if it does, this ignores the potentially trivial relative value of human minds in such a world.</p>
<p>It's important to remember just how lousy our neural hardware is. When a neuron fires, it does so by opening channels along its axon, which allows an uneven gradient of sodium and potassium ions (maintained by a ceaseless cellular pump) to equalize between the inside and outside of the cell. This opens up adjacent channels, flowing down the length of the axon, stimulating the release of neurotransmitters at its synapses. The whole thing takes about a millisecond, which is several million times slower than a transistor. That our brains work despite this sluggish mechanism is a testament to the power of parallel computation, of course. And neurons perform analog operations (summing excitation, for instance) that would require many transistor switchings to simulate. And there are about twenty billion neurons in the human brain.</p>
<p>So simulation isn't easy, exactly. But if a workable hardware configuration can be found, one can imagine scaling scenarios that transcend biological limits on sentience very quickly indeed. If your neurons had the switching performance of contemporary transistors, you could plausibly experience two lifetimes in an hour. You'd also be able to throw away a bunch of subsystems devoted to autonomic processes and other unnecessary biological and social functions, simplifying the problem further.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>I have no idea if we'll build machine intelligences. I think it's pretty likely that consciousness is an epiphenomenon free-riding on top of a powerful neural network, and that some aspect of causally isolated panpsychism is a basic component of the universe. But there's a mystic in me that wants the real source of our minds to retreat away from our plausible guesses.</p>
<p>I think he'll be disappointed, though. If we do create a thinking machine, it's hard to imagine what it will want or do. It will be designed by our hands, not by evolutionary processes. So I don't think there's any particular reason to expect it to want to reproduce or grow or consolidate power or even avoid death. Perhaps it will have no volition at all.</p>
<p>But if it does constitute a conscious being in a way that we can relate to, I think we should expect to be surpassed by it pretty quickly. Whether that presages extinction, irrelevance or transcendence, I couldn't say. But it's certainly going to be a big deal.</p>

                    <p>For the last four weeks I've been teaching an Intro to Arduino class at Sunlight. It's been fun! I'm hopeful that the participants have gotten a new hobby out of it.

<p>It's safe to say that this curriculum isn't too different from other Arduino classes. The extent to which it relies on the sample code that ships with the Arduino IDE is proof enough of that. But in my experience the hardest-won pieces of knowledge in any technical hobby are the bits of folk knowledge that don't rise to the level of Timeless Principle. What vendors have the best deals? What's the name of that kind of connector? Which stuff do I <em>really</em> need to know, and which stuff is just there because the instructor thinks it's good for me?</p>
<p>I tried to focus on these questions in the notes attached to these slides. Hopefully you'll find them useful! Based on student response, I think that lesson 3 needs some touch-up work for non-Python users, but otherwise they're probably in pretty okay shape.</p>

                    <p>Last week we interviewed a candidate who we really liked but who was much too green. He asked for some advice, so here's what I wrote -- might as well put it online. Hopefully it's a little more specific and opinionated than these things tend to be.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>It was a real pleasure to meet you, but your instincts are right: at this point we have to invest in people with a bit more experience under their belts. I do want to stress, though, that your enthusiasm and interest in software engineering came through clearly, and made us all enthusiastic about the developer you will no doubt become.</p>
<p>Toward that end, let me offer a little more advice than I usually put into these sorts of emails:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Pick a technology and invest time in it. There is tremendous value to understanding the repetition of patterns across engineering domains, but you need to gain deep expertise in one before you can do so effectively.</li>
<li>I'll be more specific: pick one of these technologies -- Ruby, Python, Node/Javascript. All have vibrant open source communities from which you can learn a lot for free. All have bustling job markets. All have bindings in a huge variety of domains. All are abstract and widely supported and will spare you many of lower-level languages' headaches. All have robust web frameworks. Personally, I'd suggest Python, because it is the most stable and widely supported. It's everywhere-- it is Google's noncompiled language of choice, for instance, and widely used in scientific computing and a huge number of other areas. But its community is less fun and accessible than the others, and it's more sedate. The others will take you on a wilder ride, but you will probably have to learn things a few times as the community changes its mind about how to solve a problem. This is extra true for Node and less so for Ruby -- which reflects each community's age.</li>
<li>There is a premium for mobile dev work, but I wouldn't invest in that right now because it's too specialized to be a great way to learn. Also iOS will be in turmoil thanks to Swift, and Java dev is a drag outside the genuinely-exciting opportunities of Android.</li>
<li>Focus on the web and the key tasks associated with it. Skim the topics that other languages' web frameworks cover -- they all solve the same problems in slightly different ways. Invest a little time in learning jQuery -- being able to build out web templates is a very plausible starter job, and one you can get good at fast. Also, make a point of learning regular expressions and the network libraries and functions necessary for using APIs.</li>
<li>You do not need to know much about data structures, compiler design, sorting algorithms, recursion or most of the other things that they teach you in a CS program.</li>
<li>Microsoft technologies can earn you money but will never fully integrate with the world of open source software, which is where the best engineers and most exciting projects exist. I have written Visual Basic for a living; I don't think you should write any more of it. The .NET frameworks are okay but basically a less-open version of Java. Everyone hates Java.</li>
<li>I wrote PHP for many years professionally and still think it is a cheap, useful tool. It gets zero respect in programming circles, though -- I would not suggest spending more time learning it until/unless you have mastered something more prestigious and just want it for quick personal projects.</li>
<li>You should probably learn with a good text editor (but not an IDE) and the command line as your primary tools. On OS X I like Sublime Text 2. Speaking of which: you should be developing on OS X or Linux (people around here tend to favor Ubuntu or Mint). If you're on Windows now this will be painful, but you will never fully connect with the open source world and its idioms unless you get used to the *nix command line interface.</li>
<li>There is no substitute for working with engineers who are better than you are. This is tough until you get yourself hired somewhere, though! On the far end there are code bootcamps, but those cost money. On the near end there are technical meetups -- shop around and find one that seems technical enough to teach you things. Contributing to open source projects is a good idea, too --&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2014/05/13/why-weve-collected-a-hojillion-inspector-general-reports/">writing an IG scraper for Sunlight might be an approachable task</a>&nbsp;(he said selfishly). Online tutorials can take you a long way if you put in the time.</li>
<li>Get active on Github! Follow how people like Eric Mill (&#64;konklone) and Tom Macwright (&#64;tmcw) and Josh Tauberer (&#64;govtrack) do their work. Recognize that filing tickets is a valid way to contribute, as long as they are well-informed. It doesn't have to all be pull requests.</li>
<li>Master the art of googling for error messages. Using search engines, Stack Exchange, mailing lists and IRC properly to uncover unknown answers is maybe the most important skill in real-life programming.</li>
<li>Once you identify superstar programmers, follow them on Twitter or their blogs. The writing of people like Ian Bicking will get you familiar with the cultural context surrounding your programming language of choice. Speaking of which: conferences can be pricey but once you're ready they can be a really good way to learn -- if you pick the right one. Pycon is excellent. I know less about the other languages' marquee cons.</li>
<li>Spend some time reading about diversity in technology. The situation is not good, and a lot of people are working very hard to change it. This is a huge topic of discussion right now and you need to be able to talk about it intelligently.</li>
<li>If someone mentions linked data or the semantic web and they have never held a job at Google, assume they are about to waste your time.</li>
</ul>
<p>There! I think that's all the advice I can come up with for someone in your shoes. Ask me questions when you have them. And good luck.</p>

                    <p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="/static/2014/05/things.gif"><img alt="things" class="alignright wp-image-2808" src="/static/2014/05/things.gif" style="width: 319px; height: 294px;" /></a>Wired makes <a class="reference external" href="http://www.wired.com/2014/05/iot-report/">a yeoman's effort</a> at turning a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2014/05/14/internet-of-things/">basically boring Pew report about the Internet of Things</a> into something worth wringing your hands over. If you actually read the report, the experts seem much less worried (and quite a bit less compelling) than Wired wants us to think.</p>
<p>Partly this is because only a few of them seem to know much about it. There are a lot of very impressive people on the list of respondents, but at a glance they seem to mostly be drawn from the Internet's Elder Statesperson class. And this IoT business has less to do with the internet than the name implies--it's really about hardware, sensors and microcontrollers. So we wind up with some warmed-over and implausible futurism from the guy who runs the Webbys.</p>
<p>I think the milquetoast ambivalence flows from this: we understand what we're facing. We've been at this industrial revolution business for a while now, and it's mostly apparent how it works. We've all lived through the advent and democratization of various manufactured technological conveniences, and we are confident both of their steady pace and their limited capacity for delivering transcendence. Consumerism: we get it.</p>
<p>This was not the case with software! Infinite abundance, communication and human potential -- you could tell a really amazing (and, alas, often overblown) story about what this would mean for all sorts of social institutions. Something truly new was happening, emergent forces were emerging, and nobody could tell how it was going to end. It was unclear why your boss was paying for you to get drunk at SXSWi but he <em>was</em> and it was <em>awesome</em> and everything was surely about to change.</p>
<p>This is not the case with the Internet of Things. With the exceptions of miniaturized-yet-affordable PCB manufacturing and solid state accelerometers, most of the central technologies have been achievable for a while. They just haven't been used. For example, the idea of a home thermostat you can set from your office is sort of neat, but <a class="reference external" href="http://www.diycontrols.com/c-175-phone-thermostats.aspx">such products have existed for decades</a>. Why are we excited about this now? Well, prices have dropped, the gadget-purchasing habit has been solidified, and control interfaces have improved (thanks, smartphones). Ubiquity is newly practical.</p>
<p>But we still don't have many really compelling stories about what it's all going to do for us. The benefits to these use cases are known, or at least can be imagined. It's nice to have a door open itself for you or an alarm clock that knows when you're sleepy, but how much is it really worth? We've been able to network appliances for quite a while. We did it a long time ago for cardiac monitors in hospitals, because in that application it's worth the money. Giving your fridge an IPv6 address? We can certainly do it, and we probably will. But don't kid yourself about the scale of the benefits that will flow from this innovation.</p>
<p>(One exception: the quantified self movement *does* have a bunch of compelling stories about gigantic improvements to health that careful self-measurement can deliver. Given the enormous amounts of money we invest in not-very-effective healthcare interventions, it seems safe to say that if this idea could deliver a fraction of what it's being used to promise, our failure to implement it already would represent one of the greatest market failures in history.)</p>
<p>I love playing around with hardware, so don't mistake my skepticism about IoT futurism for a lack of enthusiasm. Filling the objects around us with dancing grains of sand that we've etched with runes and whispers of ions, so that they might ceaselessly observe and manipulate the environment for our convenience: I think that's a lovely thing for a species to do, and often a pretty fun art project. And I suppose emergent network effects are always possible. Seems a little far-fetched to me, though, at least so long as we're mostly talking about thermostats and pedometers. But my imagination is admittedly terrible.</p>
<p>I'll boil it down to a few things, I guess:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The adoption of ubiquitous computing is a function of physical technology's ever-falling price versus the benefit it confers. There are many applications enabled by lower prices that are just now achieving market viability. But that's because their benefit is meager, not because the tech was impossibly pricey. This may not be universally true, but it's probably true for the anticipated uses that are currently being used to sell this phenomenon: quantified self and home automation.</li>
<li>Concerns about maintaining the software in a zillion different devices seem legit (though people are underestimating just how awful embedded tech can get away with being, and overestimating both the incentives facing bad actors and the threat surface present on devices that are designed to be *extremely* limited). Partly for this reason, functions will continue to accrue to your phone whenever possible (we're running low on compelling sensors at the moment, but IR photography and laser rangefinding might sell some iPhones). <a class="reference external" href="http://www.vox.com/2014/5/8/5590228/how-tiny-computers-could-change-the-way-we-live">Some will try to achieve a profitable, lock-in-driven business through proprietary solutions to this headache, but I doubt they'll succeed</a>.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="/2013/05/02/project-glass-is-scary-enough-to-deserve-some-respect/">The most interesting questions surrounding these issues concern transhumanism</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> You know, I did leave off one huge thing--the sharing economy (with apologies to Tom Slee). Uber, Bixi, AirBnB--using technology for access control really is only recently possible, thanks to the evolution of IT payment and identity systems. And it really can make our collective use of property hugely different and better.</p>

                    <p>Panama: pretty great. The Panama City aesthetic is the first thing that strikes you on the drive from the airport: chrome and colorful and BIG, with absurdly distracting animated LED brake lights sprinkled throughout. Optimus Prime was designed by a Panamanian, I'm sure of it.</p>
<p>They are mostly not kidding around about the whole not-speaking-English thing, but otherwise I think you can safely count Panama as an absurdly American-friendly travel destination. This is probably pretty obvious -- after all, we're responsible for spurring Panamanian independence from Colombia, they use American currency, and the School of the Americas boasted both Panamanian facilities (now a resort!) and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.soaw.org/about-the-soawhinsec/soawhinsec-grads/notorious-grads/243-notorious-graduates-from-panama">graduates</a>.</p>
<p>Honestly, what's most striking is how benign this history of meddling currently seems. At the moment, at least, the country is prosperous, proud and happy. <a class="reference external" href="http://instagram.com/p/mwfWFFpIi8/">Panama City is an impressive, cosmopolitan place</a>. A tourist's perspective can't be trusted, and we didn't venture toward the more dangerous Colombian border, but driving through a large chunk of the country without seeing any real human suffering must count for at least something. The experience made me feel uneasily comfortable with American hegemony -- though it was well timed for our burgeoning Cold War resumption, I suppose. Probably I'll eventually be deeply embarrassed to have thought this, but for now: things seem like they've worked out.</p>
<p>Otherwise? The canal is pretty cool. Santa Catalina is a lovely little surf town. The coffee is sadly not as good as Panamanians think (mostly because they don't brew it strongly enough), but the hats seem legit. Panama City is very impressive, and Casco Viejo is particularly lovely. Boquete was a lush respite from the heat (though its animals failed to cooperate with our hiking plans). We fucked our rental car up pretty good. All in all, a great vacation.</p>

                    <p>Reentering an NCAA bracket across multiple sites drives me nuts -- it's an obvious data format problem that could be solved very simply.</p>
<p>I used to think the incompatibility was deliberate, designed to capture audiences and keep them staring at a given sports site. Now I'm not so sure. The bracket functionality doesn't try to extract all that much value from us, to be honest -- these things are sponsored, sure. But there's a definite whiff of sports fan developers taking advantage of principal agent dynamics to simply build sportsy things.</p>
<p>But even if the incentives for compatibility aren't completely backward, the mayfly lifespan of bracket sites makes coordination difficult. Last year, after the tournament ended, I spent a few minutes emailing and tweeting at developers who seemed to have worked on the highest-profile bracket sites, but I received no responses.</p>
<p>So for now, bracket compatibility remains a pipe dream. It's a shame, though, because the problem is a simple one. I used to think about this in terms of JSON data formats, files that you would download and upload between sites. But it can be handled much more efficiently. There are only 64 + 32 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 127 games, after all (let's ignore the play-ins for a moment, since most bracket sites do). Each game has a binary outcome. That's 127 bits of data.</p>
<p>Decisions about encoding that data can be made arbitrarily; they just have to be agreed upon. Getting the order of games correct, from 0 to 126, is essential. It doesn't really matter how you do it, but here's one scheme that would work.</p>
<p>For each region (ordered alphabetically, A-Z); then for each round (low to high); assume the highest-ranked seed wins -- no upsets -- and assign games consecutive numbers, from highest seed to lowest. Tiebreakers fall back to the alphabetical region name ordering.</p>
<p>You now have 127 ordered slots to fill with ones and zeros. 1 encodes a win for a higher-numbered seed; 0 an upset. In cases of identical seeding, 1 encodes the team from the region with the alphabetically-first name.</p>
<p>Here's some Python that demonstrates how the resulting sequence of bits could be assembled and encoded into an easily transportable string:</p>
<p><code><p>import random, base64</p>
</p><div class="line-block">
<div class="line">def retrieve_winner(game_number):</div>
<div class="line">return random.choice((0, 1))</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">picks = 0</div>
<div class="line">pick_bytes = []</div>
<div class="line">for i in xrange(0, 128):</div>
<div class="line">picks = (picks &lt;&lt; 1) | retrieve_winner(i)</div>
<div class="line">if (i % 8)==7:</div>
<div class="line">pick_bytes.append(picks &amp; 255)</div>
<div class="line">picks = 0</div>
</div>
<p>print base64.b64encode(''.join(map(lambda x: chr(x), pick_bytes)))</p>
<p>This just makes random picks, but you could easily connect retrieve_winner() to a web interface. The output is something like &quot;IXNcAyp72iGVl9iGE4i4FA==&quot; (those trailing equal signs can be dispensed with), which is easily portable through email or twitter or copying and pasting. If you want it to be easily readable over the phone, you could change that &quot;b64encode&quot; to &quot;b32encode&quot; and get an all-caps string like &quot;EFZVYAZKPPNCDFMX3CDBHCFYCQ======&quot; -- that's only four meaningful characters longer (you have to chop off a few more ='s). Bracket tiebreakers -- usually the total score of the championship game -- could be added for a cost of 4 or 5 more characters.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I hate CBSSports.com</p>

The search for more meaningful measures of media efficacy is interesting in its own right. But I think the structural incentives that surround it deserve some attention, too.</p>
<p>It's worth reflecting on the metrics that have fallen out of style: most notably conversions (how often an online message leads directly to a measurable action) and impressions (how often an online message is seen, perhaps affecting the viewer unconsciously). For the past few years there has been an outsize focus on the level of social activity spurred by a message -- though this kind of result is <a class="reference external" href="http://philanthropynewsdigest.org/news/social-network-support-for-causes-may-be-limited-study-finds">increasingly</a> viewed as a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/2/14/5411934/youre-not-going-to-read-this">overvalued</a>. In the past few months, there has been growing enthusiasm, including at Sunlight, for measures of how thoroughly a message is considered by its viewer. Upworthy's <a class="reference external" href="http://blog.upworthy.com/post/75795679502/what-uniques-and-pageviews-leave-out-and-why-were">attention minutes</a> metric is leading the charge -- unsurprisingly, given the organization's undeniable sophistication at measuring and driving traffic.</p>
<p>Although it would be hard to completely deny a fad dynamic to these successive waves of focus, I think efforts to find better analytics have been driven by good intentions. But I also think these efforts may be leading us to a different future than many imagine. For instance, I wonder if my colleague Eric is mistaking a feature for a bug here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/1uigi">&#64;1uigi</a> one nice thing about pageviews/visits: it's clear how they work. Proprietary &quot;secret sauce&quot; replacements would be bad (and unlikely).</p>
<p class="attribution">&mdash;Eric Mill (&#64;konklone) <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/konklone/statuses/445941858104254465">March 18, 2014</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p><p>I can see why Eric thinks black-box metrics would be bad. But the bespoke nature of the new, increasingly in-house analytics trends carries advantages for those creating them. And this isn't the first time that content creators have evolved toward capturing the mechanisms by which their own success is measured. A little over three years ago, before many of the aforementioned analytics trends occurred, <a class="reference external" href="/2010/12/05/more-efficiency-means-less-profit/">I wrote this</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[B]y all accounts online advertising doesn’t work very well. You can measure whether someone clicks on an ad, and often whether they buy something after that click. But it turns out they rarely do those things. So businesses aren’t willing to pay very much for ad space on websites.</p>
<p>Is it really a coincidence that the advertising medium with the best instrumentation also appears to be the least effective? I suspect it’s not. It may be that ads never worked as well as the industry had told us; or it may be that the eyeballs/clicks/conversions funnel is a naive conceptualization of how the system works. Either way, Google has succeeded by giving advertisers what they think they want, which is analytic tools that seem to reveal that the whole enterprise is horribly ineffective.</p>
<p>I think the push for better tools and more efficient ads is basically a race to the bottom. In fact, less perfect instrumentation might allow the ad industry to capture a bit more revenue from business thanks to decreased efficiency.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The lure of incomparability is very strong. Forget Google AdWords for a moment. Big ad buys are still largely arranged by salespeople, working on commission, making phone calls. And how could it be otherwise, for people in the business of convincing other people? Having objective, universal measures of efficacy is not helpful to that kind of endeavor. Much better to have a measure that works for you, that people are excited about, and that you control. It could just as easily be <a class="reference external" href="http://www.altweeklies.com/aan/the-media-oxpecker-do-current-reporting-rules-make-circulation-stats-meaningless/Article?oid=6159205">manipulable circulation numbers</a> as a boutique web metric.</p>
<p>This case can be overstated. As I've said, I think people are largely working on these problems in good faith -- particularly at outfits like Upworthy, which focus on a social mission; or the journalists I know who have left comfortable jobs because they care about whether their work affects the world.</p>
<p>But the incentives for a metrics <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Babel#Enumeration_of_scattered_languages">Tower of Babel</a> are real. To some degree, they're even admirable, insofar as they're driven by varying conceptions of success. Is my goal to make my audience think deeply, talk loudly, or spend freely? All of these can change the world for the better; ad-buyers' temptation to ask which is best can reasonably be resisted, even if I do a little cherry-picking to make my case.</p>
<p>Besides, if one is prepared, for a moment, to disregard the capacity for world-improvement that widely-viewed and ethically correct publications represent, there's no real problem here. Advertising often has strongly positional aspects, determining who will come out on top but not the overall level of welfare (a world in which Pepsi is the number one cola may strike some as more dystopian than it does me). Not only that, advertising is in some ways a force that directly opposes human agency -- it's designed, quite explicitly, to turn dollars into altered desires and behavior. I have limited enthusiasm for the kind of improved instrumentation that might let us hone that weapon's edge even further.</p>
<p>In its most benign form, advertising is a tax on industry that flows according to influences too numerous to understand. There's an appeal to the idea of rationalizing this process, of making it measurable, quantitative and objective -- making it legible, as James Scott might put it. It seems like the result would be more fair. And admittedly, the human systems that make up the alternative are not fair: they're sexist, racist and elitist.</p>
<p>But I suppose I'm optimistic that those systems don't have to stay that way. And keeping advertisers confused about what they're buying might preserve room for some wonderful things. So three cheers for analytic innovation -- even if the innovators aren't wholly aware of what they're doing.</p>

                    <p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://corpsmoderne.itch.io/flappy-space-program"><img alt="flappy_space_small" class="alignright size-full wp-image-2764" src="/static/2014/02/flappy_space_small.gif" style="width: 350px; height: 311px;" /></a>In a tab not far from this one, a small bird orbits an 8-bit Earth on a ceaseless elliptical. I put him there, and feel a certain pride about it. <a class="reference external" href="http://corpsmoderne.itch.io/flappy-space-program">You should launch some birds, too</a>, if only to remind yourself that physics is pretty weird.</p>
<p>Too much has been written about Flappy Bird, but I'm going to pile on anyway: it reminds me of a conversation I've had with <a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/kristoncapps">Kriston</a> (and more recently <a class="reference external" href="http://bergmayer.info/">John Bergmayer</a>). Kriston was complaining about some not-that-great book that was sucking up a ton of public attention. These people could be reading the classics! he said. Or just last year's much-better crop of novels!</p>
<p>I agreed with him about the objective merits of whatever book it was, but I stuck up for fad-chasing. There's something great about having everyone settle on a single conversation for a week or two, applying all their capacity for inventive criticism, clever jokes and feedback loops of enthusiasm. Faced with exile on a desert island, I could assemble a media library that was very self-edifying. Faced with participation in culture, I'm happy enough to watch the new season of <em>House of Cards</em> even though <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nationaljournal.com/politics/the-hate-watchers-guide-to-house-of-cards-season-2-20140214">it's sort of garbage</a>. I keep an eye on new album releases for the same reason, even as experience makes each band's influences and lack of invention clearer.</p>
<p><em>Flappy Bird</em> is compelling for a number of reasons, foremost among them the narrative surrounding its author and the ineffable appeal of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.gamespy.com/articles/112/1124913p1.html">a game with neurologically agreeable physics</a>. But I'm also really enjoying it as a cultural rallying point: the <a class="reference external" href="http://corpsmoderne.itch.io/flappy-space-program">aforementioned orbit game</a>, the <a class="reference external" href="http://flapmmo.com/">MMO</a>, the <a class="reference external" href="http://flappybirdthinkpieces.tumblr.com/">essays</a>.</p>
<p>Admittedly, this is because, so far, the conversation is mostly among people who enjoy essays and indie games -- for me, this is a comfortably skintight demographic. One doesn't have to look far to find <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=sr_nr_n_25?rh=n%3A1036592%2Ck%3Aangry+birds&amp;keywords=angry+birds&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1392393996&amp;rnid=2941120011">other, grosser avian videogame phenomena</a>.</p>
<p>But for now, and maybe for the rest of its run, it's something everyone can talk about.</p>

<p>There are not a lot of flights into Goa, but one of them comes directly from Moscow. This explains a lot. The beach is full of unhealthy-looking Russian women and their monolithic husbands, whose hairless, pressurized torsos pivot atop speedos like artillery turrets. In the afternoon they are as drunk and passed out as our xenophobic cold war stereotypes have promised. Just like those topless glamor shots of Vladimir Putin, theirs is a virile aesthetic almost completely divorced from physical beauty. I've found Goa to be a very agreeable place to be carrying ten spare pounds of holiday weight.</p>
<p>But perhaps this is just Baga Beach, where we stayed. A day trip to Anjuna, the purported center of Goan hippie culture, revealed even fewer Russians than hippies. The people on the beach seemed athletic and competent and not in the mood for anybody's shit. Absurdly, there were even a few joggers. The Bob Marley towels and offers of drugs seemed mostly about delivering the local color promised in the guidebooks. Anjuna is an American beach, a beach from which conference calls have been joined.</p>
<p>Seasides are timeless. The surf is perpetual, very nearly immune to seasons and human meddling. Shells and driftwood and sand are relentlessly ground down in a process that clearly does not require much supervision. Everything about the ocean is, frankly, much too big.</p>
<p>I used to like to sit in front of it and (pretentiously) read Calvino and feel as tiny and quiet and unnoticeable as a stone buried in the sand beyond the breakers. But that was years ago, when my self-regard was still immaculate. Pondering mortality and insignificance was a nice vacation experience once upon a time, but was never any more life-changing than a cooking class.</p>
<p>It's less fun now. I'm no pebble, I'm just part of a huge herd of mammals, wallowing in the surf and shade and beer like everyone else. It's certainly still relaxing, but regular life has lost its childish grandiosity and so the old idea of escape feels a bit more desperate. How can you relax when, back home, entropy is increasing?</p>
<p>I went into the Indian Ocean, which I never thought I'd do. The sand was smooth and the waves were like bath water. Soon I found myself amid some Indian boys who were bodysurfing.</p>
<p>Where are you from? USA. He was going there soon, he said, to work for a new company, had I heard of it. I was sorry, I hadn't. He told me how many lakhs he was going to make. I wished him luck, which his friends thought was funny. I started to head out further and they asked me if I could swim. I told them yes; they seemed disappointed.</p>
<p>My cousins were born here. Or maybe that's not right. Were they raised here? I can't remember. One day they arrived at my grandparents' house on Kenmore Street, in Virginia, so that the process of civilizing them could begin. Within weeks my cousin Emily gave herself a haircut, which became an important chapter in subsequent family lore and cemented a sense of wildness that was probably undeserved.</p>
<p>Why did my aunt go to India, and why did she come back? I've never been told and have certainly never asked. I imagine that she was, like many others of her generation, attempting an experiment. Sometimes I worry that its failure has disappointed her since.</p>
<p>My cousins seem none the worse for it, though. They are now implacable Vermonters, wise and capable and, if one insisted on naming a fault, perhaps even too strong for their own good. Just like their grandmother, and her grandmother. A generational displacement as geographically and culturally vast as possible couldn't dislodge their destiny. At times I find this immensely reassuring.</p>

                    <p>The guidebooks try to be polite about it, but they don't have many compliments for Bangalore. They have to admit it's not great for temples or monuments or palaces. But they hasten to note that it's clean! And wealthy! If Lonely Planet were about Victorian ladies instead of cities, Bangalore's fluency in French and skill at the pianoforte would be discussed extensively.</p>
<p>This city has been gentler to me than I'd been told to expect. There is dizzying traffic and choking smog, but it's navigable. There is horrible poverty and software-driven wealth -- authors of Medium posts about San Francisco's spiritual destruction via Google Shuttle will find much to like -- but so far my heart is only being broken once every ten miles or so. The taxi drivers don't seem to see enough tourists to know how to properly gouge us. And gastrointestinally, I am at the part of the cartoon where the coyote opens a clenched eye and begins to chuckle nervously, thinking the bomb must be a dud.</p>
<p>So I'm not as overwhelmed as I might be. But the experience has still been satisfyingly foreign.</p>
<p>I finished rereading <em>Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr. Norrel</em> shortly after landing, and this passage seemed about right:</p>
<blockquote>
They had been recommended to a hotel in Shoemaker-street which belonged to a Mr Prideaux, a Cornishman. Mr Prideaux's guests were almost all British officers who had just returned to Portugal from England or who were waiting for ships to take them on leave of absence. It was Mr Prideaux's intention that during their stay at his hotel the officers should feel as much at home as possible. In this he was only partly successful. Do whatsoever he might, Mr Prideaux found that Portugal continually intruded itself upon the notice of his guests. The wallpaper and furnishings of the hotel might all have been brought originally from London, but a Portuguese sun had shone on them for five years and faded them in a peculiarly Portuguese manner. Mr Prideaux might instruct the cook to prepare an English bill of fare but the cook was Portuguese and there was always more pepper and oil in the dishes than the guests expected. Even the guests' boots had a faintly Portuguese air after the Portuguese bootboy had blacked them.</blockquote>
<p>I think this unavoidable, insistent foreignness can be illuminating. There are layers to the effect.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>In the old days, before anyone knew what yeast was, styles of beer came from specific places. The critters in the air and the minerals in the water determined the options available to a brewer. That pilsners came from Pilsen was an immutable feature of the world, not just clever coordination by the Pilsen Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>Maybe foreignness begins with these biological conditions. They're no more detectable by a tourist like myself than they were to medieval brewers (although I'm told I would certainly come to notice something if I drank the tap water). But they're real and they must shape the environment surrounding me.</p>
<p>Those contrasts make me begin to wonder about how I've been shaped by similar forces at home. Sometimes, at the gym, I'll work out next to someone and notice that their sweat smells of berbere. It's a physical manifestation of how saturated they are by their culture.</p>
<p>Of course I can only detect this because my own culture is different. I'm no less steeped. Supposedly when Westerners first came to Japan, the islanders couldn't bear the visitors' stink. &quot;<a class="reference external" href="http://archive.org/stream/cu31924023222320/cu31924023222320_djvu.txt">They smell[ed] of butter and fat</a>.&quot; I wonder what I'm suffused with; what I smell like to the people here. Even my friends say that Subway stores smell awful, which is worrying.</p>
<p>The opportunity to reflect on these contrasts is what I like I like about travel (communication technology's erosion of the case for sightseeing is hugely underconsidered). But these contrasts are growing duller, aren't they? It's banal to lament the homogenizing effect of global commerce. I wouldn't want to claim there's anything principled about my supercilious yuppie dismay at the prospect of a Bangalore Baskin-Robbins.</p>
<p>But the larger phenomenon seems real enough. How distinctive can a global set of cultures remain when their TV producers are all ripping each other off at internet speed?</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Conscientious citizens of the universe will already be familiar with <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_death_of_the_universe#Current_status">the wikipedia article about its heat death</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
From the Big Bang through the present day and well into the future, matter and dark matter in the universe are thought to be concentrated in stars, galaxies, and galaxy clusters. Therefore, the universe is not in thermodynamic equilibrium and objects can do physical work.</blockquote>
<p>Why can anything happen at all? Because there's more of something in one place than another. Charge, pressure, heat -- any one of them out of equilibrium, and it's able to be harnessed for work as it seeks balance.</p>
<p>It's tempting to apply this metaphor to society: imagining that the diffusion of concentrated idiosyncrasy is the only means by which cultural invention can be pushed to an acceptable pace. The transmutation of African-American musical traditions into pop genres; the adoption of anime tropes by American filmmakers; the dizzyingly reciprocating cross-pollination that produced the Gangnam Style fad single; fusion cuisine.</p>
<p>Is cosmopolitanism another word for entropy? Is a Diplo mixtape analogous to an exploding oil tanker? This is not a cheerful idea -- it's a prediction of eventual globalized monotony and stagnation -- but it does seem compatible with <a class="reference external" href="http://www.vanityfair.com/style/2012/01/prisoners-of-style-201201">Kurt Andersen's ideas about postmodern exhaustion</a>.</p>
<p>And it could serve as a framework for understanding which parts of globalization we should resent. If cultural distinctiveness is a resource we spend it should be spent on worthwhile pursuits rather than on selling hamburgers and cola; just as we should burn petroleum to empower humanity rather than to power larger SUVs.</p>
<p>Admittedly, this idea is also compatible with an ugly primitivism. I don't mean to do that. I don't want to be tempted into imagining that India (or any place else) is some sort of wellspring of authenticity; its colonial history makes that idea laughable. Besides, it seems impolite to insist that other societies act as cures for our neuroses.</p>
<p>But if I squint I can imagine India as an engine, doing fascinating things as it burns away the divisions between east and west and other places beside. I wonder if it will ever run out of fuel.</p>

                    <p>Well, another fantasy football season is behind us. I entered the season as the reigning champion and left it as the... not champion. It would be churlish to try to make excuses for my poor showing. So instead I'll simply note that there is an ongoing, pressing need for organ donors in this country, and many of my fantasy players' families are proud to have done their part. My heartfelt congratulations to Ben on his apparent championship and the masterfully subtle campaign of cheating that must surely lie at its foundation.</p>
<p>But the season did have a few bright spots, even beyond the news that my WR1 is expected to walk again. In particular, I embarked on a semi-ridiculous project to build a Raspberry Pi-powered fantasy football meter. It worked out pretty well!</p>
<p>I should probably begin by assuring you that I'm not actually all that maniacal about fantasy football. It was a purchase that spurred this project: a few months back I bought <a class="reference external" href="http://instagram.com/p/cNGn1EvEFn/">a big lot of antique electrical gauges on eBay</a>.</p>
<p>(OK, actually I bought two lots.)</p>
<p>Since then I've been building some little projects with them using Raspberry Pis and lasercut wooden enclosures. The fantasy football meter is one of the more grandiose examples.</p>
<p>The top gauge measures my ranking in the league. The bottom gauge measures how many points ahead or behind I am at the moment. I realize that this is deeply stupid.</p>
<p>It's fair to say that I have been working to (slowly) accumulate the expertise necessary for these projects for <a class="reference external" href="http://dcist.com/2008/04/transit_on_thur_27.php">more than half a decade</a>. It's made me really, <em>really</em> wish that I had taken some electrical engineering classes in college.</p>
<p>Still, I've learned a lot during this process! So why not blog about some of those things?</p>
<div class="section" id="cut-a-hole-in-the-box">
<h2>Cut A Hole In The Box</h2>
<p>3D printing gets a lot of attention, and it is indeed frighteningly neat. But for my money a good old-fashioned robotic lasercutter is even more exciting. Anyone who has turned an IKEA flat-pack into an unattractive wine rack will be familiar with the basic principles underlying my approach.</p>
<p>Conceptualizing the transformation from two to three dimensions is trivially easy for some people and essentially impossible for others. I fall somewhere in the middle, and find that I am best served by workshopping a given geometric idea under a variety of pharmacological conditions -- specifically alcohol, caffeine and post-workout endorphines. Probably there is some nootropic cocktail available on the streets of San Francisco that delivers innovative furniture design insights and permanent synaptic damage instantaneously, but I'm uncool enough to require lengthy periods of mulling instead.</p>
<p>I would dearly love to employ interesting woodworking techniques, but working in two dimensions more or less mandates the use of <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finger_joint">finger joints</a>. And really, that's fine. The one thing you have to watch out for is <em>kerf</em>. Lasercutters work by vaporizing a small amount of material. The width of this area -- called kerf -- usually amounts to just a tenth or fifth of a millimeter, but it does add up.</p>
<p>I've written some <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/sbma44/fingerjoint">python scripts</a> to help generate finger joint geometries that account for tedious kerf calculations automatically. They do require quite a bit of fiddling and subsequent modification in Illustrator or Inkscape, but they work well enough.

But <a class="reference external" href="http://hacdc.org">HacDC</a> now has a lasercutter, and though it's less powerful, you can't beat the price and turnaround time. I'm still experimenting with materials, but have purchased a bunch of stuff from <a class="reference external" href="http://laserbits.com">laserbits.com</a> that I hope will produce good results.</p>

<h2>Raspberry Foray</h2>
<p>I've spent a lot of time playing around with Arduino, and the experience has taught me a lot. But if you want to connect to the internet -- and look at you, of course you do -- you're going to want to turn elsewhere. I spent quite a bit of time on the <a class="reference external" href="http://beagleboard.org/bone">BeagleBone</a>, and I admire its commitment to openness.</p>
<p>But there is no competing with <a class="reference external" href="http://raspberrypi.org">Raspberry Pi</a> right now. It wins on price. It wins on its choice of native distro. Most importantly, it wins on community. Next to these things, its just-OK (nongraphical) technical capabilities are afterthoughts.</p>
<p>Still, making the damn thing useful in embedded applications takes some thought! I have condensed a number of these lessons into <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/sbma44/rpi/">this repo</a>. You might want to borrow parts of it (you probably won't want all of it). Among the things the bootstrap.sh script and its siblings accomplish:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Installs Bonjour so you can get to the Pi without looking up its DHCP-delivered IP address</li>
<li>Gets a decent Python environment in place, complete with virtualenv</li>
<li>Installs the <a class="reference external" href="http://wiringpi.com/">wiringpi and wiringpi2 libraries</a>, which are what you'll want to use to control the General Purpose Input/Ouput (GPIO) pins on the device</li>
<li>Sets up my default wifi networks. Whoops! You probably don't want that. But use this <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/sbma44/rpi/blob/master/interfaces">/etc/network/interfaces</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/sbma44/rpi/blob/master/wpa_supplicant.conf">/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf</a> file templates to get yourself online. Note that you can have more than one network={} statements in the latter.</li>
<li>Gives my SSH key root on the system. You probably don't want that either.</li>
<li>Turns off the swap file. Swap files are the means by which your disk impersonates RAM to expand your system's capabilities. It's a super-neat idea in general, but less so if your disk self-destructs the more often you write to it -- which is indeed the case with a flash SD card. You should find a way to make do with physical memory. I've gone through a lot of SD cards.</li>
<li>Relatedly! And not present in this install script! You should turn off journaling in the filesystem. Instructions can be found <a class="reference external" href="http://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/169/how-can-i-extend-the-life-of-my-sd-card">here</a>. Journaling is a neat idea by which every change to the filesystem is first cached in a central location before being executed as a transaction. This allows for graceful recovery from a number of failure modes that can occur if an operation that requires multiple steps -- and which really, really needs to complete all of them for things to make sense -- is abruptly interrupted by a power loss or other failure. But that caching requires a <em>ton</em> of writes to disk, and will burn up your SD card in short order. You'll just have to get by without journaling, and commit to pulling the power as little as possible</li>
<li>The script also <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/sbma44/rpi/blob/master/watchdog.py">turns on the watchdog module</a> in the Broadcom processor that lives at the heart of the Pi. This is a little piece of hardware that listens for a heartbeat signal from the system and, if it doesn't hear one, reboots everything. Step one is turning on the hardware; step two is setting up the heartbeat. This can give your system a gentle kick when something you've done screws it up.</li>
<li>Want to install a Python script in your virtualenv as a system service that starts at boot? I've made that <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/sbma44/rpi/blob/master/make_init.py">fairly simple</a>, though the script does bake in a few assumptions about your directory structure.</li>
<li>Optionally, <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/sbma44/rpi/blob/master/postfix.sh">this script</a> will help you set up outbound mail via your Gmail account</li>
<li>Finally, there's <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/sbma44/rpi/blob/master/phantomjs.sh">a script</a> to install an ARM processor-compatible version of <a class="reference external" href="http://phantomjs.org">PhantomJS</a>. More on that in a sec.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some things are best done once, however. For a long time I installed whatever the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads">latest Raspbian image</a> was, then went through the raspi-config script (which launches automatically on the first boot) and then ran my bootstrap script.</p>
<p>This takes forever, though. I got particularly sick of reconfiguring raspi-config to expect a non-UK keyboard.</p>
<p>But creating a new and improved disk image eluded me for a while. Installing all the aforementioned junk requires that you expand the filesystem to use more of the SD card (the default uses only 2GB). But if you use the dd tool to image the result, it'll show the full size of the SD card. And an image of one 4GB SD card (for instance) won't necessarily fit on a different model or brand of 4GB SD card. (You should be using 8+GB cards anyway, to minimize system failures due to repeated writes to the same sector.)</p>
<p>The solution: <a class="reference external" href="http://elinux.org/RPi_Resize_Flash_Partitions">expand the filesystem manually to 3GB or so</a>. Use raspi-config to assert your American independence. Get everything set up. And then record an image using something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
sudo dd if=/dev/disk1 of=preconfigured_raspberry_pi.img bs=1048576 count=3000</blockquote>
<p>This instructs dd to copy from /dev/disk1 in 1 megabyte chunks, and to pull three thousand of them. The remaining five thousand or so (on an 8GB card) can simply be ignored, I think? Honestly, it's a bit difficult to keep track of which levels of filesystem abstraction and definition are included where. Perhaps those missing five thousand megabytes will come back to haunt me someday. But not yet.</p>

<h2>Somehow the Vital Connection is Made</h2>
<p>All of the above gets us a wooden box and a cheap and useful Linux environment. How do we make it actually translate Things On The Internet into a dial moving... somewhere?</p>
<p>Well, first you'll need a wifi adapter. I tend to buy <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0069LOX7K/ref=wms_ohs_product?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">this one</a>, which is tiny, less than ten dollars, compatible with the Raspberry Pi default distro without any additional drivers, and can mostly connect to wifi networks without exceeding the Pi's rather wussy USB power capabilities. But there are other perfectly fine choices out there.</p>
<p>Getting wifi working on Linux is awful under the best of circumstances, but when done without a GUI it easily competes with the most imaginative punishments Greek mythology can offer. Please, please use the /etc/network/interfaces and wpa_supplicant.conf patterns linked above. For me, they're the culmination of more than a year's worth of trial and error across multiple embedded systems (next time you see me, ask to see my <a class="reference external" href="https://connman.net/">FUCK CONNMAN</a> tattoo). Others will have wisely gone straight to LadyAda's <a class="reference external" href="http://learn.adafruit.com/category/learn-raspberry-pi">excellent series of Raspberry Pi lessons</a>, from which this solution is cribbed.</p>
<p>But wifi connectivity is only the beginning.</p>

<h2>A Ghost Is Born</h2>
<p>Fantasy football is one of those strange areas of human endeavor in which Yahoo is successful. It's free and it's what my friends and I use, anyway. And it's comforting to begin to know the annual rhythms: unnecessary redesign, mobile app flakiness, disastrous week 1 server outage, ensuing apology, eventual system stability. I look forward to repeating the cycle next year.</p>
<p>Alas, the API seems basically useless for anything beyond establishing that Yahoo runs a fantasy football service. So we're going to be screen-scraping, navigating and disassembling messy HTML pages in just the same way that your browser does.</p>
<p>This is not a reliable process. Worse still, Yahoo counts on tons of Javascript to render portions of the page after the initial HTML has been delivered. Knowing what is supposed to happen after that point requires a Javascript interpreter, which is a sophisticated piece of machinery beyond most scripting environments. Instead, you have to connect your script to a browser and ask it, intermittently and politely, what the hell is going on right now.</p>
<p>This task used to be so hellaciously finicky that I'd never gotten it to work. But <a class="reference external" href="http://phantomjs.org/">Phantom.js</a> has removed most of those difficulties, and as I mentioned above, there's a compiled version for Raspberry Pi which can simply be copied onto the device and used. I employed the Selenium Webdriver interface, but mostly because of peer pressure. I've been hearing good things about <a class="reference external" href="http://casperjs.org/">Casper.js</a>.</p>
<p>Yahoo ensures that this will not be the end of your woes, but I've encoded a number of hard-fought lessons in <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/sbma44/doughmeter/blob/master/yahoofantasyfootball.py">this Python class</a>, and will probably update it once the 2014 season redesign arrives and breaks everything. (The rest of the code for the meter is <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/sbma44/doughmeter">here</a>, incidentally.)</p>

<div class="section" id="moving-the-needle">
<h2>Moving the Needle</h2>
<p>The last piece of the puzzle: making the damn needles move. Most of the excitement is already recorded in <a class="reference external" href="/2013/03/10/texameter/">this post</a>. But in short: microcontrollers are all-or-nothing beasts, setting output pins to zero volts or ALL THE VOLTS (3.3 in the case of the Pi). But they can approximate intermediate values by turning a pin on and off very rapidly, with the ratio of on:off determining the voltage that's being approximated. This is called pulse width modulation, and the Pi has built-in hardware that allows it to deal with this constant switching without expending any brainpower -- but only on one pin.</p>
<p>Luckily, the wiringpi library has included as sophisticated a system for additional, software-controlled pins as one could hope for, though each additional pin comes at the cost of a bit more CPU utilization. Fortunately we only need two for this meter (the -100 to +100 meter is actually set up to behave as if it's two separate meters).</p>
<p>The vintage gauges themselves are not configured for 3.3v, of course. But that's where trim potentiometers come in:</p>
<p>Those <a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/10102908783/">little blue and white dials</a> labeled 1, 5 and 6 are the trim pots in question. Some trial and error can deliver resistor levels that max out the meter's range without overpowering it. The gauge's response might still not be perfectly linear, but that's where <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/sbma44/pwm_calibrate">this little library comes in</a>.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>Yesterday Tim Lee and Ashkan Soltani reported a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2013/12/18/research-shows-how-macbook-webcams-can-spy-on-their-users-without-warning/">surprising and alarming revelation</a>: some webcams can be activated without their accompanying light being turned on. This means it's conceivable that criminals or government agents could compromise your computer and take surreptitious pictures of you. It's a frightening prospect.</p>
<p>It's also one that I had more or less deemed impossible based on what I know about electrical engineering. I owe Tim and Ashkan my thanks for teaching me something new.</p>
<p>But I think it's worth delving into exactly what makes this attack possible. The paper their story focuses on concerns one particular attack on one particular type of webcam. Left unanswered is whether vulnerabilities like this one are commonplace. Examining how this attack works can provide some reassurance about engineers' good intentions, but leaves plenty of reasons to worry about their insufficiency.</p>
<p>You can find the paper detailing the attack <a class="reference external" href="https://jscholarship.library.jhu.edu/bitstream/handle/1774.2/36569/camera.pdf?sequence=1">here</a> (thanks, guan!).</p>
<p>Before we walk through how the attack works, let's establish our cast of characters -- one that's slightly simplified relative to the specifics of this attack, but which will suffice for our purposes.</p>
<p>First, there's your computer. It looks like a computer, and behaves in a computerlike fashion.</p>
<p>Second, there's the webcam microcontroller. This is also a computer! But it's a much tinier, lousier computer -- one that fits on a single microchip. Still, it can run programs, and it can talk to your computer. And we're not going to ask it to do very much: mostly it's just supposed to manage the other components in the webcam and report their outputs back to the computer when asked.</p>
<p>Third, there's the image sensor. It's digital and electronic, certainly, and it even speaks binary code and executes commands, but it doesn't run arbitrary programs. It does have internal states and settings, though -- it's not a completely passive, memoryless device like a lightbulb or motor.</p>
<p>Here's the key diagram from the paper:</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="/static/2013/12/webcam_vulnerability.png"><img alt="webcam_vulnerability" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2703" src="/static/2013/12/webcam_vulnerability.png" style="width: 349px; height: 428px;" /></a></p>
<p>On the bottom is the microcontroller. On the top is the image sensor. There is a connection between the two of them labeled &quot;standby&quot;. When operating normally, the image sensor will go into standby mode whenever the microcontroller sends a voltage to this connection.</p>
<p>On the right side of the diagram is the LED. Its input side is connected directly to the system's power source (V<sub>cc</sub>), and its output side is connected to the &quot;standby&quot; line. A circuit can only do work when energy flows through it, so when both sides of the LED are set to the same voltage -- when the standby line is &quot;high&quot; -- no current will flow and the LED will remain dark. When the voltage on this connection is low, the image sensor will emerge from standby mode; current will flow from V<sub>cc</sub>, through the LED and out the &quot;standby&quot; line; and light will be generated.</p>
<p>This is a pretty good system! The LED's function is tied directly to something that enables or disables the image sensor. This arrangement can't be undone without cutting wires. Really, that &quot;standby&quot; line looks a lot like a power switch.</p>
<p>But it isn't. The image sensor was designed to be a flexible component that might be used in many different configurations, not just the iSight. This is the norm in electronics, with a few exceptions like the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_A7">custom chips</a> that Apple designs for its iPhones. In this case, the image sensor can be configured in different ways by sending it different setup commands from the microcontroller. One can imagine modes for &quot;low light&quot; or &quot;video&quot; or &quot;grayscale&quot;, but there are also numerous esoteric settings that are only useful to engineers. In the case of this particular image sensor, it's possible to tell it to ignore any signals it sees on its &quot;standby&quot; pin.</p>
<p>This probably sounds pretty outrageous, but it's not hard to imagine configurations in which this capability could be useful. When prototyping a circuit, minimizing the number of features and connections that must be used can make the process faster and simpler. In some applications the image sensor might be on all the time, making a usable &quot;standby&quot; line irrelevant (or, if not properly grounded and shielded, even a source of buggy behavior).</p>
<p>Alternately, it might seem outrageous that the engineer designing the webcam system overlooked this capability in the image sensor. This is a stronger argument. But this is an easy mistake to make.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://download.micron.com/pdf/datasheets/imaging/MT9V112.pdf">Here's the datasheet for the image sensor</a>. At 61 pages it's not especially long (microprocessor datasheets can be thousands of pages), but I think you'll agree that it's not the easiest thing to read. What you probably can't see is that datasheets are often <a class="reference external" href="http://www.analog.com/en/content/raq_caveat/fca.html">riddled with errors</a>. They are usually written by engineers, which produces a terrible product but is better than the alternative. As you might imagine, the result is more or less impervious to editing and verification by humans. Datasheets for very popular or venerable chips can be very good, but for complicated, new or little-used products, they can contain serious problems. Partially for this reason, datasheets often contain information about &quot;reference implementations&quot;: partially or wholly built systems that show how the component is supposed to be used with a minimum of complicating details, and which engineers are implicitly encouraged to follow without question.</p>
<p>None of this excuses the webcam engineer's failure to foresee this security hole. But you can imagine how it happened. Having someone manipulate this completely undocumented hardware system, reprogramming a microcontroller to, in turn, reprogram an image sensor to use a counterintuitive operational mode that (for all I know) might be completely idiosyncratic to this image sensor chip? It's tough to get too angry over someone's decision to spend their time on other problems.</p>
<p>Is this comforting? Sort of. It's an awfully specific vulnerability. It's pretty easy to see how to design around it (use the LED to test for power to the image sensor, not the state of its standby line; harden the microcontroller's programming; the paper's authors discuss a number of possible remedies and the occasional tradeoffs they entail). It's clear that the engineer was <em>trying</em> to tie the LED's activity as closely and irrevocably to the image sensor's operation as he could, which is the right idea. We have no specific reason to think that similar bugs are present in other webcams that use different chips or have more careful authors.</p>
<p>Still. This is a reminder that the systems we use are wildly complex, executing code in many more places than just the CPU. And it's increasingly clear that many of those places have never been scrutinized for vulnerabilities. It's cheering to see security researchers uncover these problems, but criminals and governments have vastly greater resources and incentives to pursue this work, and have had plenty of time to do so. Some masking tape might not be a bad idea.</p>

                    <p>I often find myself defending Sam Biddle's brand of Silicon Valley nihilism to Matt, so I'm sort of surprised to see us switching sides: today <a class="reference external" href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2013/12/09/everyone_should_code_but_reading_is_even_better.html">Matt joins Sam in deriding President Obama's calls to teach schoolkids to program</a>. <a class="reference external" href="http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2013/12/no-everyone-does-not-need-learn-program-computer">He's not alone</a>! I think Matt's specific objection doesn't get us very far -- some students' failure to attain basic skills doesn't really tell us all that much about what should be included in a general curriculum, just as the continued existence of murder doesn't tell us much about the wisdom of enforcing speed limits.</p>
<p>But it is worth spelling out the case for teaching people to code. It's not because we expect them to become programmers. We don't expect every student in English class to write a novel or every student in Trigonometry to wind up manipulating triangles for a living. We certainly don't expect every kid in music or art class to carry those skills beyond the classroom, or even to achieve proficiency within it.</p>
<p>Rather, we teach those skills because they are varyingly enriching and instructive windows onto reality and culture. They help kids navigate the world. In a few cases they'll wind up being of practical value or make for a fulfilling hobby. But mostly they're about building competent and intelligent human beings.</p>
<p>Coding qualifies. I still distinctly remember programming my grandparents' VCR for them -- a cliche of childhood technical affinity, yes. But also an instructive experience! Why was the schedule set with a 24-hour clock scheme? Why were the on-screen fonts the same across different brands of VCR? What the heck was the difference between SP, LP and SLP? The answers involve the nature of modulo arithmetic, the electronic industry supply chain and electrical engineering practices, and some pretty fundamental concepts from information theory. Some of these revealed themselves quickly; others came decades later. Gaining that simple, unimportant technical skill gave me a window into how engineers' minds work and how the constraints imposed by physical reality shape the systems they build.</p>
<p>Without realizing it, the simple daily use of technology imparts lessons about data normalization, computability and signal processing. Stitching these hunches together with a light classroom introduction to the procedural nature of Turing-style computation is not a bad idea. It's also not a trivial idea -- some people think this perspective <a class="reference external" href="http://www.wolframscience.com/">has enough explanatory power to describe the entire universe</a>.</p>
<p>Nor is it of merely intellectual interest (though I'll happily admit that I do find it deeply intellectually rewarding). In the same way that the economic perspective has largely triumphed over other dialectic forms in our culture, our physical environments grow ever more engineered. And engineering grows ever more digital in nature. Understanding how those processes work at a fundamental level is an increasingly necessary precondition to deciphering our deeply unnatural world.</p>
<p>Do you want to be able to quickly use a new product? Or organize a spreadsheet so that it will be useful later on? Do you want to know why your partner missed that SMS, or why the football broadcast looks blocky?

<p>Learning to code &quot;hello world&quot; won't guarantee you those answers any more than it'll guarantee you a job at Facebook. But it isn't a bad place to start.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the Apple TV isn't able to use VPN software. So we need something to handle that operation instead, making the Apple TV think that it's on a perfectly normal network -- albeit one in Sweden.</p>
<p>This had been on my to-do list for a while, but I finally got around to tackling it today. The results are pretty good! Sadly, it appears that <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nhl.com/ice/gclfaq.htm">hockey-crazy Sweden has blackout rules of its own</a> -- presumably the NHL has a distribution deal with some broadcaster there that makes it necessary to confound people like myself who want to pay to watch hockey but don't care to pay for a complete cable TV package. Bah.</p>
<p>But the system is working -- a laptop substituted for the Apple TV is convinced it's sitting in Stockholm, and my Apple TV Netflix experience is substantially different (title availability is wildly altered). And the NBA League Pass stuff looks like it might be working fine (I don't have an account, but will be bugging Matt to try his out shortly).</p>
<p>So I'll go ahead and record what I did here before I forget it. Perhaps before too long I'll switch to a VPN that terminates in a (non-Washington) US city and see if that doesn't solve my problems.</p>

                    <p>I like to make a new Halloween decoration every year. One year it was <a class="reference external" href="http://www.hectorturner.com/halloween/corpse.html">corpsing a skeleton</a>; another year I built a coffin; another time I made some big glowing papier mache spiders.</p>
<p>This year I decided I wanted some skulls. Goat skulls, ideally -- dollar for dollar, I don't think there's a creepier skull out there. Probably it's all the <a class="reference external" href="http://doom.wikia.com/wiki/Final_boss">Doom 2</a> I played as a kid.</p>
<p>I posted an ad on Craigslist appealing to hunters and farmers for help with (ahem) a &quot;theatrical production.&quot; Eight days later I received a response. &quot;Kyle&quot; worked at Crazy K Goat Ranch, and he seemed to have a lot of skulls; we made plans to meet a few days later. I brought along Dave and Kriston to ensure that the encounter's net flow of skulls went in the direction I expected.</p>
<p>It only took a moment to verify that Kyle was probably the K in &quot;Crazy K&quot;. He was certainly a strange guy. He seemed to live with his parents, and I'm not at all sure that the goat farming is a full-time occupation for him. But he was very nice to us, particularly since I happened to be wearing a Capitals t-shirt -- Kyle was, too, and turned out to be a bit of an Alex Ovechkin super-fan.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.skullsunlimited.com/">$20 per skull is a steal</a>, and we concluded our business quickly. Kyle sold me the skulls of a bunch of goats, an alpaca, a llama, and a pig that had (until recently) been giving him trouble. There is apparently some kind of solution he soaks them in to remove the soft tissue -- it's intensely unpleasant, I'm sure.</p>
<p>Anyway: I had some skulls.</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="/static/2013/10/skulls.jpg"><img alt="skulls" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2635" src="/static/2013/10/skulls.jpg" style="width: 612px; height: 612px;" /></a></p>

<p>A good start! But I wanted to do a little more. And hey: <a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/8130970953/in/set-72157631911659225">I've achieved pretty good results with creepy glowing eye sockets before</a>. Let's do some more of that.</p>
<p>The basics are pretty simple. The idea of an <a class="reference external" href="http://www.instructables.com/id/LED-Throwies/">LED throwie</a> is at least seven years old now (can that be right?) but it works as well as ever. Let's pause for a brief interlude about sticking them all over the cube at Astor Place:</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>Well, the gist is the same as always: the LED and the CR2032 battery are a lovely match. The CR2032's 3 volts are enough to light up most LEDs. Better still, its internal resistance will prevent the LED from burning out immediately, even when used without a resistor. You can wedge a CR2032 between an LED's leads and it will light up quite happily for hours! And hey, <a class="reference external" href="http://cr2032.co/environment-article.html">it turns out that these batteries aren't even that terrible for the environment</a>.</p>
<p>You can get all of these components very cheaply on eBay. <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/50-x-LED-3mm-Red-Water-Clear-Ultra-Bright-USA-Seller-Free-Shipping-/221288139799?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&amp;hash=item3385cd0c17">Here are fifty red LEDs for $3</a>; <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/20-CR2032-DL2032-ECR2032-5004LC-3-Volt-Lithium-Button-Cell-Battery-USA-US-Ship-/400433857727?pt=US_Single_Use_Batteries&amp;hash=item5d3bb7c4bf">here are 20 CR2032s for a little more than $4</a>. If you want to get fancy (and I did) <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/Lot-5-Pcs-New-CR2025-CR2032-Battery-Button-Coin-Cell-Holder-Socket-Case-Black-/180907107772?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&amp;hash=item2a1ee765bc">you can get CR2032 holders for about fifty cents a pop</a>.</p>
<p>Wiring the necessary circuit is dead-simple. I have a distinct memory of getting a small light bulb to illuminate from a battery in second grade; it was the first thing they taught us about electricity. This is no more complex, except that you might need to flip the LED around if you get the polarity wrong the first time. So, no need to belabor that. Also: it turns out hot glue guns work well on bone.</p>
<p>But for a few of the more frightening skulls I went a little further and added a circuit that turns the lights on only when the surrounding environment is dark. It's a pretty useful technique for working with analog signals of any kind (I've also used it to trigger a light-sensor to activate a music box upon opening, for instance), so let's go ahead and run through it.</p>
<p>We'll need three things to make this happen. First, <strong>some way of sensing light</strong> -- that much is obvious. Second, <strong>a way to define what our threshold for &quot;dark enough&quot; is</strong>. Third, <strong>a way to compare the two values and switch the LED circuit on</strong>.</p>
<p>Let's start with the last one. I used an LM393 comparator, a common chip that looks like this:</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="/static/2013/10/LM393.jpg"><img alt="LM393" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2640" src="/static/2013/10/LM393.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 450px;" /></a></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_trksid=p2047675.m570.l1313.TR0.TRC0.Xlm393&amp;_nkw=lm393&amp;_sacat=0&amp;_from=R40">It, too, can be found on eBay for pennies per unit</a>.</p>
<p>The LM393 is very simple. It takes a reference voltage. It takes a comparison voltage. If the latter goes above the former, the chip will make an electrical connection between its output pin and ground, potentially completing a circuit and doing useful work.</p>
<p>The LM393 also looks like this:</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="/static/2013/10/comparator.png"><img alt="comparator" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2637" src="/static/2013/10/comparator.png" style="width: 482px; height: 271px;" /></a></p>
<p>That's the schematic from <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/lm393-n.pdf">its data sheet</a>, mapping the chip's 8 pins to their functions. Pins are numbered in counter-clockwise order, starting to the left of the chip's top side, which is marked by a little notch or off-center circle (or, in the above photo, both). As you can see, there are actually two comparators built into the LM393; we're only using one. For our purposes they're electrically distinct, except for a shared ground and supply voltage (V+ in the diagram, though it's more commonly called V<sub>cc</sub>). The LM393 can run off anything from 2 to 36 volts.</p>
<p>So how do we arrange the reference and comparison voltages? It's really simple, actually: we use a <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage_divider">voltage divider</a>. Picture it like this:</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="/static/2013/10/divider1.png"><img alt="divider" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2643" src="/static/2013/10/divider1.png" style="width: 178px; height: 168px;" /></a></p>
<p>V<sub>in</sub> is our supply voltage -- let's say 10 volts. The horizontal triangular thingy at the bottom is ground. R<sub>1</sub> and R<sub>2</sub> are resistors connected to one another. At the top, it's always gonna be 10 volts. At the bottom, it'll always be zero. That's axiomatically true. But what about <em>in between the resistors</em>, at V<sub>out</sub>?</p>
<p>That depends on the values of R<sub>1</sub> and R<sub>2</sub> -- or, really, the ratio between them. If they're both 100 ohms, or 2500 ohms, or 5 million ohms, V<sub>out</sub> will be 5 volts. If R<sub>1</sub> is 25 ohms and R<sub>2</sub> is 75 ohms, V<sub>out</sub> will be 7.5 volts. If you flipped them, it would be 2.5 volts. It's all pretty linear and straightforward (the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage_divider">Wikipedia voltage divider article</a> will walk you through the math, if you'd like). Make sense?</p>
<p>So! Let's set things up. Keep the battery out of the holder until you're done, but pretend it's in there -- now we have a 3 volt V+ and a ground. Connect 'em to the relevant pins on the LM393. Now take two resistors -- doesn't really matter what value, as long as they're the same, but they should be a decently high value to avoid voltage drain -- and connect them in series, bridging V+ and ground BUT, crucially, making a pit-stop in the middle at pin 5 (&quot;non-inverting input B&quot;). That pin will now be getting a reference voltage of 1.5 volts. If the voltage on pin 6 (&quot;inverting input B&quot;) goes above this value, pin 7 will be connected to ground. If not, not.</p>
<p>But what gets connected to pin 6? Well, seems like we need something that changes its value based on light. Easy enough! A photoresistor is just what it sounds like and is, again, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_trksid=p2050601.m570.l1313.TR0.TRC0.Xscrew+terminals&amp;_nkw=photoresistor&amp;_sacat=0&amp;_from=R40">cheap on eBay</a>. They look like this:</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="/static/2013/10/photoresistor.jpg"><img alt="photoresistor" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2646" src="/static/2013/10/photoresistor.jpg" style="width: 720px; height: 571px;" /></a></p>
<p>That squiggle in the middle is made of a material that lowers its resistance as light hits it. Otherwise, this thing behaves just like a regular resistor. That means we can build a voltage divider with it, just like the one we connected to pin 5. What should we use for the other resistor in the voltage divider circuit, though?</p>
<p>We could just use a regular old resistor. But we'd have to be pretty careful about picking it, and it would lock us in to one particular level of darkness as our threshold value. That's not a great idea, particularly since human senses respond to energy changes adaptively and logarithmically, while sensors do not.</p>
<p>It will be much better to use a variable resistor -- a potentiometer. <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/100ohm-1M-Kit-Variable-Resistors-Potentiometer-65pcs-13-value-5pcs-each-Assorted-/221302553462?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&amp;hash=item3386a8fb76">Back to eBay</a>! These guys come in many different forms, but for this we can get away with a the teeny tiny ones that you adjust with a screwdriver (sometimes called <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trimmer_(electronics)">&quot;trim pots&quot; or &quot;trimmers&quot;</a>).</p>
<p>Picking the appropriate range for the potentiometer is important. We want something that will let us flirt with the half-of-V+ comparison voltage we already defined via the divider we built out of those first two resistors. In this case, that means getting out a multimeter and figuring out the range of your photoresistor. Test it in darkness; test it in daylight. Try to find a trim pot that can approximate this range of resistances, or at least one that can be adjusted to somewhere around the photoresistor's value in slightly-too-bright-for-goat-skull-glowing conditions.</p>
<p>Now make a voltage divider with these two -- it'll be the same deal as before, just connected to a different pin. The photoresistor lives on the side of the circuit closer to ground. The trim pot lives on the side closer to V+. The junction between the two goes to pin 6.</p>
<p>Finally, connect the ground side of the LED leads to pin 7. This is the final schematic:</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="/static/2013/10/schematic.jpg"><img alt="schematic" class="aligncenter wp-image-2662" src="/static/2013/10/schematic-1024x803.jpg" style="width: 614px; height: 482px;" /></a></p>
<p>I did all of this in &quot;deadbug&quot; style:</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="/static/2013/10/deadbug.jpg"><img alt="deadbug" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2647" src="/static/2013/10/deadbug.jpg" style="width: 527px; height: 518px;" /></a></p>
<p>Now wait until it's dark in the room and adjust the trim pot until the lights juuuust turn on. Voila!</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="/static/2013/10/10526396545_5ac3a77ed6.jpg"><img alt="10526396545_5ac3a77ed6" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2648" src="/static/2013/10/10526396545_5ac3a77ed6.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: 500px;" /></a></p>
<p>When it's brighter, the circuit should turn off. You'll want to fiddle with the placement of the photoresistor -- I gave mine a little wire lead and ran it out to the edge of the skull. It doesn't need to be in direct light, but obviously it does need to experience <em>some</em> change in lighting conditions, and the bigger those changes are the easier it will be to select and adjust your trim pot.</p>
<p>The batteries will experience some drain even when the LEDs are off, but the LM393 is designed to consume very little juice. The voltage dividers take a little bit of power, but hopefully you picked elements with adequately large resistive values. If your in-light resistor networks both amount to 10K ohms apiece, your total system will consume about 1 milliamp at rest. Not bad! At that load, a fresh CR2032 should last for about 200 hours (less if the LEDs are activated, of course).</p>
<p>The LM393 makes for a fun little project -- a nice way to build a night-light, or clean up an input signal to an Arduino, or just have something to mess around with on a breadboard. If you flip the two input pins, it'll become a light detector rather than a darkness detector. It's useful for almost any variable-voltage measurement of the analog world. I originally bought these components for a project designed to use a <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermistor">thermistor</a> to tell me when a cup of coffee was a pleasant temperature for drinking.</p>
<p>So, somewhat far afield from skulls. But the nice thing about this application is that there's really no precedent for anyone getting upset about mixing electricity and illicitly-obtained body parts.</p>

                    <p>Well, that was great. It's been a few years since I'd been able to throw a proper Halloween party -- the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/sets/72157602811270206/">Fickeweens of yore</a> formed the start of a proud tradition, but without a venue my various skeletons', giant spiders' and fog machines' annual appearance was relegated to a fun-but-sadly-professional office open house.</p>
<p>But Annie and Ezra bought a new place this year and heroically stepped in to fill the void. And we had a great time! <a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/sets/72157637026752364/">I put a bunch of the pictures here</a>; the best are probably <a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=stolenstagrams+halloween13&amp;m=tags&amp;ss=0&amp;ct=0&amp;mt=all&amp;w=44137303%40N00&amp;adv=1">the ones I collected from Instagram</a>.

<p>In a departure from my streak of dressing up as supervillains with romantic problems (which, to be fair, is most of them), I went as Mr. Fantastic. I wanted to concentrate on the party, and this was relatively easy to pull off -- just (yet another set of) Under Armour and a layer of white duct tape on top of part of my <a class="reference external" href="/2011/10/30/this-years-model/">Omni-Man costume</a>.</p>
<p>People did get a kick out of the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/10524624665/">electroluminescent panel I used for the logo on my chest</a>, though. Like everything else that is good in this world, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/EL-Lamp-electroluminescent-panel-backlight-led-alternative-A5-White-/231066989058?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&amp;hash=item35ccaa7202">you can buy this material from Chinese vendors on eBay</a> -- it comes in various sizes and colors. Attached to an inverter -- which requires a meager 2 AA batteries -- it'll change from a pink to a cool white glow. Pretty neat! You can cut the material down, too, but bear in mind the delicate nature of the foil that makes the electrical connections. Adhesives and solder won't work -- you're going to need to clamp your connections. I found that paper binder clips did a good job. Conductive paint or glue might work, but I didn't have any on hand.</p>
<p>An even more important Halloween costume innovation: the duct tape smartphone pocket. Man, what a quality of life improvement. Highly recommended! Add a little <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Velcro-Brand-Industrial-Strength-Inches/dp/B00006IC2T/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1382921427&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=adhesive+velcro">adhesive velcro</a> if you really want to class things up.</p>
<p>I made one for myself and one for Steph, too -- she put together a great version of Debrie-from-Arrested-Development-as-Sue-Storm, making for what I think was <a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/10523222743/">a quite successful (if slightly textually complicated) couples costume</a>.</p>
<p>Anyway! More on this year's specific decorative efforts in a separate post. For now: many thanks to everyone who came out; to Annie and Ezra for opening their house to this stupid hobby of mine (and buying everyone beer!); and to Steph for putting up with my weird obsessiveness these past few weeks.</p>

I should perhaps confess that on September 11 last, once I had experienced all the usual mammalian gamut of emotions, from rage to nausea, I also discovered that another sensation was contending for mastery. On examination, and to my own surprise and pleasure, it turned out be exhilaration. Here was the most frightful enemy–theocratic barbarism–in plain view... I realized that if the battle went on until the last day of my life, I would never get bored in prosecuting it to the utmost.</blockquote>
<p>Christopher Hitchens made <a class="reference external" href="http://www.thenation.com/article/images-rearview-mirror">that ugly little confession</a>. Today, safely on the other side of the government's two week shutdown, I'm feeling a similar shame.</p>
<p>The embarrassing truth is that for those who work in and around politics, the shutdown was great. It was something to gossip about, write about, get indignant about. It was exciting! And it was good for business.</p>
<p>For the press, acknowledging this is easy enough: that discipline has had a lot of practice at explaining its responsibility to document travesties without averting them. <a class="reference external" href="http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2013/10/where-did-robert-costa-come-from.html?mid=twitter_nymag">Here's Robert Costa making the transition from &quot;guy who works with Jonah Goldberg&quot; to &quot;conservative press corp dean / less creepy reincarnation of Bob Novak.&quot;</a> He's far from the only writer lamenting-the-shutdown-but-not-really:</p>

<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p><p>The effect exists outside of the media. The shutdown was good to those of us who occuppy ourselves watchdogging the government. Here's my friend Josh Tauberer, who runs <a class="reference external" href="http://govtrack.us">GovTrack.us</a>:</p>

<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p><p>I can sympathize. Sunlight's blog saw a modest 10% boost in traffic during the shutdown relative to the two weeks preceding it. But our <a class="reference external" href="congress.sunlightfoundation.com">iOS and Android mobile apps</a>, which provide information about Congress, saw usage spikes of 186% and 195%, respectively. We don't sell ads, but our funders care about those numbers. And I've probably fielded more press calls in the last two weeks than the preceding six months (admittedly, many of these have been about healthcare.gov's failures, not Congress's, but I think that's still in the neighborhood of profiting from human misery).</p>
<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, the people most responsible for the shutdown have benefited from its effects, too. We're still tallying <a class="reference external" href="http://realtime.influenceexplorer.com/newest-filings/">the latest quarterly numbers</a>, but <a class="reference external" href="http://thinkprogress.org/default/2013/10/16/2791091/ted-cruz-admits-budget-standoff-fundraising/">anecdotal reports indicate that the crisis helped people like Ted Cruz raise a lot of money</a>. <a class="reference external" href="http://www.publicintegrity.org/2013/10/15/13549/political-fundraising-boosted-shutdown-default">Fundraising emails from both parties latched onto the shutdown as a moneymaker right from the start</a>.</p>
<p>I spent the final days of the shutdown at a conference in San Francisco, where I gossipped with a fellow traveler about a shared acquaintance's new-ish cable news show, and how a shutdown-prompted ratings boost had taken it safely off the bubble. And Twitter analytics tell me that I went from an average of 12.7 tweets per day to a manic 17.8 during the shutdown! Oh, the fun that I had!</p>
<p>This wasn't true for many people who depend on a federal paycheck. Although my girlfriend was glad enough to have a nasty deadline moved by the shutdown, when I callously referred to &quot;workers being paid for sitting around doing nothing&quot; on an internal office listserv, I invited several deservedly angry replies from the spouses of feds. My friend Dave is a Capitol Hill staffer; for him this episode has meant incredibly-longer-than-usual work days and the possibility of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/newsdesk/2013/10/why-congressional-staffers-hate-the-vitter-amendement.html">a nonsensical pay cut</a> (<a class="reference external" href="http://sunlightfoundation.com/policy/documents/keeping_congress_competent/">staffers are already badly underpaid</a>).</p>
<p>And this is to say nothing of the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/10/07/this-cancer-patients-treatment-is-on-hold-because-of-the-government-shutdown/">cancer patients who had to delay treatment</a>, or <a class="reference external" href="http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/politics/57003062-90/state-utah-million-national.html.csp">the people on SNAP and WIC who faced the very real prospect of going hungry</a> because of Washington's preening.</p>
<p>It's not that I think we should be ashamed, exactly. I'm genuinely proud of the work that I and my colleagues did during the shutdown. People wanted the information we provided. We think it's important, and we'd have been fools not to respond to a sudden surge of public interest in the mission we pursue every day. I think that every non-legislator mentioned above should be proud of the work they did, too. I was disgusted by this crisis, and I said so, but I couldn't stop it--none of us could.</p>
<p>But it's worth owning up to the fact that the incentives within the D.C. media-nonprofit-industrial complex are terrible. <a class="reference external" href="http://business.time.com/2013/10/16/sp-says-government-shutdown-cost-economy-24-billion/">S&amp;P says this escapade wasted $24 billion</a>. We have to stop doing this. Removing these processes from the realm of human theatrics, gossip and competition will be a necessary component of that change. Mostly, that means getting rid of the debt ceiling and electing better legislators. But part of it might also be about having less fun.</p>

                    <p><a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/konklone/status/367787595427622912">Eric asked me what I think of the Tessel</a>! Well, sort of. Anyway I find myself delighted to have semi-informed thoughts about hobbyist microcontroller-y solutions. It's a pleasant byproduct of all the time I've spent on silly electronics projects over the last decade, and makes me feel better about my own perpetually-dawning software senescence.</p>
<p>But so: the Tessel. Will it succeed? Is it worthwhile? You can read about it <a class="reference external" href="http://technical.io/">here</a> but the important details are that it's got wifi and a bunch of <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Purpose_Input/Output">GPIOs</a> and its development environment is built around Javascript -- so much so that it can allegedly run many many node.js packages!</p>
<p>That's all potentially interesting, but its odds of success can't be understood outside of the environment it enters. So let's talk about the two gorillas in the hobbyist space: Arduino and Raspberry Pi.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> is a really cheap Linux computer with 256 MB of RAM. Like, $25 cheap. No onboard wifi -- it'll cost you another $10 to add ethernet (and double the RAM), or about the same for a USB wifi adapter. But it's a pretty capable little system! There are some GPIOs, but not that many, and they're not that robust, and there's only one hardware PWM output, which is annoying if you know what that means. It's also not open source. Still, it's a genuine Linux system, which makes it able to harness an&nbsp;<em>immensely</em> powerful library of software. And its makers&nbsp;seem to have a sweetheart deal with Broadcom that enables their price point.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://arduino.cc/">Arduino</a> is a friendly microcontroller environment, and I should probably explain what that means. A microcontroller (uC) is a little computer -- so little that it suffers really serious limitations. For instance, it'll usually have less than 1MB of memory, and it'll run thousands of times slower than your laptop CPU, and it'll only be able to manipulate integers and have no video output or keyboard input. Pretty sad! On the other hand, it only costs a couple of bucks. And this list of capabilities isn't too dissimilar to, say, the videogame systems you had growing up (if you're as venerable as me, anyway).</p>
<p>The cheapness of uCs mean they can be singleminded. Your computer is doing a ton of things all the time. Its most fundamental pieces of software decide how to split up processor time between those things, like a library of fantastically complicated clockwork systems that need to be cranked forward, one at a time, by one very spritely curator. The curator has pretty good instincts about how to manage her charges, but sometimes she remembers it's time to rebuild your search index or sync your system clock or check for Chrome updates or whatever, which means everything else might not get her attention right when you expected it would.</p>
<p>This is mostly fine, but it doesn't work very well when you need extremely precise timing. Everything is&nbsp;<em>so fast</em>&nbsp;that it's mostly still pretty precise (and you can pursue some <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTLinux">ridiculous hacks</a> to make it more precise still). But when you're dealing with the real world, or finicky electrical systems, the need for very precise timing comes up more often than you'd think.</p>
<p>Microcontrollers are pretty good for this kind of thing. They can just sit there running one program because they're so cheap. The curator's attention is undivided; her behavior is predictable.</p>
<p>Arduino isn't actually a chip, it's a development and deployment environment wrapped around a particular family of chips made by Atmel. It makes it a&nbsp;<em>hell</em> of a lot easier to write code for those chips. Even that comes at a cost. My <a class="reference external" href="/2012/01/02/ok-this-is-the-last-led-christmas-lights-video/">dumb Christmas lights</a> require communication in 10 microsecond pulses (rather pokey as these things go). But if you look at the &quot;Timing&quot; section of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/279657/Simulating-and-controlling-GE-Color-Effects-Lights">this post you'll</a> see that to fake a 10-ish microsecond delay on Arduino you need to tell it to delayMicroseconds(3) or delayMicroseconds(4) depending on the Atmel chip. The Arduino environment introduces overhead -- it's a bit finicky. Still! The Arduino is&nbsp;<em>much</em>&nbsp;better about this stuff than the Raspberry Pi.</p>
<p>(In the real world, sophisticated processors deal with applications that require precise timing requirements by speaking to microcontroller-like chips that handle their responsibilities precisely, but which can also speak to the main processor in a relatively timing-insensitive manner. Your sound card -- or, more likely, the part of your processor that used to be a distinct component called a sound card -- is a good example. Some of my current projects use a Raspberry Pi to speak to an Arduino to speak to an <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ti.com/product/tlc5940">LED controller chip</a>, which is less silly than it probably sounds.)</p>
<p>So! Enough preamble. Where does the Tessel lie on this continuum?</p>
<p>I think it's almost certainly going to be more Pi-like than Arduino-like. The fact that it's Javascript-focused is notable (though it's also worth noting that <a class="reference external" href="http://beagleboard.org/Support/BoneScript">the BeagleBone -- a Raspberry Pi precursor -- also pushes a JS-first approach</a>). It's a testament to the shockingly widespread impact of the V8 engine on our technical culture -- one of the many genuinely unselfish things that Google has given to the world. &nbsp;We'll have to remember this when they're forcibly uploading our brains a few years from now.</p>
<p>Could the Tessel run a Javascript environment in some incredibly constrained manner that allows for precise, uC-like timing? Eh. Maybe? It seems pretty unlikely to me, particularly given all the general-purpose node.js packages that it claims to support. If you want a high level of precision, you need to know about and account for everything the system is doing. That means you can't work at a particularly high level of abstraction, as the Arduino example above hopefully demonstrates. You probably need to write assembly or C, not an interpreted language like JS that passes through a black box of voodoo optimizations. This is particularly true for an environment like node.js that emphasizes asynchronous approaches with somewhat unpredictable timing (says the guy who's never written any node.js code).&nbsp;And even if that sort of thing were easy to do in node, all those package authors would not have done it, since the Tessel didn't exist when they did their work.</p>
<p>It seems most likely that the Tessel will be a stripped down *nix environment (the Tessel's processor is a cheaper installment from the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ti.com/product/am3358">same ARM family that powers the BeagleBone</a>). But it'll only have 32 MB of RAM! You can run a <a class="reference external" href="https://openwrt.org/">tiny OS</a> in that -- <a class="reference external" href="/2008/03/26/dorkbot-dc-arduino-meet-fonera/">I've done it plenty</a>. But it's going to suck in various ways. And I'm not really convinced it's going to be cheaper than the much more capable $25 Raspberry Pi.</p>
<p>The Arduino, meanwhile, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.radioshack.com/product/index.jsp?productId=12268262">is waiting at your neighborhood Radioshack for $30</a>, and&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_odkw=arduino&amp;_osacat=0&amp;_from=R40&amp;_trksid=p2045573.m570.l1313.TR10.TRC2.A0.Xiduino&amp;_nkw=iduino&amp;_sacat=0">Chinese clones can be easily had for $7</a> or <a class="reference external" href="http://www.instructables.com/id/The-RRRRRRRRRRBA-or-What-They-Dont-Teach-You-in-/">less</a>.</p>
<p>The Tessel, I think, aims to land between Arduino and the Pi. And that's not crazy. Making this stuff more accessible is really worthwhile! Building a lovely little network-capable platform with handy modular sensors and helper libraries is worthwhile! Getting an Arduino online is terrible and expensive, and the Raspberry Pi's universe of <a class="reference external" href="http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoShields">shields</a> is still a bit underwhelming. There is good work yet to be done.</p>
<p>But both of those projects are hugely popular. You shouldn't underestimate how important those network effects are. I spent a ton of time on BeagleBone, then gave up. Other than price, it is a much better platform than Raspberry Pi: it's fully open, has more GPIOs and a better processor. But people got&nbsp;<em>so excited</em> about the Pi, thanks in large part to the enormous publicity it attracted. Seemingly overnight I could pick from&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://learn.adafruit.com/category/learn-raspberry-pi">a million awesome tutorials penned by brilliant people eager to figure stuff out for me</a>. Same goes for Arduino.</p>
<p>Could Tessel carve out a new niche? Sure. I think it'd have to offer something new, though, and I'm not sure it does. The Tessel looks nice, but it's probably not going to be cheap enough or offer enough additional utility over established platforms to become a huge success. You can run node.js on a Pi, after all.</p>

                    <p>Calvino books are Calvino books. They're rewarding if approached in the right mindset. What distinguishes them is simply their framing, and this wasn't my favorite. Drained of verbs, these descriptions of cities reflect thinking that is often profound, though also sometimes banal (yes, suburbs often seem alike). There's a few too many setups involving superficial duality and an ensuing revelation of redemptive humanist imperfection.</p>
<p>So: pretty good. Cosmicomics and Mr. Palomar remain my favorites, though.</p>

                    <p>Eh. It's clever, writing a book like this one as a follow-up to his own debut. Diving headlong into mystic Christian conspiracy theories, Eco cleverly parodies himself while leveling a broader critique against the human temptation toward gnosis and syncretism. The action surrounding our main characters is also pretty fun.</p>
<p>But the damn thing's just way too long. Eco tells us over and over again that these imagined connections are meaningless, which makes it difficult to wade through hundreds of pages of historical arcana. By the end, exhaustion had distracted me from his characters' stories and struggles. A decent editor could have made this great. As it stands, Eco can't resist the temptation to show off, whether through his own (always modestly disclaimed!) flights of historical fancy, or with inserted experimental fiction that left me cold.</p>
<p>As a sidenote: it was legitimately fascinating to see so much occultism cleanly laid out. I found myself wondering if Mike Mignola used this as a blueprint for his Hellboy universe or if the grail conspiracies are just well-established. But it's all there: the Templars, Ultimate Thule, Aggartha and on and on...</p>

                    <p>Carlos Ruiz Zafon is a talented writer and a miraculous self-promoter. <em>The Angel's Game</em> -- like <em>The Shadow of the Wind</em> -- will leave you convinced that you've read a better book than you have. But that doesn't mean you shouldn't read it.</p>
<p>In the case of TAG, the approach is fairly straightforward. Ruiz Zafon reverentially invokes the institution of Literature in all its forms, from a refuge for the young; to the pretentious journalistic elevation of copyediting into a sacred crusade; to the fucking smell of books; to the invocation of Dickens to canonize the institution of the blood- and melodrama-soaked potboiler.</p>
<p>This is all fine so far as it goes. Its real purpose is to telegraph what's about to come -- to create a theology of letters in which pulp holds a place of esteem no less dignified than nominally loftier stuff. Ruiz Zafon is going to give us pulp. He wants us to understand it to be exalted pulp.</p>
<p>I think this perspective is basically right. It reminds me of Michael Chabon's essays insisting that literature can include acts of imagination, excitement, adventure and the fantastic. As I steel myself for this year's Man Booker long list, it's good to be reminded that &quot;good&quot; books don't necessarily have to be about terminal illness and divorce.</p>
<p>Still, I do think that this framing is at least a little self-serving. Which is fine: Ruiz Zafon delivers a real page-turner, and ably adorns it with literary allusions and devices (albeit occasionally heavy-handed ones). The book has some problems with pacing, and the emotional pallette favors breadth over depth. But it's pretty great entertainment, ably weaving together thrills, supernatural horror, sexual tension, tragic romance, satire, noir and light comedy.</p>
<p>But I do worry that I will remember that this book is good more than I'll remember what the book is about. That's certainly the case with <em>The Shadow of the Wind</em> -- I remember where I read it, I and I remember liking it, but I remember terribly little of the book itself, which is pretty unusual for me. Perhaps TAG will fare better.</p>

                    <p>Pretty brutal. I'm ashamed to admit this is the first Roth I've read -- my mom sent this to me -- but based on his reputation and my sense of the book, it's hard for me to imagine this is among his best.</p>
<p>The problem is really just length. Roth wants to throw together some research about summer camp and polio and musings about theodicy. The polio asserts itself through the decimation of various basically interchangeable children surrounding the protagonist, who's a youth educator. But he's a flat and boringly noble character, devoid of psychology aside from overdeveloped senses of duty and guilt. These ensure that polio will destroy him utterly, even after the crisis of the epidemic has passed. And that could could be interesting.</p>
<p>But instead of that tragic flaw's artful revelation, the dynamics of it are dumped on us by the narrator in the book's last ten pages. It feels rushed and unnecessary. Those ten pages are solid, and include this gut-punch about bitterness:</p>
<p>&quot;I'll never be me as I was me in the past. I'll be this instead for the rest of my life. I'll never know delight again.&quot;</p>
<p>Oof. Preach. Anyway it's more of a sermon than anything else.</p>
<p>Still, great prose and a quick read. It's really just a novella, though. Could easily have been a proper novel but you get the feeling the author's heart wasn't in it.</p>

                    <p>Though not totally meritless, it's safe to say this was not a favorite of mine. I had two primary objections.</p>
<p>First, Becks got it about right when she said &quot;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/616331308">I've never read a book that got technology as wrong as this</a>.&quot; Much of the technobabble reads like <a class="reference external" href="http://www.theonion.com/articles/fasttalking-computer-hacker-just-has-to-break-thro,32000/">this Onion article</a>. It's gibberish -- nonsense that's clearly been passed by a technologist for vocabulary-correction, but which is conceptually empty. I can usually forgive this (though after been recently treated to the very high technical standards of Cory Doctorow's work, I'm less inclined to do so that I used to be). But in this case the nonsense is used both to define the various maguffins that drives much of the story and to provide the too-tidy resolution that our protagonist drops in the climax. And where the hell did Wilson get the idea that overloaded computers can <em>melt</em>? It's completely laughable.</p>
<p>Second, I was pretty uncomfortable with the book's politics. I have complaints about the facile approach to political unrest -- the restoration of mobile broadband is treated as if it's the same thing as a popular uprising's successful conclusion. But these are superficial compared to my discomfort with Wilson's sympathy for Islamist counterpoints to the repressive secular state that employs the book's villains. I'm very ready to admit the beauty, wisdom and historical richness of muslims' faith. I'm less prepared to accept Wilson's glib assumption of compatibility between her readership's liberal cosmopolitan values and her religion's ethics and politics. Of <em>course</em> the imam wouldn't <em>really</em> object to popular music. Of <em>course</em> our plucky female lead wears her veil out of choice. I'm sure it's right that this culture is misunderstood and often subjected to ignorant racism. But that doesn't mean its attitudes toward women and personal liberty aren't genuinely noxious. Wilson doesn't ignore this completely, but she's much too ready to retreat into mysticism when it comes up.</p>
<p>I understand Wilson to be a convert to Islam herself (married to an Egyptian man) so I don't want to accuse her of cultural ignorance, or to underestimate the difficulty of reconciling her identity and values with the religious culture she's chosen. I'm sure that's been a difficult and very personal process, and one that I have no right to criticise. But, speaking purely as an outside observer, the philosophical gymnastics that seem to be required don't survive the translation to the page. Frankly, she's got some nerve to snipe at western fiction for its substantive bankruptcy. Her work ignores those depths.</p>
<p>OK. Enough of that. What's good about this book? Well, Wilson's a comic book writer (I suspect this explains a bunch of the silly GR Stephenson comparisons that Becks notes). She has a talent for keeping the action moving and for letting her imagination stretch to interesting locales, characters, scales. They don't always feel fully sketched-out -- perhaps she's used to collaborating with an artist on that? -- but she does often succeed. I particularly enjoyed the inclusion of the djinn, even if the narrative bridge constructed to them -- the Alf Yeom -- didn't really make much sense.</p>
<p>Still, I don't think the book succeeds. The scaffolding's there (though it's at least one act too long), but the foundation's incoherent. Not recommended.</p>

<p>In Ersilia, to establish the relationships that sustain the city's life, the inhabitants stretch strings from the corners of the houses, white or black or gray of black-and-white according to whether they mark a relationship of blood, of trade, authority, agency. When the strings become so numerous that you can no longer pass among them, the inhabitants leave: the houses are dismantled; only the strings and their supports remain.</p>
<p>From a mountainside, camping within their household goods, Ersilia refugees look at the labyrinth of taut strings and poles that rise in the plain. That is the city of Ersilia still, and they are nothing.</p>
<p>They rebuild Ersilia elsewhere. They weave a similar pattern of strings which they would like to be more complex and at the same time more regular than the other. Then they abandon it and take themselves and their houses still farther away.</p>
<p>Then, when traveling in the territory of Ersilia, you come upon the ruins of the abandoned cities, without the walls which do not last, without the bones of the dead which the wind rolls away: spiderwebs of intricate relationships seeking a form.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>I mostly like my Sonos system. The downsides: I had a controller die on me out of warranty; it's a bit pricey; and it doesn't have Airplay support. This last one, at least, turns out to be fixable, thanks to a few open source projects and the Raspberry Pi.</p>
<p>The ingredients:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/abrasive/shairport">Shairport project</a>, for providing Airplay</li>
<li>the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/SoCo/SoCo">SoCo</a> project, for controlling the Sonos</li>
</ul>
<p>This last one is important for making the Sonos start listening to its line-in when Airplay begins to be used.</p>
<p>Getting your Raspberry Pi on your wifi network is a bit of a pain. You'll need to compile Shairport's dependencies and install some modules from CPAN. SoCo's setup.py doesn't leave you with a working installation, but the codebase is fine if you use it directly.</p>
<p>With all the pieces in place, you just need a script like this to switch the Sonos:</p>
<p><code><div class="line-block">
<div class="line">import re, sys</div>
<div class="line">from soco import SonosDiscovery, SoCo</div>
</div>
</p><div class="line-block">
<div class="line">def main():</div>
<div class="line">sd = SonosDiscovery()</div>
<div class="line">possible_matches = sd.get_speaker_ips()</div>
<div class="line">speaker_info = {}</div>
<div class="line">for ip in possible_matches:</div>
<div class="line">s = SoCo(ip)</div>
<div class="line">try:</div>
<div class="line">speaker_info[ip] = s.get_speaker_info()</div>
<div class="line">except Exception, e:</div>
<div class="line">speaker_info[ip] = {}</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">for (ip, speaker) in speaker_info.items():</div>
<div class="line">if re.search(sys.argv[1], speaker.get('zone_name', ''), re.I) is not None:</div>
<div class="line">s = SoCo(ip)</div>
<div class="line">s.switch_to_line_in()</div>
<div class="line">s.play()</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">if __name__ == '__main__':</div>
<div class="line">main()</div>
</div>
<p>and then to start the Shairport daemon like so:</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">perl <span class="pre">/home/pi/sonos-airplay/shairport.pl</span> <span class="pre">-d</span> <span class="pre">-w</span> <span class="pre">/home/pi/sonos-airplay/shairport.pid</span> <span class="pre">-l</span> 100 <span class="pre">--apname=&quot;Sonos&quot;</span> <span class="pre">--play_prog=&quot;/home/pi/.virtualenvs/sonos/bin/python</span> <span class="pre">/home/pi/sonos-airplay/set_line_in.py</span> bedroom&quot;</tt></p>
<p>This will call the <em>set_line_in.py</em> script every time a new Airplay client connects.</p>
<p>For good measure, here's the /etc/init.d/shairport startup file I'm using:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">#!/bin/sh</span></tt></div>
<div class="line"><tt class="docutils literal"># /etc/init.d/shairport</tt></div>
<div class="line"><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">PIUSER='pi'</span></tt></div>
<div class="line"><tt class="docutils literal">case &quot;$1&quot; in</tt></div>
<div class="line"><tt class="docutils literal">start)</tt></div>
<div class="line"><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/home/pi/sonos-airplay/start_shairport.sh</span></tt></div>
<div class="line"><tt class="docutils literal">echo &quot;Starting Shairport Server for $PIUSER &quot;</tt></div>
<div class="line"><tt class="docutils literal">;;</tt></div>
<div class="line"><tt class="docutils literal">stop)</tt></div>
<div class="line"><tt class="docutils literal">kill `cat <span class="pre">/home/pi/sonos-airplay/shairport.pid`</span></tt></div>
<div class="line"><tt class="docutils literal">echo &quot;Shairport Server stopped&quot;</tt></div>
<div class="line"><tt class="docutils literal">;;</tt></div>
<div class="line"><tt class="docutils literal">*)</tt></div>
<div class="line"><tt class="docutils literal">echo &quot;Usage: /etc/init.d/shairport {start|stop}&quot;</tt></div>
<div class="line"><tt class="docutils literal">exit 1</tt></div>
<div class="line"><tt class="docutils literal">;;</tt></div>
<div class="line"><tt class="docutils literal">esac</tt></div>
<div class="line"><tt class="docutils literal">exit 0</tt></div>
</div>
<p>It all works pretty well! The only real downside is the volume: Airplay's pretty quiet. I should be able to automate the volume adjustment on the Sonos -- SoCo exposes that functionality as well, and Shairport can call scripts upon client disconnect, too, to reset the volume. But I haven't had a chance to write that yet.</p>
<p>Anyway, if folks start wandering in from Google and find this useful or desirable, let me know. I could probably make this all a bit more reusable without a ton of trouble (distributing a Raspberry Pi filesystem image might be the easiest thing, really).</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Hmm. Subsequent investigation of the Sonos's line-in level adjustment capabilities reveals that the SoCo portion of this might be unnecessary: there is indeed some capacity for adjusting amplification on the line-in. Better still, there's some sort of line-in activity detection! I think I might stick with my script anyway: I have a Sonos unit on the porch that's usually powered off; I'll probably just adjust the script's logic to pipe the line-in to it if it's activated. Still, for most users the Shairport stuff should be sufficient.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>I mean, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/pie-charts-are-the-worst-2013-6">yikes</a>.</p>
<p>So look. I'm obviously no designer. And I agree that the pie charts in that blog post, which are clearly cherry-picked for maximum terribleness, are terrible.</p>
<p>But usually pie charts are fine. I'm not going to bother collecting examples that demonstrate this, because unless you've led an unusually brief or interesting life, you've seen thousands of them and understood them perfectly well.</p>
<p>But I realize this isn't going to stop you. You have been to the Seminars. You have received the Texts. You have studied the words of the Prophet Tufte, and you have concluded that they demand jihad. I'm not going to convince you otherwise.</p>
<p>I'll make my case anyway.</p>
<p>To me, pie charts are handy for conveying information about the relative components of a whole because they do so through visual cues of both area and angle. If you need to show the relative sizes of multiple wholes, you can do that by varying the pies' size! Fun times, but I suppose it's not for everyone.</p>
<p>But I would like to request that you not join the pie-haters I sometimes see advocating for <a class="reference external" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=donut+graphs&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=27C_UdPXB9Ku4AOz04GIAw&amp;ved=0CAkQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=708">donut graphs</a> or <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treemapping">treemaps</a> as alternatives. These have all of the problems of pie charts, but they throw away one of the two visual cues. (Treemaps can be useful for expressing hierarchies, and donut graphs are useful for... er. Well. Sometimes you can put a number in the middle of them!)</p>
<p>If your graph is confusing, it's probably a bad graph and you should try to make a different one. But let's not pretend that there's a Platonic Graph that we're working toward just because some dweeb in an eye-tracking lab eked out a few milliseconds' worth of statistical significance. Real graphs used for Science usually look like <a class="reference external" href="http://i2.wp.com/themonkeycage.org/static/2013/04/tweet1.png?resize=512%2C353">this</a> (to be honest, even that red line is a bit decadent). It's not great, but it gets the job done. Science is pretty much going fine despite a lot of shitty-looking graphs.</p>
<p>If you ask me (you haven't) presenting information is about tradeoffs. I don't really want to spend all day looking at things that are ugly, and that's okay. Nicely designed graphs are pleasant! People like to look at them, which is important if you want people to look at your graphs. Even if you really think pies are inefficient, you're kidding yourself if you think graphs are always purely made to shoot numerical truth into your readers' brains (when was the last time you adjusted the stroke weight on an error bar?).</p>
<p>People have varying tastes. That's a totally legitimate rationale for hating pie charts. And they're not the best choice for everything. I'm on board with that, too.</p>
<p>(Building part of your self-conception around the fanatical endorsement of the work of the one widely-known name in information design is, I would suggest, a little sillier. But whatever floats your boat. I went through a big anime phase in college, for instance.)</p>
<p>Anyway: pie charts. All I really ask is that you please shut up about them.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>My <a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/5748853361/in/photostream/">last</a> laser-cut finger-joint project (and the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/5726518448/in/photostream/">electronics inside</a>) was meant to be a time machine, an emergency device, a way to bend reality. Also, it was octagonal. These aims proved to be unrealistic. I did pull off the octagonal bit, but even that was a struggle.</p>
<p>Less fraught projects need enclosures, too, though, and I liked the technique. You can do some <a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/8002432003/">super-cool stuff</a> with lasercut materials. Like 3D printing, it removes craftsmanship as an excuse for failing to instantiate the things you imagine.</p>
<p>But although laser-cut construction allows for much stronger and prettier <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ponoko.com/make-and-sell/materials">materials</a> than 3D printing, the process of translating from two dimensions to three is trickier than you might think. There are <a class="reference external" href="http://blog.ponoko.com/2008/11/03/how-to-create-better-nodes/">various considerations</a>, from the variance of the width of the source material to the width of the path burned away by the laser (&quot;kerf&quot;). Accounting for these things in vector graphics editing programs can be quite tedious. It's easy to make mistakes.</p>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="http://capolight.wordpress.com/2011/01/22/drawing-gears-in-sketchup/">right way</a> to do this would probably be to write a plugin for Inkscape/Illustrator. But I'm more comfortable writing Python, so that's what I did. I wrote up a support class that facilitates the creation of <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finger_joint">finger-joints</a>, and which handles things like kerf automatically.</p>
<p>The output isn't designed to be ready-to-print. You should plan to import it to a vector editor and do subsequent work. Here, for example, is the output of a simple script I used for my latest project:</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/8902584803/"><img alt="fingerjoint.py output" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3690/8902584803_cae5f34b72.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: 355px;" /></a></p>
<p>And here's the EPS I constructed from it and submitted to <a class="reference external" href="http://ponoko.com">Ponoko</a>:</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/8902584869/"><img alt="fingerjoint.py output edited" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7391/8902584869_c0a202eb74.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: 332px;" /></a></p>
<p>Note the difference in the corners of the larger piece, in particular. Some editing is necessary. But the results are quite nice!</p>

<p>(ignore those laser scorch marks; I haven't pulled the adhesive paper side off yet, but when I do and flip the sides, the outside should be relatively pristine)</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/sbma44/fingerjoint">I've published the code</a>, and would love to see it expanded into a more general-purpose toolkit.

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>As I began this book, I was disappointed. I had picked it up after reading <a class="reference external" href="/2013/05/04/book-review-the-idea-factory/">The Idea Factory</a>, the fascinating history of Bell Labs: <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Fortunes-Formula-Scientific-Betting-Casinos/dp/0809045990/ref=sr_sp-atf_title_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1369066573&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=fortune%27s+formula">Fortune's Formula</a> was mentioned glowingly in the acknowledgements. Bell Labs employees -- including my favorite, Claude Shannon -- taking a road trip to Vegas to use their reality-bending powers of analysis to defeat the casinos? Sign me up.</p>
<p>Digging in, the danger signs began accumulating. Poundstone's prose is workmanlike at best. There are endless asides about the backgrounds of various mobsters tied to the gambling industry. And while Shannon's trips to Vegas (to beat blackjack and roulette, it turns out) are exciting and ingenious, the man was smart enough to quit once his intellectual curiosity had been satisfied. This is no <em>Bringing Down the House</em>. Vegas fades from the scene by the book's halfway point.</p>
<p>But this is where Poundstone's project becomes clear. His language loosens, his transitions from explanation to narrative become more fluid, and he starts calling people dopes. He enters his element, and embarks on the effort that excites him. Poundstone is not just fleshing out a fun Bell Labs footnote; he's telling a story about arbitrage and the modern finance industry.</p>
<p>In particular, he's telling the history of the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_criterion">Kelly Criterion</a>, an asset allocation formula -- aka betting system -- mathematically proven to maximize returns over the long run, given reinvestment of winnings and quantified odds. The story of the Kelly Criterion is interesting enough. Its foundations are rooted in Information Theory, the field Shannon singlehandedly invented, in part through the revelation that information works by reducing uncertainty -- and what is a gambler's edge if not a reduction in uncertainty? It's also fascinating to learn that despite its mathematical soundness, the Kelly Criterion apparently remains a subject of fierce debate, largely rejected by economists, finance experts and business schools thanks to a combination of practical, intellectual and cultural reasons (that it was invented by information theorists, not economists, doesn't help its cause).</p>
<p>But this book is about more than that. Poundstone mounts an implicit but still quite damning case against the modern finance industry. It's not just the slight seediness of mathematical concepts invented for roulette translating smoothly to Wall Street; it's the gangsters we were introduced to in the book's opening chapters make the trip, too, swept along by a conscious legal strategy (going legit) into a new form of gambling. By the time a young prosecutor named Rudolph Giuliani discovers he can use RICO, a law designed for the mob, to go after titans of finance, the story has become a fascinating moebius strip of money and risk. Is it a coincidence that <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_O._Thorp">Ed Thorp, the man who taught the world how to count cards</a>, is also the analytic mind behind <a class="reference external" href="http://historysquared.com/2012/01/06/performance-of-keynes-hedge-fund-chest-fund-1927-1945/comment-page-1/">one of the first and most successful hedge funds in history</a>?</p>
<p>Thorp comes out of this book looking like a singular genius, and a probably-ethical one, to boot. I'm convinced, but some suspicion is warranted -- Poundstone seems to have gotten a lot of help from him in putting this book together. Still, the man's record of returns and lack of indictments speak for themselves.</p>
<p>Aside from the Kelly Criterion and Wall Street's strange bedfellows, there are two important takeaways to be had here:</p>
<p>First, Poundstone does a number on the Efficient Market Hypothesis. I think he treats it fairly, explaining the views of its proponents, its intellectual heritage and the debates surrounding it with nuance -- like Thorp, Paul Samuelson is portrayed as a brilliant and towering figure (I'm going to have to remember <a class="reference external" href="http://anecdotage.com/articles/21631/">this trick</a> of his -- what an amazing dick move). The random walk is explained, as are investment strategies that can succeed despite the market's unpredictability. Fees and common investor mistakes are acknowledged, and he allows no confusion about what a typical investor should do: buy an index fund and ignore anyone who tells you they can beat the market.</p>
<p>Still, by the end of the book it's very hard not to conclude that a few ubermenschen walk among us -- people like Thorp -- who can consistently identify systemic pricing errors and develop ingenious ways to profit from them. The history of hedge fund tactics is explained, and of course it turns out to be built on these manipulations, from the warrant-based delta hedge to junk bonds to leveraged buyouts.</p>
<p>Before you ask: yes, Poundstone considers the survivor-bias argument at length. But I was still convinced that these techniques have worked -- at least until they're disclosed and the market begins pricing them in. EMH proponents tend to hand-wave toward this pricing-in happening with calculus-like instantaneity, but the actual history makes it clear that the process has sometimes taken months or years.</p>
<p>Second, and following from this, it's hard to read <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Fortunes-Formula-Scientific-Betting-Casinos/dp/0809045990/ref=sr_sp-atf_title_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1369066573&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=fortune%27s+formula">Fortune's Formula</a> and not conclude that finance has evolved toward (and probably past) a point of uselessness -- perhaps even destructiveness. Why does our society reward this kind of work? To provide better prices, they say, so that capital can be allocated more efficiently. The problem is that the process has no finish line. Arbitrage opportunities are discovered, profited from, and cease to exist; but Manhattan remains steadily expensive. So new arbitrage opportunities must be discovered or invented, via the sorts of exotic financial instruments that we've heard so much about these past years. But the low-hanging fruit is gone -- the margins on these deals are tiny, so they have to be amplified through incredible amounts of leverage. The complexity of the system inevitably sometimes reaches a point where interdependencies aren't fully realized -- Poundstone makes this point by narrating the epic destruction of <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-Term_Capital_Management">LTCM</a> -- and things blow up.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Fortunes-Formula-Scientific-Betting-Casinos/dp/0809045990/ref=sr_sp-atf_title_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1369066573&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=fortune%27s+formula">Fortune's Formula</a> was published in 2006. Poundstone doesn't even need the Great Recession to make his point.</p>
<p>A few caveats. I'm not a great consumer of books about finance. I haven't even read <em>The Big Short</em>. It's very possible that these insights are less novel than they seemed to me.</p>
<p>But this book taught me quite a bit of history, more than a few financial concepts, and changed the way I think about investing/gambling/risk. I'm tempted to reread it, even if just to make sure I got the thrust of the early chapters right (if I'd known who Ed Thorp would become, I would've paid a bit more attention -- I had heard the name before, but didn't make the connection).</p>
<p>Highly recommended.</p>

                    <p>I'm not sure what to think of this one. Watts rattles off a ton of counterintuitive facts about human cognition, and they're facts that I love and am fascinated by -- this is what I spent my college years studying -- but I can't help but be irritated by his recitation of them.</p>
<p>A big part of this is his prose, which is pretentious and baroque. Three uses of &quot;calcareous&quot; in a single novel might not *sound* like a lot...</p>
<p>The mechanics of what's going on are often difficult to track. This isn't so much because of the alienness of the ideas on offer, like in <em>Quantum Thief</em>. It's more that the language obscures what's going on. It's quite a contrast from <em>Rendezvous with Rama</em>, another first-contact-with-a-questionably-populated-alien-craft story. The action is overwritten, and hard to track.</p>
<p>Watts also gives himself too much credit for the quality of the ideas he's offering. The motley crew of savants that he offers seem not-that-abnormal, to be honest. The idea that a mediating &quot;jargonaut&quot; is necessary to translate their bizarre utterances into baseline-human comprehensible intelligence seems implausible (even with some minor hand-waving about this being an edited account). His characterizations are fairly thin, too -- in light of this, giving one character multiple personalities seems like a particularly poor decision.</p>
<p>The biggest problem may be how overeager he is to get to his ideas. There's a distinct refusal to self-edit -- the closing notes of the book mention that his other sci-fi series, <em>Rifters</em> is available in unabridged form on his website, and indicates some kind of disagreement with the publisher about the shorter form the printed edition took. Hmm. One can't help but wonder if the ideas about the singularity, empathy, Searle's Chinese Room, qualia zombies, evolution and vampires (sigh) should have been pared down, at least slightly (at the very least the vampires should have been tossed).</p>
<p>Still, I have to admit that the book picks up in its final third. Watts proves to have been building toward something, and it's coherent and interesting. I'm not a huge fan of the consciousness-denying hypotheses that I associate with Dan Dennett and that Watts attributes to Thomas Metzinger. But they're presented mostly coherently (though consciousness is given seriously short shrift by Watts, particularly its likely role in organizing concepts so as to make technology possible). I'm more of a mystic, or at least sufficiently guilt-riddled as to want to embrace panpsychism. But I will admit that he's making an interesting argument, even if it is cobbled together from a truly wild hodge-podge of quite-tentative research and misstatements about electromagnetism.</p>
<p>A ton of people that I know love this book, and a ton more are intrigued by these philosophical questions. If you're less bugged by the writing than I am, you might really like it. For me it was just okay, though it earns points for its ambition.</p>

                    <p>I just reread this thing for the who-knows-how-many-th time. It's still quite funny! But it's interesting to read it as an adult:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The humor is a little harder to take than it used to be, having now been exposed to long years of amiable nerds gracelessly aping the Monty Python sensibility. Douglas Adams books are clearly another transmission vector for this tendency to tediously parrot (though Adams' own execution, while inarguably derivative, is fluid and hilarious).</li>
<li>It's quite nihilistic, thought mirthfully so. I suspect this had a big influence on my own comedic preferences.</li>
<li>It's also pretty libertarian in its perspective, particularly the passage with the ruler of the universe (though I suppose that's in the next book).</li>
<li>It's thin! Adams wasn't kidding about stopping mid-stream.</li>
<li>Ben's right that <em>The Restaurant at the End of the Universe</em> is less satisfying, largely thanks to its repetition of jokes. I think things get quite a bit better further along, though, particularly in Adams' treatment of the Golgafrinchans, which is considerably more humane than the uniformly acid tone of the first book.</li>
<li>Last thought: Adams is of course mostly a humorist, but he's underrated as a stylist. Magrathea is spooky and lonely. The primeval earth is calming and lovely. England is small and homey. This talent really shines through in his nonfiction book <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Last-Chance-See-Douglas-Adams/dp/0345371984">Last Chance to See</a>, incidentally, which I recommend highly.</li>

                    <p>A really lovely history of Bell Labs and its incredible impact on the world. Gertner does a fantastic job of synthesizing existing historical accounts, while also unearthing his own wholly original findings through interviews and dives into the AT&amp;T archives.</p>
<p>I found the book particularly interesting since my job is all about managing technical staff who are trying to identify worthwhile problems and new ways of looking at them. I don't mean to compare our modest efforts to those of the people who invented the transistor, of course. But it was reassuring to have many of my engineer's intuitions about what makes for successful research environments -- adequate resources, plenty of freedom, good people, a focus on the questions themselves and a healthy tension between theory and application -- validated by the management theories captured in this book.</p>
<p>It's clear that Gertner has favorites among the cast of characters orbiting Bell Labs, but that's okay; so do I. His charming and moving account of Claude Shannon is particularly affecting, I thought. And it's hard to read this and not emerge a John Pierce fan. The treatment of Bill Shockley, by contrast, is relentlessly negative, though Gertner makes a strong case for this being wholly deserved.</p>
<p>My only other window into the Bell system is <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Master-Switch-Information-Empires/dp/0307390993/ref=sr_sp-atf_title_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1367725414&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=master+switch">Tim Wu's book</a>, which is notably unmentioned here, despite being published more than a year earlier than <em>The Idea Factory</em>. I assume this has something to do with publication lead times, something to do with Wu's book being an analysis that rehashes the same histories Gertner mined, and something to do with its less charitable perspective on AT&amp;T and its monopolistic activities. Still, an interesting omission.</p>
<p>Anyway, this is highly recommended for anyone inspired by digital technology or information theory. I think this will finally nudge me into reading the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Information-History-Theory-Flood/dp/1400096235/ref=sr_sp-atf_title_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1367725386&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=gleick">Gleick book</a> (as well as <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Fortunes-Formula-Scientific-Betting-Casinos/dp/0809045990/ref=sr_sp-atf_title_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1367725354&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=fortune%27s+formula">Fortune's Formula</a>, about Shannon's efforts to beat Vegas and the stock market -- that one, in particular sounds fantastic to me).</p>

                    <p>Beautifully written; this makes me want to read more Le Guin.</p>
<p>I wasn't bowled over by the ideas on offer. In part this is probably because this book is an innovator; others have used sci-fi to examine gender in more radical ways since, which makes this feel slightly tame.</p>
<p>But I suspect that my reaction is also in part because I'm a man. The signature implication of Gethenian physiology is that things in their culture aren't gendered. This mostly registered to me as bland ambiguity, but I can imagine that might have to do with my own gender being the default for so many things in my own culture (witness even Le Guin employing &quot;he&quot; as the pronoun used for ungendered characters).</p>
<p>But though I might have a blind spot when it comes to the novelty of the setting, I feel pretty confident in saying the plot is thin. It's driven largely by politics, but those politics are presented through a veil of intentionally alien concepts (shifgrethor, for example) that prevent the reader from feeling excited, <em>Wolf Hall</em>-style, even when very little is actually happening.</p>
<p>Inscrutable political shuffling then gives way to some heroic questing, but with an extremely spare cast of characters. That's fine for a Jack London story, but I'm not sure it works here -- particularly since Le Guin shies away from making us uncomfortable with the Ai/Estraven dynamic's final destination.</p>
<p>Basically: needed more kemmering.</p>

                    <p>Really interesting, and wins points for bothering with characterizations. I'm not sure how much sense it makes, though. In this world both food calories and fossil fuels have become massively more expensive (due to engineered plagues and depletion/climate change, respectively). But this leads to <em>more</em> of the energy economy being driven by food calories? Mastodons are not an efficient energy storage mechanism! Where are the solar panels and nukes and wind turbines and tidal power?</p>
<p>Aside from that I have three main complaints. First, the book's climax feels disjointed and loses the winning human scale of earlier action -- the characters who've been built up in earlier phases are left on the sidelines while the action moves through redshirts and cipherlike Thai generals. Second, the sexual exploitation of Emiko is porny in an unfortunate way. And third, Gibbons seems underutilized to the point where he's mostly just a Dr. Moreau throwaway.</p>
<p>The setting is pretty cool, though, and the neocolonial stakes are extreme and awesome. This is like Atwood's dystopic genomic imagination but played out through believable institutions.</p>

                    <p>People seem ready to hate Google Glass!</p>
<p>Yesterday there was the Tumblr <a class="reference external" href="http://whitemenwearinggoogleglass.tumblr.com/">White Men Wearing Google Glass</a>. This is not only slightly mystifying -- a <a class="reference external" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=google+glass&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=S7SCUcO9OZjI4APfwYDoBg&amp;ved=0CAoQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=752&amp;sei=T7SCUYmpLJK24AOsjIH4Cg">Google image search for &quot;Google Glass&quot;</a> returns what seems like a pretty diverse collection of testers and models -- but, speaking as a white man who aspires to wearing Google Glass (at least briefly), hard not to take a little bit personally. In fairness to the Tumblr's author, Robert Scoble is a faintly ridiculous person, and adding &quot;screaming&quot; and &quot;in the shower&quot; certainly does not yield a net improvement in gravitas. This is, arguably, another fitful effort to delineate a gendered subtext to Glass, a project started when Sergey Brin stupidly described smartphone use as &quot;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/27/sergey-brin-emasculating_n_2776389.html">emasculating</a>&quot; during a TED sales pitch. (I think the most plausible reading is that he intended the word to mean &quot;disempowering&quot; rather than &quot;womanly&quot;, but the charitableness of your reading may reasonably differ.)</p>
<p>This isn't the only place where people are picking sides between Team Glass and Team Glass Is Stupid And Bad. Earlier today Wired published a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.wired.com/business/2013/05/inherent-dorkiness-of-google-glass/">truly awful essay</a> by Marcus Wohlson predicting Glass's failure for different (though still Scoble-related!) reasons. It begins by erecting a geek/nerd continuum best left to Joss Whedon fan boards, goes on to a question-begging explanation of Segway's lack of success, and concludes by belittling Glass's lack of coolness -- as if coolness was an objective quality rather than something constructed collectively by people like the author himself. It's a bit mind-boggling that anyone could so thoroughly fail to see the arbitrary nature of culture. (The best reply to the Wired piece is probably <a class="reference external" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bianca-bosker/google-glass_b_2863848.html">this great post by Bianca Bosker discussing the history of eyeglass adoption</a>. But for a shortcut, the next time you see a world leader wearing a business suit, reflect on whether Europeans just happened to come up with the objectively awesomest formal attire.)</p>
<p>Watching people declare their tribal loyalties is fascinating and wearying. It's not surprising behavior, exactly: this product launch is a big, SEO-worthy cultural event, and one wouldn't want to be caught un-jaded. Certainly I don't: I've cheerfully presented from a slide deck making <a class="reference external" href="http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/35318157.jpg">dumb Dragonball Z jokes at Glass's expense</a>.</p>
<p>Nor should consumer tribalism be surprising to anyone who's read John Gruber's ongoing project to construct a theodicy of Apple, or anyone who has spoken to a teenager for thirty seconds. For people who don't enjoy getting angry about sports or religion or nationalism or politics, consumer gadgets seem to fill the void.</p>
<p>Still, in this case I can't help being irked by these reactions. I tend to emotionally align against new tech products (&quot;that's dumb/it's been done&quot;), so this might seem hypocritical.</p>
<p>But don't you have to respect the <em>ambition</em> of Glass? This is the most daring project I've seen in ages. Not just automation of an existing system of transport/food delivery/coupons. Not a privatized homage to NASA triumphs of decades past.</p>
<p>Consider what a persistent connection to the network means. Already I find myself giving up on learning certain classes of information -- why would I need to remember a friend's address or a bus schedule or a business's hours? Those parts of my mind now exist in my phone, and sure, the retrieval times are poor, but the integrity and capacity are excellent. Narrowing the latency of that interface further would be a profound change.</p>
<p>And that's to say nothing of the implications of persistent enmeshment in the conversations and status competitions of social media. You can take your strange, geographyless social universe with you on the go! On your head (if not yet in it)! You will be fully in one place even less often than you are now. If Twitter is like telepathy, Google Glass strives to be like astral projection*.</p>
<p>I suspect that humans' individual nervous and collective social systems aren't currently capable of dealing with this. Either Glass will flop or we will. For what it's worth, I think the former is pretty likely (battery or input bandwidth are where I'd place my bets) and, failing that, the latter is all but certain. But I don't really know. I am certain, though, that Glass is a wildly ambitious transhumanist project, a crazed conceptual art piece being executed on a massive scale with, mystifyingly, real engineering and industrial muscle behind it.</p>
<p>I have no idea if it'll succeed; I have no idea if I want it to succeed. But carping about its coolness is like complaining about the case color of the first A-bomb. To hell with that. Even the privacy argument about Glass strikes me as shallow.</p>
<p>The question is: what does Glass and its successors aim to turn us into? Is it something we want to become, or can become? And if it's to fail, can it please, please be for reasons more profound than fashion or lack of 4G?</p>
<p>* ask me about my <em>Doctor Strange</em>-themed trend piece pitch!</p>

<blockquote>
[... Y]ou never had the technology of perfection that was as available and as cheap and as ubiquitous. You never had Google Glasses before, you never had self-driving cars, you never had doors that recognise who you are and let you in.</blockquote>
<p>We still don't have two of those things; declaring them &quot;technologies of perfection&quot; seems premature. <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(lock)#History_of_locks_and_keys">Wikipedia says we've had the third technology for about four millennia</a>. &nbsp;I agree that connecting the system to Klout instead of &nbsp;human-mediated systems of status-determination is annoying, but it seems like an incremental change.</p>
<blockquote>
If [Valley royalty with political ambitions] join the Democrats or the Republicans, then it would be very boring. If some of them decide to go and resurrect the democracy movement, then that would be very exciting to write about.</blockquote>
<p>It was initially a bit gobsmacking to see a critic of Silicon Valley's political naivete declare that an tech-led attempt to create a third party would be &quot;very exciting to write about.&quot; But perhaps he finds this exciting in the same sense that a hunter looks forward to a deer wandering into a meadow.</p>
<blockquote>
In America, you need to drive and you need to drive more and more</blockquote>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/04/22/why-arent-younger-americans-driving-anymore/">Vehicle miles traveled is declining</a>, and the global trend is toward urbanization. But his point about the potential effect of self-driving cars on the commuting equilibrium is well-taken.</p>
</li><!--  -->
<blockquote>
As drones get cheaper and 3D printers get cheaper, all that can be done in a very different manner. And there will be huge implications for mobility from 3D printers, which again some people don’t expect.</blockquote>
<p>3D printers are mostly good for producing alternatives to injection-molded plastic and, to a lesser extent, ceramic and metal, in applications where price and the strength of the material are not important considerations. Looking around my desk, the items that could plausibly be produced by 3D printer -- without an expert to assemble other pieces, at which point the automation rationale falls apart -- include a coffee scoop, a pencil case, and a few collectible figurines. And I assure you that my desk is extremely messy.</p>
<p>Products like this are mostly imported and cost basically nothing, and consequently there's not going to be a ton of capital available to build a huge same-day iPhone case-manufacturing infrastructure. Yes, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/11/30/tech/innovation/staples-3-d-printing">Staples is going to offer in-store 3D printing</a>, and yes, I am pretty excited about it for hobbyist reasons. But it's going to be a niche. This technology will continue to have a growing impact on industrial design (where it's been in use for decades), fabrication of bespoke objects like running shoes and medical implants, and might make some consumer goods slightly more feasibly repairable. But I think people are confusing &quot;how super-cool is this technology?&quot; with &quot;how likely is this technology to change how we live and work?&quot; Seriously, go give <a class="reference external" href="http://www.thingiverse.com/">Thingiverse</a> a good look. It's lovely work, and some of it would be quite handy (albeit wildly expensive compared to existing injection-molded or stamped alternatives). But not that much of it.</p>
<p>Most useful objects are made of multiple materials, and 3D printing is not yet very good at that kind of fabrication. Perhaps it will grow to be! In the meantime, I suggest that optimists try pricing a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tn0EKtLOVx4">pick-and-place machine</a>, then imagine what it might cost to buy one that works in three dimensions. My next pair of sneakers could be 3D printed; parts of my next bicycle probably will be; my next kneecap <em>certainly</em> ought to be. But this is a tiny fraction of the manufactured world.</p>

<p>I have loved the Toynbee tiles for a while. They're all over the east coast, and Philadelphia in particular. There's something urgent and singular about them. I'd looked the phenomenon up on Wikipedia a few times, but what I found was always just a description of a mystery.</p>
<p>But it's a mystery that turns out to be solved. My colleague Bob pointed me toward <a class="reference external" href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Resurrect_Dead_The_Mystery_of_the_Toynbee_Tiles/70170048?locale=en-US">this documentary</a>, which I watched tonight and really enjoyed. I won't say it's the most artfully composed film, but the story it tells is wonderful.</p>
<p>The underlying impetus is necessarily about mental illness, and as with every fascinating story in this vein, one is all but certain to find tragedy if the temptation to keep digging is indulged for too long.&nbsp;Luckily (though perhaps also callously) the film avoids this, while still convincingly explaining the Toynbee tile mystery.</p>
<p>Spoiler alert, I guess: one industrious stranger has been fixated, for decades, upon the idea that science will be able to deliver the afterlife that he feels God has promised but failed to deliver. Molecules will be traced to their historical source, and reassembled, and life will be renewed. On Jupiter.</p>
<p>It's crazy, of course, but watching the movie's subjects trace minute particles of information through decades, assembling them into a completely coherent whole--it's a thing to behold, and makes the tiles' thesis seem a little less nuts.</p>
<p>(Also worth noting: the extent to which this investigation is enabled by the internet has to give pause to anyone worried about our modern panopticon. The film doesn't dwell on this point, but it's absolutely clear that this mystery would have persisted--and perhaps never even been noticed--in the days before the net.)</p>

                    <p>I'm sympathetic to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2013/04/01/there_is_no_problem_with_twitter.html">what Matt says here</a>, but I think he misses the bigger value of Twitter snark: as long as journalists and experts use Twitter for social ends (whether by telling the best snarky joke or whatever) their participation in the medium will remain at least&nbsp;somewhat&nbsp;grounded.</p>
<p>The alternative is to make the professionalization of Twitter complete. I already have quite enough of that, thanks -- I don't need more of people pushing their day's clips at me through pathetically thin news-hook framing in what amounts to a really shitty, lossy RSS reader. Who would want that? I know it's fun when you're the one staring at ChartBeat (I do it all the time!), but for the people on the other end of the equation it's a drag, even if they don't realize it.</p>
<p>The great thing about Twitter is that you can absorb the thinking of and even interact with people who have a huge amount of expertise, who might be inaccessible via other means. They're steeped in whatever it is they work on constantly, and if you follow them you'll start to understand their perspective and vocabulary. But that works best when they're being honest. Honesty means direct, non-calculated, first-order interaction with the medium. And that won't happen unless they're able to satisfy human drives other than the need for clickthroughs, which to be honest seems like it might not have even been in Maslow's hierarchy in the first draft.</p>
<p>I'm glad that&nbsp;Nick Beaudrot has figured out that he wants to interact with Twitter on a more limited basis, I wish him luck with his self-promotion-only strategy, and if I had been following him before now I would cease doing so immediately.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> It occurs to me that <a class="reference external" href="/2009/07/02/after-twitter/">I wrote something similar a few years ago</a>. The framing's different, but the upshot -- that social network users attempting to avoid trivial content become a free rider problem -- seems relevant.</p>

                    <p>The folks at the Sk/oll W/orld Forum were nice enough to let me write <a class="reference external" href="http://skollworldforum.org/debate-post/big-data-as-societys-watchdog/">some rambling thoughts about &quot;Big Data&quot;</a> for publication in, I'm guessing, a glossy brochure that will be flipped through if any of their event's panels prove to be particularly tedious. I am grateful for the opportunity, and congratulate myself for not making any of the childish chewing tobacco jokes that were ripping through my mind during the process.</p>
<p>Normally I would sheepishly self-promote on Twitter and leave it at that. But it is maybe worth sharing how the editorial process went. &nbsp;I originally wrote a piece that said, &quot;You know, this stuff isn't really new--the analysis of quantitative data and its application to social policy are at least a century old, and we probably shouldn't expect any sudden home runs. But it is true that some new things are being measured lately, so who knows, we might figure some new stuff out.&quot;</p>
<p>This was totally inverted, though, to emphasize the exciting new types of data and to minimize my yawning ho-hummery about the limits of technocratic governance. And it's true that this inversion makes for a much more compelling piece! The editors I worked with did their jobs well (though I'll admit I have no idea what the hed has to do with the piece).</p>
<p>But consider this datapoint when you read things about Big Data, or really any technology. Unless you achieve Morozovian levels of learnedness and vituperation, you're not going to place anything that amounts to &quot;Don't Believe the Hype.&quot;</p>

<p>It really is unfinished -- chapters end abruptly, discussions are alluded to that were clearly never written -- and the whole thing is written (but not formatted) in Markdown. But it contains an extremely high percentage of Correct Opinions About The Web. Here's one bit I particularly enjoyed about the Semantic Web (seemingly since relabeled as Linked Data, basically in order to escape this well-earned critique):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have to say, however, the idea’s proponents do not escape culpability for these utopian perceptions. Many of them have gone around talking about the “Semantic Web” in which our computers would ﬁnally be capable of “machine understanding.” Such a framing (among other factors) has attracted refugees from the struggling world of artiﬁcial intelligence, who have taken it as another opportunity to promote their life’s work.</p>
<p>Instead of the “let’s just build something that works” attitude that made the Web (and the Internet) such a roaring success, they brought the formalizing mindset of mathematicians and the institutional structures of academics and defense contractors. They formed committees to form working groups to write drafts of ontologies that carefully listed (in 100-page Word documents) all possible things in the universe and the various properties they could have, and they spent hours in Talmudic debates over whether a washing machine was a kitchen appliance or a household cleaning device.</p>
<p>With them has come academic research and government grants and corporate R&amp;D and the whole apparatus of people and institutions that scream “pipedream.” And instead of spending time building things, they’ve convinced people interested in these ideas that the ﬁrst thing we need to do is write standards. (To engineers, this is absurd from the start—standards are things you write after you’ve got something working, not before!)</p>
<p>And so the “Semantic Web Activity” at the Worldwide Web Consortium (W3C) has spent its time writing standard upon standard: the Extensible Markup Language (XML), the Resource Description Framework (RDF), the Web Ontology Language (OWL), tools for Gleaning Resource Descriptions from Dialects of Languages (GRDDL), the Simple Protocol And RDF Query Language (SPARQL) (as created by the RDF Data Access Working Group (DAWG)).</p>
<p>Few have received any widespread use and those that have (XML) are uniformly scourges on the planet, offenses against hardworking programmers that have pushed out sensible formats (like JSON) in favor of overly-complicated hairballs with no basis in reality (I’m not done yet!—more on this in chapter 5).</p>
<p>Instead of getting existing systems to talk to each other and writing up the best practices,these self-appointed guarantors of the Semantic Web have spent their time creating their own little universe, complete with Semantic Web databases and programming languages. But databases and programming languages, while far from perfect, are largely solved problems. People already have their favorites, which have been tested and hacked to work in all sorts of unusual environments, and folks are not particularly inclined to learn a new one, especially for no good reason. It’s hard enough getting people to share data as it is, harder to get them to share it in a particular format, and completely impossible to get them to store it and manage it in a completely new system.</p>
<p>And yet this is what Semantic Webheads are spending their time on. It’s as if to get people to use the Web, they started writing a new operating system that had the Web built-in right at the core. Sure, we might end up there someday, but insisting that people do that from the start would have doomed the Web to obscurity from the beginning.</p>
<p>All of which has led “web engineers” (as this series’ title so cutely calls them) to tune out and go back to doing real work, not wanting to waste their time with things that don’t exist and, in all likelihood, never will. And it’s led many who have been working on the Semantic Web, in the vain hope of actually building a world where software can communicate, to burnout and tune out and ﬁnd more productive avenues for their attentions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Entertaining, brutal and accurate. Swartz does more or less succumb to the dream of the Semantic Web again in his conclusion. But who knows, maybe one day someone will deliver on it.</p>

<p>I found him at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.uncommonobjects.com/">Uncommon Objects</a>, a really lovely and fun antique-y shop on Congress. They had <a class="reference external" href="http://instagram.com/p/V4ovyNvEMe/">a bunch of beautiful old radio stuff</a>, but this was the only thing I walked away with. It's a strange little piece -- just a sheet metal enclosure for a voltmeter, probably from a test bench of some sort. Those two ports on the front were originally for connecting to the voltage being measures (though the internal wires connecting them to the meter had been snipped by the time I got to it).</p>
<p>It took a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/8538628589/in/photostream/">little work</a>, but I've given this guy a brain:</p>

<p>That's a wifi-enabled Raspberry Pi which can drive the VU meter. I also added a red and an amber LED (also controllable via the Pi). &nbsp;I haven't figured out what I want to measure just yet, but I'm sure something will come to me.</p>
<p>I've been trying to get a VU meter-driven project together for a while now, but between the software, hardware and enclosure, I was feeling a little overwhelmed. Having the enclosure taken care of made this a pleasant stepping stone. &nbsp;Details/thoughts/tips:</p>
<p><strong>Networking</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Linux wifi is a huge pain in the ass. Finding a card with a compatible chipset is your first major task. Lady Ada has helpfully identified a pretty cheap one and sells it <a class="reference external" href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/814">here</a>. I bought a slightly cheaper Monoprice card with my BeagleBone in mind, and it works fine with the Pi's default Raspbian distro -- no messing with firmware downloads or 'nothin.</li>
<li>Wifi cards suck up a lot of juice, and the Pi can't supply very much over its USB ports. You might need a powered hub. The revision 2 Pi can power this adapter okay, but only if you boot with it in -- plug it into a running system and the current draw will force a system reset.</li>
<li>I hate messing with wpa_supplicant. The wicd package and its wicd-curses interface are your friends. But do&nbsp;<em>not</em> try to use them over SSH. The system flushes its routing when it sets up a new connection, and your SSH connection will get killed halfway through any connection to a wifi network, even if your SSH session started over ethernet. And then weird stuff will happen, like the wifi taking over the ethernet IP. It took me forever to figure out what was going on -- I thought maybe the current draw of connecting to a network was bringing the system down. The moral turns out to be: use a keyboard and monitor until you've got a system that reliably boots and connects to the wireless network.</li>
<li>I've got <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/sbma44/rpi/blob/master/bootstrap.sh">a simple Raspbian bootstrap script</a> that updates things and sets up a Python environment. You might find it useful -- though you'll probably want to remove the part that gives my public key access to your system :-/</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Hardware</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">The meter was designed to measure a voltage range of 0-15V; delightfully, it still did this pretty well, despite being an antique! But the Raspberry Pi's PWM only outputs a max of 3.3V. I had already bought a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/Boost-Buck-Voltage-Module-3-35V-to-2-2-30V-Step-Up-Down-Converter-Regulator-/290833291375?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&amp;hash=item43b703d86f">cheapo buck converter off of ebay</a> before Timball reminded me that VU meters are basically just galvos, and use resistors to set their range. Here's what the inside looks like:</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/8532279025/"><img alt="Staring down some resistor network math to convert a 15v VU meter to 5v. Boo." class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8233/8532279025_da5402b70e_n.jpg" style="width: 320px; height: 320px;" /></a></p>
<p>The resistor's in the upper left. I dug out <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Practical-Electronics-Inventors-2-E/dp/0071452818">my old standby</a>, reminded myself <a class="reference external" href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ResistorNetwork.html">what a resistor network is</a>, and added a trim potentiometer in parallel with the existing resistor (it's the blue square on the far right of the second picture in this post). Through some careful tuning with a screwdriver I was able to make the arm sweep all the way to the 15 with just the weensy 3.3V of the maxed-out Pi. Hurrah!</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">I also added a couple of status-indicator LEDs to the bottom of the meter. Their placement isn't ideal, but you can see&nbsp;<em>something</em> when they're on, at least. The meter wasn't designed to accommodate them, so I had limited options.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The LED holes and the entry point for the system's power cable both required some Dremeling. Having sparks of hot metal showering your arm can be counted on to prompt some justified self-congratulation about wearing eye protection. Yeesh.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Software</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The <a class="reference external" href="https://projects.drogon.net/raspberry-pi/wiringpi/">wiringpi</a> library and its <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/WiringPi/WiringPi-Python">Python bindings</a> are designed to be pleasantly Arduino-like. Setup is &nbsp;as easy as `sudo apt-get install -y python-dev &amp;&amp; pip install wiringpi`. By default, you have to run your GPIO/PWM-manipulating scripts as root -- there's an alternate method available, but I couldn't get the /sys/ GPIO interfaces to work properly in userland (though I didn't try very hard). Ah well.</li>
<li>Pay attention to the variability in pin names. wiringpi uses the pin numbers of the underlying microcontroller, not the numbers from the Pi connector. <a class="reference external" href="https://projects.drogon.net/raspberry-pi/wiringpi/pins/">This table will help you translate between the two</a>. Unless you're doing <a class="reference external" href="http://blog.makezine.com/2013/02/12/pi-blaster-improves-software-pwm-on-raspberry-pi/">something crazy</a>, the Pi's sole PWM comes out of GPIO1, which is &quot;pin 1&quot; to wiringpi and pin 18 on the Raspberry Pi connector.</li>
<li>The software I wrote to run this thing is nothing special, though there is one convenience library you might enjoy: <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/sbma44/texameter">pwmcalibrate.py</a>. Using a curses interface, it slowly steps down the PWM output from max to zero, recording the active PWM setting as you hit spacebar, which you should do as the needle crosses each step on the meter. This data is used to create a calibration file that can be easily reloaded, allowing you to set the meter by the desired display value without having to think about it much. It also does some simple linear interpolation if you ask for a value that's between recorded calibration steps. I'm pretty pleased with how it performs, though the meter itself seems to display some performance variability at the low end of its range. Probably nothing to be done about this, given the age of the hardware. Oh, and it will slowly step down the PWM when making transitions, if you ask it to. This is worth doing if you don't want the needle to bounce around a ton.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think that's it. Now I just need to hook it up to something worth measuring. Or Twitter, I guess.</p>

                    <p>It's no fun to argue with the dead, but sometimes it can't be helped. Or at least, I can't help myself.</p>
<p>I've tried to limit how much I say about Aaron Swartz's death, because I'm not sure I have much right to say anything. I only met the guy a couple of times, exchanged a couple of emails, replied to a few tweets. We were not friends, and I understand that I don't deserve to grieve the loss of him the way his loved ones do. That would be distasteful and presumptuous of me.</p>
<p>But it is true that Aaron was part of an embarrassingly small pool of technologists that I revere -- people toward whom I do not feel my usual, regrettable reflex toward rivalrous, Holden Caulfieldish pissiness. Instead, I was in awe of Aaron. I told the PACER story frequently, and I read his book reviews with disbelief. (I didn't realize it at the time, but I suppose I must have begun my Goodreads book-reviewing habit as a way of emulating him.)</p>
<p>I didn't know him well, but I sort of thought that someday I would, when (if!) I had done something that earned me the right. The fact that this will never happen is something that I suspect I haven't fully grasped.</p>
<p>I've been reading a lot of his old stuff this week, and today that included the chapter he contributed to the book <em>Open Government</em>, which O'Reilly Media <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/oreillymedia/open_government">generously open-sourced as a memorial to Aaron</a>. Entitled &quot;When Is Transparency Useful?&quot;, I think it could fairly count as one of the &quot;high-profile, public denunciations&quot; that Cory Doctorow mentioned in <a class="reference external" href="http://boingboing.net/2013/01/12/rip-aaron-swartz.html">his remembrance of Aaron</a>.</p>
<p>Aaron began work on a project supported by Sunlight, but he ultimately decided it was fruitless and abandoned it before completion. This was all before my time, but I know it resulted in some hurt feelings. I'm sorry things ended that way, because in this case I think Aaron got it wrong. He had good company, though: people like Lessig and Clay burned out on transparency, too.</p>
<p>I haven't, and I don't think I will. My understanding of how transparency works is different, I suspect (and probably different from that of my colleagues). It might be worth writing it down here, in advance of the next ally that loses faith.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>So. Let's say we're running a school. The school has a cafeteria, which is largely unmonitored. In political theory we would call this a Hobbesian state of nature, but never mind that for now.</p>
<p>Within this cafeteria we have a bullying problem. Some kids make a regular practice of socking other kids in the gut and demanding their lunch money, which is then handed over. This is against the rules, of course, but enforcement is imperfect. Sometimes a teacher will be passing through and catch a bully in the act, or a victim will muster enough evidence and courage to tattle effectively. When that happens, detention is assigned to the bully. Along with anecdotal evidence, the number of detentions forms our sense both of the extent of the bullying problem and of how effectively we're fighting it.</p>
<p>Eventually, repeated petitions from the members of the Audio-Visual Club convince us that this situation is intolerable, and we agree to install some surveillance cameras in the cafeteria. We can't monitor every moment of footage, of course, but we make a concerted effort at the start, handing out tons of detention slips. Soon the bullies wise up, the on-camera punching stops, and the detention hall sits empty.</p>
<p>There are a lot of potential problems with this. Maybe the bullies have taken to waiting for the A.V. Club by the flagpole after school. Maybe they're issuing verbal threats instead of physical ones. Maybe the invasion of student privacy that the cameras represent is a substantial harm that outweighs the reduction in bullying.</p>
<p>But it would be pretty silly to look at the empty detention hall and conclude that it means the cameras aren't working. And it would be downright stupid if we gave in to disappointment because we find our lack of bullies to punish less emotionally satisfying than the pre-camera days.</p>
<p>Besides, even if the system isn't perfect, it's still probably harder for bullies to catch kids when they're running past the flagpole instead of massed in the lunchroom. If the threats are now verbal, at least fewer people are getting punched.</p>
<p>You can argue that other reforms would be superior, and I might agree with you. Having the school sell lunch plans that eliminate the need for carrying cash, for instance, might make this entire problem disappear. But I do think that the cameras were a useful intervention, even if they fall short of &quot;silver bullet&quot; status.</p>
<p>Obviously it's easy for me to concoct this story. <a class="reference external" href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1922859">But there's evidence that this is how transparency actually works</a>.</p>
<p>It's deeply unsatisfying, I know! Believe me, I dream about our databases leading to corrupt politicians being marched off in handcuffs. It'd make for some great stories -- I suspect grant officers would much rather hear about that stuff than about unmeasurable counterfactuals (&quot;Why should we keep paying for these videotapes when they don't show any bullying?&quot;). If I'm honest, though, it's probably a better idea to raise the costs of bad behavior so that it doesn't happen as much, rather than trying to catch bad behavior after it happens.</p>
<p>Perhaps this isn't enough to fix things. But it really can help.</p>

                    <p>Paul Ford <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/ftrain/status/288336443489808384">got it about right on George Saunders</a>, I think: his gift is his ability to inspire empathy. He is sardonic and funny, and this somehow gives him license to pursue huge emotional honesty without readers dismissing the proceedings as maudlin.</p>
<p>This collection is very good. &quot;Victory Lap,&quot; the opening story, is astounding and scary and nearly overwhelming -- I took it to be about the line between righteousness and self-righteousness. &quot;Sticks&quot; is brief, great and brutal. &quot;Escape from Spiderhead&quot; might be the closest to the Saunders I met in <a class="reference external" href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28747.CivilWarLand_in_Bad_Decline">CivilWarLand in Bad Decline</a>, writing characters that shrug through corporate dystopia on their way to pathos and transcendence (here, the point seems to be about the arbitrary nature of romantic love compared to the universality of compassion, which I'm not sure I buy but was certainly moving). &quot;Home&quot; is lovely, and the story that titles the collection is both affecting and pretty technically dazzling.</p>
<p>That same technical brilliance might be the collection's weakness, though. It's a strange thing we do to literary authors these days, holing them up at the head of MFA programs, where they can subject their own work to endless forensic analysis. I suppose it's one way to keep them fed, so, you know, fine. But, having read a messy, confused and deeply resonant Dick novel shortly before this book, I'm not sure how happy I am to have writers paring themselves down toward some literary tao. It occasionally manifests as a problem here, most notably in &quot;My Chivalric Fiasco,&quot; which seems to be purely a technical exercise. &quot;The Semplica Girl Diaries,&quot; the longest story, pairs that tendency with the bad decision to revolve around a dream that Saunders had and found haunting (there's a lot of nice and funny stuff in it about fatherhood, but it lacks Saunders' typically satisfying conclusions).</p>
<p>So I don't know. These stories are great, and I would recommend this collection highly. But if you're looking for a place to start I'd probably suggest <em>CivilWarLand In Bad Decline</em> first (that being the only other thing of his I've read -- <em>Pastoralia</em> is on the shelf, waiting...).</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>Ryan Avent has <a class="reference external" href="http://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21569381-idea-innovation-and-new-technology-have-stopped-driving-growth-getting-increasing?fsrc=scn/tw_ec/has_the_ideas_machine_broken_down_">a very, very good article on the state of innovation</a>. You should go read it. I come down on the pessimistic-but-waiting-to-be-surprised side -- it really looks to me like fossil fuels were a one-time (and possibly impermanent) equilibrium-shifter -- but Ryan makes a very strong case, and there's really nothing I can disagree with.</p>
<p>I do have a handful of reactions, but they're really just notes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Moore's Law is doing okay, but I've read a lot of people worrying that its translation into practical processing power isn't. In general, silicon photolithography seems to have given people a lot of bad ideas about technological progression being inevitably governed by exponential laws. I'd really like to see a kW-per-dollar versus time plot of electrical engine performance, for instance (I haven't been able to find one).</li>
<li>3D printing is an older technology than most people realize, which makes me think they're overestimating its upside. The medical applications are real and important; its implications for design processes are substantial; it will almost certainly become a useful neighborhood amenity, available at copy shops and the like. For manufacturing, its effects will be limited to expensive, small-run applications (like the aforementioned medical uses). It seems extremely unlikely to me that 3D printing's economic significance will be greater than that of the 2D printer industry. Which isn't nothing! But it's not flying cars either.</li>
<li>Predictions of sudden algorithmic progress that unlock new types of economic activity are more interesting, and clouded by two things. First, the Big Data trend story, which is a conceptual distraction that a lot of tenuously-relevant activity is being shoehorned into. Second, the research black boxes that are the dot-com survivors. Google, in particular, has bought up a ton of the world's best engineers and provided a sudden infusion of resources to scores of academics whose work would otherwise stand little chance of practical relevance. I think we still have only the vaguest idea of what this effort will produce. The performance of GOOG over the next few decades could turn out to be a pretty good test of Cowen's thesis.</li>
<li>The extensive versus intensive distinction is new to me, so I'm probably about to apply it incorrectly. But it seems to me that fossil fuel technology is profoundly extensive in nature -- it's as if you can suddenly convert horses to a nonperishable liquid, and better still, there's tons of it just lying around underground, free for the taking! These are new resources. Information technology, by contrast, is about intensifying existing activities by reducing communication friction. This is very important, but also the kind of thing that the market started working on in a serious way right after the telegraph was invented (and had been plugging away at before, of course, through couriers, postal systems, soldiers running back from the Battle of Marathon, etc). There's an incredibly long tail to build here -- smartphone-dispatched taxis, simplified appointments with the doctor, grocery delivery services you don't have to think about -- but it's mostly composed of known tasks that aren't sufficiently lucrative to merit hiring an unskilled human to coordinate. With enough of them, you can <a class="reference external" href="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.comicsalliance.com/media/2012/05/superman3poster.jpg">definitely make money</a>. I'm not sure how economically significant it'll wind up being, though (not least of all because consumers seem likely to capture a huge portion of the gains).</li>
</ul>
<p>So, yeah, same old opinions from me: a lack of imagination paired with pessimism about the upside of the technologies I understand best (borne of being close enough to them that I can find their limitations dismaying).</p>
<p>I do think there will probably be some big unexpected thing that will make fogeys of us all. But other than driverless cars or a sudden, later-than-expected payoff to genomic medicine, I don't see how any of the bets people are placing have enough upside to be the one that hits big.</p>

<p>Nothing against SnapChat! If people like it, that's great. But it's a good example of software success clearly driven by cultural factors rather than the inherent attributes of the app itself*. This distinction is very rarely made when people write about software fads, but it's important.</p>

                    <p><a class="reference external" href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/30/im-bored-whats-next/">Michael Arrington is bored</a>. About eight months ago, <a class="reference external" href="/2012/04/18/technology-is-driving-me-crazy/">Alexis Madrigal was similarly bored</a>. These guys are leaders in their field, and consequently I think their malaise is likely to spread. I suspect it has to -- that it's an inevitable consequence of the kind of mentality on display in this audio clip:</p>
<p>That's from NPR's &quot;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.npr.org/2012/12/31/168367414/tech-writers-five-best-apps-of-2012">Best Apps of 2012</a>&quot; piece. I think it's revealing: Brown picks an app in a done-to-death genre and *explicitly* says that novelty forms the basis of his excitement about it.</p>
<p>This statement can perhaps be dismissed as a Freudian slip, but I think it's representative of a subtext underlying most popular writing and thinking about technology and startup culture -- the elevation of &quot;<a class="reference external" href="http://techcrunch.com/events/disrupt-ny-2013/">disruption</a>&quot; as an end in itself is just as emblematic of this focus.</p>
<p>And perhaps that's fine: there's nothing wrong with enjoying novelty. I know that I derive a lot of utility from it, and consistently base various consumption decisions on it (&quot;What albums are on the 2012 year-end lists?&quot; versus &quot;Which of these albums are objectively better than my all-time favorites?&quot;). And at Sunlight we know that novelty is of huge importance: we rely on the press and public to spread the technology we build. We know that people will only be driven to do so if it excites them, and we know that novelty is one of our best tools for achieving that end.</p>
<p>For aesthetic consumption industries in general, pursuing novelty seems just fine. It's why books and music and movies and fashion organize themselves into trends and movements. It makes culture understandable and criticism rewarding. But, speaking as a software engineer, it can be an odd criterion to have to grapple with, and it has been slightly bizarre to watch its selection as the primary lens through which our culture perceives this discipline.</p>
<p>(It also seems like a pretty silly way to allocate financial resources when, unlike those other disciplines, reaching profitability is usually premised on a comfortably long product lifecycle, the idea of which is badly undercut by a focus novelty (though I suppose the possibility of hitting it rich as a fad does help with reaching scale). Then again, I don't really know anything about investing.)</p>
<p>It might be that all of this is obvious, but hearing that report on the radio made something click for me. And I think it marks a useful dividing line for tech journalism. Was this story written because its subject is new, or because its subject is important? For me, outlets like Ars, Techdirt and MIT Tech Review immediately come to mind as publications that consistently choose the latter rationale, and I think that has a lot to do with why I prefer them.</p>
<p>Some people really enjoy fashion. More power to them! There's no reason they can't enjoy software on those terms. But I do think that this type of tech connoisseurship is ill-served by the story it currently tells itself about its true motivations, which are usually said to be about convenience, economic importance, or more far-fetched ideas about the transformation of society. The problem isn't so much that these claims are incorrect (though they usually are) but that they ground what should be an artistic endeavor in a terminally boring bourgeois aesthetic. You are never going to get a punk rock photo app from someone who follows Fred Wilson on Twitter. In this respect, tech writers would be well-served to look to the <a class="reference external" href="http://superhexagon.com/">indie gaming scene</a> and hope that a similar miracle of independent taste and thinking can colonize the app store.</p>
<p>Anyway, you should give <a class="reference external" href="http://www.npr.org/2012/12/31/168367414/tech-writers-five-best-apps-of-2012">that NPR piece a listen</a>. There might be some apps in it you enjoy. And it has some good news for Mr. Madrigal: <a class="reference external" href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/02/gift-guide-philips-hue/">his lightbulbs-as-a-platform startup idea seems to have come to pass</a>.</p>

                    <p>Being the crotchety old man that I am, the time I spent this evening on my gym's treadmill left me feeling cantankerous. I had been watching Jeopardy, and all of the categories seemed horrible, dagnabit. Back in my day we didn't have questions about sitcoms! No, it was all Latin, and poetry, and similarly high-minded pursuits.</p>
<p>Then I got home and remembered I had a bunch of code left over from when we built&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2011/12/08/remembering-richard-cordray-nominee-and-jeopardy-champion/">this thing</a>. See, there is a terrifying website called <a class="reference external" href="http://j-archive.com">j-archive.com</a>. It's maintained by former players, and it comprehensively chronicles every game of Jeopardy.</p>
<p>It's possible to scrape this site to reconstruct games, which is what I did for the Cordray infographic. With this as a starting point, figuring out the percentage of categories devoted to television versus weightier topics was a relative cinch. I was absolutely confident that I would find a line snaking smoothly upward. Here are the regular expressions I used:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">[cc]RE_TV = re.compile(r'(T\.?V\.?|TELEVISION|SITCOM)', re.I)</div>
<div class="line">RE_BIBLE = re.compile(r'BIBL(ICAL|E)', re.I)</div>
<div class="line">RE_HISTORY = re.compile(r'(PRESIDENT|HISTORY|HISTORICAL)',re.I)[/cc]</div>
</div>
<p>And here's the graph that resulted (normalized by total number of categories in a season):</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="/static/2012/12/Screen-Shot-2012-12-21-at-12.02.03-PM.png"><img alt="image1" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2290" src="/static/2012/12/Screen-Shot-2012-12-21-at-12.02.03-PM.png" style="width: 628px; height: 425px;" /></a></p>
<p>Gotta say, I didn't see this one coming. I guess the nerds are (mostly) all right after all. Alex Trebek's still kind of a supercilious asshole, though.</p>
<p>Anyway, I'm open to other suggested analyses. Lay 'em on me.</p>

                    <p>Matt has a post up <a class="reference external" href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2012/12/13/ios_google_maps_if_it_s_great_thank_apple_s_strategy.html">arguing that today's debut of a seemingly-great Google Maps iOS app represents a strategic success for Apple</a>. The basic idea is that Google used its head-start on mapping to artificially retard the iOS maps experience, in an attempt to give Android a competitive advantage. Now, with Apple competing, they've been forced to deliver a first-class, free maps experience to Apple customers.</p>
<p>I think this is a valid description of the present dynamic, but not of how we got here -- the account of the underlying strategy is a bit too <a class="reference external" href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/10/04/1140078/-7-Dimentional-Chess-Master">7-dimensional-chess-y</a> for my tastes.</p>
<p>What really crystallized my thinking on the maps issue was a conversation with Eric Gundersen of Development Seed/<a class="reference external" href="http://www.mapbox.com">Mapbox</a>. Over beers at Townhouse, I asked him and his colleague Alex Barth what the hell was up with Apple's maps strategy. Why set up a gigantic and difficult new internal practice? Their lack of expertise meant they had low odds of success, it would be horribly expensive, and Google's model of offering free computing services to keep users in their ad ecosystem seemed like it was pretty compatible with Apple's needs.</p>
<p>Eric's response was pretty simple: &quot;The future is mobile, right? Mobile's about location. If you want to own that, you need to own the map layer.&quot;</p>
<p>I think that's right. This mapping fight isn't about iOS or Android specifically, but rather a play to avoid dependence/achieve dominance over an increasingly vital (and potentially expensive) informational asset. If your software giant steps into the ubiquitous computing/augmented reality era wholly dependent on a mapping provider with monopoly power -- which Google was on track to be -- you'd be pretty well boned.</p>
<p>So they made an investment (though a rather chintzy one, by some accounts), took a reputational hit, and have their fingers crossed that iOS's popularity will subsidize the development of their mapping stack into a competitive informational asset.</p>
<p>Google, meanwhile, is facing its own headaches. &nbsp;It's only in the last year that they've tried to monetize GMaps in a big way, and almost immediately they were forced to drop their prices due to credible competition from upstarts like the aforementioned <a class="reference external" href="http://www.mapbox.com">Mapbox</a> (which is pretty awesome, by the way, and deserving of a&nbsp;<em>lot</em> more fawning profiles than I've seen so far -- if you want a DC software startup with a credible plan for world domination, they're the ones you should be talking to, not the guys selling coupons).</p>
<p>So Google's clinging to its vision of a consumer mapping monopoly, I think, by focusing on the quality of their offerings. It's a credible approach: <a class="reference external" href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a> still has licensing problems, everyone hates Apple Maps, and Google's privileged access to oceans of information about consumers' preferences and desires really does give them a competitive advantage. They have <a class="reference external" href="http://maps.google.com/intl/en/help/maps/streetview/#utm_campaign=en&amp;utm_medium=van&amp;utm_source=en-van-na-us-gns-svn">geographic information that no one else seems to have</a>, and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/larry-page-finally-explains-why-google-is-working-on-self-driving-cars-2012-12">ambitious engineering projects</a>&nbsp;that are going to be very, very difficult for competitors to replicate without paying Google for GIS privileges.&nbsp; So they're working to build an unapproachably awesome map stack, and retaining users is part of that -- as&nbsp;Apple Maps have <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/12/10/tech/apple-maps-australia-flaw/index.html">amply demonstrated</a>, there's no substitute for users using your product and slowly helping to refine it.</p>
<p>Matt's right that this dynamic is good for iOS users and consumers in general. It's competition! But I think the competition is happening over the map layer, not the handset OS layer. Geographic information isn't just a handset feature, it's a potential monopoly. These guys legitimately want to crush each other; it's not just brinksmanship in service of preserving a cross-firm subsidy.</p>

                    <p>Still, the lingering shreds of my 14 year-old self couldn't help wasting a few hours writing a convenience utility for extracting snippets from the Simpsons for throwaway-gag social media use. I did this despite realizing that, yes, quotation is a low and basically irritating form of humor -- it's basically the same as the bully with the audio-playing jacket in <em>Back to the Future II</em>&nbsp;. Still, if you've got a library of video you want to pull snippets from, <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/sbma44/simpclip">perhaps you'll find it useful</a>.</p>
<p>Important notes/caveats to this important work:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Having to upload to an FTP endpoint sucks. Using a video service would be great, not least because they'd handle the tedious ffmpeg tweaking I wasted a bunch of time on. And, in fact, I had this working with YouTube. But their copyright infringement detection algorithms are too good. It's a shame; I feel that quotation of this kind is fair use.</li>
<li>Quicktime is a real jerk, and ffmpeg is a mystery. For an embarrassingly long time I couldn't get Apple's default OS X codecs to play the H.264 file I was making (VLC played it no matter how badly I mangled the parameters, of course). Using the .mov contained was the trick. Bah.</li>
<li>Is there really no URL shortener that will work without an API key? Weird. Weird and stupid.</li>
</ul>
<p>Mostly this saves me a minor amount of trouble -- the command line is faster and more flexible than the VLC/SimpleMovieX/CyberDuck workflow I used to employ. But my real motivation has more to do with a pie-in-the-sky featureset I've daydreamed about for a while:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Enter text phrase</li>
<li>Search database of extracted subtitles for timestamps and surrounding text.</li>
<li>Select desired quotations.</li>
<li>Search for moments of audio silence surrounding the window indicated by the rough subtitle timestamping.</li>
<li>Potentially repeat the process with <a class="reference external" href="https://ffmpeg.org/trac/ffmpeg/ticket/442">video scene transition</a> data.</li>
<li>Plug results into today's script, automating the gap from remembering a line to pulling the video for it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Again, a huge waste of time. I don't even have a torrent with subtitles yet! And I have a ton of projects I ought to get to before then, not least of all my mom's website. But if I were a collective of infinite monkeys, I'd certainly tackle this. Hell, one could conceivably connect it to work, if you ignored C-SPAN's copyright and pulled all their video and transcription.</p>
<p>A more tractable next-step is probably adding animated GIFs as an output option.</p>

<p><script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p><p>An exaggeration, sure. And I should acknowledge that the article that prompted Ryan's tweet is a poor example of the form I'm about to discuss. But I do think that journalistic trolling is ascendant. And I think there are three trends that have led to this:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>First, there's an obvious glut of written material on the web thanks to technologically-lowered barriers to entry, an expanding tail of digitally-accessible archival content, and the continued desirability of writing as an occupation (whether professional or not, largely thanks to non-financial considerations).</li>
<li>Second, as <a class="reference external" href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox.html">Yglesias</a> has repeatedly noted, there are a bunch of new forms of leisure (videogames, social media) that are competing for a pool of consumer time that's only growing slowly (and which will ultimately hit physical and/or biological limits).</li>
<li>These first two trends lead to fierce competition, and combine with a third phenomenon: A/B testing and other forms of analytic instrumentation that make it easy to quantify which kinds of content are most profitable to produce.</li>
</ul>
<p>Pornography, cat pictures and aggregation are all known to fit the bill, but I think that direct, strategic assaults on readers' self-conception have only recently become a deliberate technique. To me, Slate's &quot;<a class="reference external" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=recipe+sucks+site%3Aslate.com&amp;oq=recipe+sucks+site%3Aslate.com&amp;aqs=chrome.0.57.3221&amp;sugexp=chrome,mod=16&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8#hl=en&amp;tbo=d&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;q=%22doing+it+wrong%22+site:slate.com&amp;oq=%22doing+it+wrong%22+site:slate.com&amp;gs_l=serp.3...1652.2433.0.2637.2.2.0.0.0.0.62.62.1.1.0.les%3B..0.0...1c.1.fPXZGjzsRtc&amp;pbx=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf.&amp;fp=1d332d38cdc82502&amp;bpcl=38625945&amp;biw=1418&amp;bih=752">You're Doing It Wrong</a>&quot; cooking columns are the epitome of the trend (&quot;you make pumpkin pie with condensed milk? you're an asshole&quot;), and represent a more dramatic divergence than one might first think from the counterintuitivism the brand is known (and gently teased) for. But examples are everywhere.</p>
<p>The opposite dynamic seems to work nearly as well: people love to be told that they're great just the way they are. I think this is the lens through which one should view much of Gawker Media's output, from their shaming of racist teens on Twitter to their outing of Violentacrez the Reddit troll. The moral judgments underlying these articles aren't wrong, which makes them very hard to argue against. But the public performance of those values is clearly about flattering the sensibilities of the audience -- &quot;gawker&quot; is exactly the right word for it. When the formula works, there's an element of triumphalist mob mentality to the proceedings. To me, at least, this often seems more odious than the pathetic and easily-dismissed troll's gambit.</p>
<p>In some cases, a single article can benefit from both strategies, simultaneously trolling and flattering. Usually this involves an attack on a cliched straw-man -- the NYT's <a class="reference external" href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/17/how-to-live-without-irony/">recent piece on hipsterism fits the bill</a>, as does <a class="reference external" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/nov/14/dude-or-dudebro-ten-ways-to-tell">this Philippic by Jill, er, Fillipovic</a>. You can count on some portion of the audience to angrily recognize themselves as the ones being caricatured, and another portion of the audience to pat themselves on the back for participating in the shaming of that imagined subclass. Everybody wins, except for the part where they've just demonstrated themselves to be petty, provincial rubes.</p>
<p>Not *everything* will descend to these forms. We will continue to see various kinds of content, even from outlets that embrace these strategies, thanks to editors' nostalgia, imperfect rationality, deliberate cross-subsidization strategies, and responsiveness to prestige-related incentives that allow them to deploy their position in a <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal%E2%80%93agent_problem">principal-agent</a> dynamic for personal gain.</p>
<p>But I do think that this gaming of human psychology is likely to remain ascendant, and to find new forms -- online journalism is, if nothing else, a rapidly evolving system. Still, as an audience member, <a class="reference external" href="/2010/12/05/more-efficiency-means-less-profit/">I really dislike feeling like I'm being manipulated</a>. I suppose all one can do is try to develop mental defenses to this kind of conceptual lure, and quietly pine for the simpler, more dignified days of nip-slip galleries.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>A quick observation.&nbsp;To me, the most interesting subtext of the pundit/quant pissing match that erupted in the late days of the campaign is the similarity it bears to the hoary aggregator/reporter handwringing we're all so used to.</p>
<p>Nate Silver is heavily dependent on publicly available polling data, much of which is funded by media organizations. Those organizations engage in polling both to allocate resources and -- probably more importantly -- to generate grist for stories. Attracting attention to stories written about the back-and-forth of individual poll results is an important part of how these polls are paid for. Silver's work not only implicitly and explicitly tells us that such stories are a waste of time, but offers a substitute product that can be consumed more efficiently (and which, for the time being, has the benefit of novelty).</p>
<p>In both this and the familiar &quot;oh no Buzzfeed/HuffPo/DCist/whatever&quot; case, readers are being offered a distilled, intensified information product that has been created from more basic inputs. Those inputs are paid for by the value that their creators -- media companies -- derive from advertising. Aggregators capture some of that value for themselves. To the extent that all of this is zero-sum, the producers of the inputs feel that the aggregators are free-riding and endangering the entire ecosystem. I think that this explains a lot of the animus directed toward Silver.</p>
<p>In the case of content aggregation, we seem to have reached an uneasy truce. And good for us! But this is more reflective of the media's admirable commitment to openness than it is of a sustainable equilibrium being figured out -- though of course the increasing amounts of original reporting done by the aggregators is encouraging.</p>
<p>Perhaps poll aggregators will follow a similar route and begin collecting their own data, though this seems somewhat unlikely given the startup costs involved. Perhaps more plausibly, one could imagine a growing dependence on data gathered by universities. Everyone wants to be a research institution, after all -- prestigious new polling operations seem like a viable destination for ballooning tuition fees, shifting the source of Silver's received subsidy from media to the education sector. It also seems likely that polling will increasingly find ways to use the huge amounts of data that voters now accidentally generate on a continuous basis, and aggregators like Silver might be able to do some of this themselves thanks to the problem's amenability to automation. (Notably, the price that this data's owners will set still seems unclear.)</p>
<p>So I think we'll be fine -- to the extent that we need polls, I suspect that our need will be satisfied. (Though that extent is unclear -- campaigns will continue to pay for private polls to guide strategy, of course, but I suspect that poorer information for election-watchers might be utility-enhancing, since uncertainty is entertaining.)&nbsp;But I do think it's interesting to view the current, superficially inexplicable animus toward Silver through the more familiar lens of what's been happening elsewhere.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> <a class="reference external" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=4288">Another perspective</a>. I think a preference for simplistic accounts is made possible by structural factors like those discussed above, though.</p>
<p><strong>ALSO:</strong> Seems like Henry Farrell wrote something very similar just after midnight this morning -- I've only just read his post now (11PM) but it's <a class="reference external" href="http://themonkeycage.org/blog/2012/11/07/is-nate-silver-incentive-compatible/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+themonkeycagefeed+%28The+Monkey+Cage%29">certainly worth a look</a>.

                    <p>Well, I think that about does it for my Man Booker season. The winner is set to be announced on October 16th, and while I might be able to get one more short list entry read before then, my heart's not in it. There are a few reasons for this. Perhaps most importantly, my guesses about what would make it through from the long list have been much less lucky than <a class="reference external" href="/2011/10/04/the-man-booker-prize-novels/">the ones I made last year</a>, which means I'd have to read a lot more to cover the short list, and I'm feeling burned out on this kind of book. Plus a lot of what I've read from the short list has been surprisingly sucky.</p>
<p>And the remaining unread short list books just don't appeal to me very much. I read and liked <em>Wolf Hall,</em>&nbsp;and while a sequel to that book would surely involve plenty of Anne Boleyn badassery, I feel like I got the idea the first go-round with Mantel. I think I'd rather spend that time on the new season of <em>Downton Abbey</em>. Will Self's prose drives me completely bonkers, so <em>Umbrella</em>&nbsp;is a no-go (experimental work like that is sufficiently hard for me to follow that the effect becomes impressionistic, which is fine in some media but not when you enjoy reading for plot). And that leaves me with <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Swimming-Home-A-Novel-ebook/dp/B00992OLN2/ref=tmm_kin_title_0?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1349730794&amp;sr=8-1">Swimming Home</a>, which looks fine, but doesn't seem all *that* compelling (another book about depression! great).</p>
<p>Besides, it's October. I usually like to spend this month reading ghost stories. As it stands, I have a number of pending genre obligations: <em>Cloud Atlas</em>&nbsp;for sci-fi book club A, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Twelve-Book-Passage-Trilogy-ebook/dp/B007GBTBMY/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1349749331&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+twelve">the sequel to The Passage</a>&nbsp;for seasonal spookiness, and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Fractal-Prince-ebook/dp/B007NJPRRM/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1349749375&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=fractal+prince">the sequel to The Quantum Thief</a> for general mind-bending awesomeness.</p>
<p>But enough excuses. I did make it through a bunch of Man Booker nominated novels, and I enjoyed several of them. I've also found that I enjoy writing about books -- it's nice to know that you'll have that exercise waiting for you as you read. It seems to focus my thinking and makes me more attentive to what's going on. So, <a class="reference external" href="/2011/10/04/the-man-booker-prize-novels/">like last year</a>, here are some impressions of the books that I did manage to get to. I'll list them in the order in which I tackled them, and link each title to the longer review I wrote on Goodreads (something I've gotten into the habit of doing).</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/381251826">Skios</a> - Very light, very fun. A farce about mistaken identity set in a Davos/TED/Aspen Ides-y kind of context where rich people are seeking new insights and doing various other foolish things. There seems to be a sense that this nomination was to recognize Michael Frayn's body of work rather than the specific novel, which makes sense. This is one of the few books on the list that I think I'm likely to recommend to others (and have already, with success, in fact). But that's mostly because it's light enough that I can be sure I won't be traumatizing the reader.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/381251965">Narcopolis</a> - A book about addiction set in the dying Bombay opium subculture in the late seventies. Very, very good. My favorite of the short list entries, and the short list entry that I hope wins it all.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/381252044">The Teleportation Accident</a> - Probably my favorite book from the whole long list. A bit of a mess, and hard to describe. But striking, and with a really entertainingly bleak sense of humor. The hero is a shallow, foolish narcissist -- but he's still our hero, he's not there to antagonize you. I really liked it.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/405333188">The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry</a> - A tear-jerker, and what I understand to be a very conventionally Booker Prize-y book, but pretty darn good. I enjoyed it quite a bit.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/421045875">Communion Town</a> - The most bizarre inclusion on the list. A collection of short stories from a young writer, and one that betrays what struck me as a characteristically immature male sense of drama. Which is fine -- I write this as a guy who spent most of his free time this weekend building a supervillain halloween costume -- but it's unusual for a Booker entrant. Mostly the stories didn't work for me, but one or two were pretty good. There's an individual breakdown at the link, if you're intrigued and want a suggestion about where to start.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/427120739">Garden of Evening Mists</a> - Can a work be orientalist if it's written by an Asian? I say yes: in this case, it's a book written by a Malaysian that clumsily fetishizes various aspects of Japanese culture. I thought it was jumbled, cliched garbage, but judging by the Goodreads reviews I seem to be in the minority. Still, I really thought this was abysmally bad. Other reasonable people have read it and come to much milder conclusions (though the consensus seems to be that it's at least a bit boring).</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/412163757">The Lighthouse</a> - Not bad, but not destined to be a favorite. The protagonist has been permanently damaged by his mother's abandonment, but his resulting weirdness and childishness seemed a bit unbelievable to me. Not that he shouldn't be weird and childish! Just not in this way. Nicely written, though.</li>
</ul>
<p>And I think that's it! Now for some time-travel, vampires and post-singularity surrealism.</p>

<p>You should all run out of your houses, right now, and get on road bikes. Take them to the country. Trust me, it will be great.</p>
<p>Charles arranged for me and some other friends to do exactly that last weekend, and I think I'm hooked. Most of you already understand that I approach city biking with the kind of inflexible zeal most often associated with religious pilgrims or genocidal tyrants. But this kind of biking -- <em>cycling</em>, really, as people like the one I am becoming find themselves insisting on calling it -- it's something else entirely.</p>
<p>Charles has an in with a bike shop guy that allowed us to rent Madone 5.2's. These are very fancy bikes, built of little more than ashes, glue and less metal than you have in your coin jar. As you can imagine, they are very, very fast. Getting onto one, I immediately understood the profound absurdity of &quot;intelligent design&quot; in a new way. Had we been intelligently designed, surely this is how our muscles and tendons would have been deployed: stretched onto a frame that can outrun a deer, and more than a few racehorses.</p>
<p>It's easy to develop a taste for this sense of power, to seek that Frankensteinian reconfiguration. And yes, you will find that you've become an abomination: the villagers will never do anything but recoil at the sight of your spandex and energy bars. But you won't care anymore, because you will be a very fast abomination.</p>
<p>On a weekend like last one -- wow. What better way to be outside? Each pedal stroke was a moon-leap across dozens of yards of bean plants fading to yellow; violet flowers climbing up dried cornstalks; cows wallowing beside me and hawks coasting on thermals above me. I love autumn, but I didn't think I'd ever be able to capture the (probably illusory) intensity of the childhood memories of hay mazes and cider and indian corn that define its mental timbre. Consuming that landscape at speed, though -- that just about does the trick.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>I've mostly observed this phenomenon through the lens of forward-looking nonprofits in my professional space (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jywarren/public-lab-diy-spectrometry-kit">Public Lab</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1368665357/a-one-year-student-reporting-lab-within-homicide-w">Homicide Watch</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/228865951/transit-app-for-ios-6-and-beyond">Open Plans</a>); the early wave of developing world microfinance efforts exemplified by <a class="reference external" href="http://kiva.org">Kiva</a>; and the many game-related Kickstarter efforts that <a class="reference external" href="http://penny-arcade.com">Penny Arcade</a> writes about.</p>
<p>The words &quot;finance&quot;, &quot;lending&quot; and &quot;investing&quot; tend to get applied to these platforms, but that's obviously wrong. For both legal and practical reasons, the returns are always modest: you're either overpaying for a service, or for some digital or promotional knick-knacks, or the returns can only be reinvested in the service.</p>
<p>Thanks to the cynically-named <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jumpstart_Our_Business_Startups_Act">JOBS Act</a>, many of the relevant legal restrictions are going to disappear. But is there any reason to believe that practical considerations will? People are overpaying because they want to. It's not just about making sure that a particular thing happens -- look at the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/doublefine/double-fine-adventure">DoubleFine Kickstarter</a>, which has now collected more than <em>eight times</em> the budget its creators say it requires (there are plenty of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jywarren/public-lab-diy-spectrometry-kit">other</a> <a class="reference external" href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/659943965/planetary-annihilation-a-next-generation-rts">examples</a>, too). It reminds me of all the talk at the DNC about Republican defense spending proposals that vastly exceed the Pentagon's own statements about their needs.</p>
<p>These expenditures are about spending money not just because we want what it will buy us, but because we wish to promote the values associated with this <em>kind</em> of use. It's a subsidy to a particular class of thing and, perhaps just as importantly, an act of self-expression on the part of the funder. This latter aspect is deeply entangled with our human appetite for narrative: crowdfunders appear to value the consumption experience of (for example) picking out the village where a new well will be drilled over the knowledge of funding a venture that issues quarterly reports on the total number of wells it drilled. You can see this clearly in the emphasis on video storytelling on Kickstarter, or the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/09/business/global/09kiva.html">upset</a> that erupted when it became clear that Kiva aggregates funds since (gasp) money is fungible. If we cannot cast the act of funding into a meaningful narrative, it becomes much less satisfying.</p>
<p>For the types of projects that are most emblematic of this movement, it seems unlikely that the possibility of positive returns will attract many marginal investors. Rather, returns will attract a different <em>kind</em> of investor -- and probably a different kind of project. After all, the kinds of projects that currently succeed at attracting funding will have no reason to put equity on the menu when a well-produced video presentation can suffice. Sure, the possibility of actual returns can presumably matter for investors for whom altruism isn't the sole motivator. But there are <a class="reference external" href="http://advisorshares.com/fund/give">existing vehicles</a> for that kind of investing that come with a proper layer of regulation and diligence. I worry that we'll soon see projects that promise to satisfy our values, but which offer promised returns as a substitute for an established track record (I expect many of these to come out of Silicon Valley).</p>
<p>There's a huge disconnect between people who support the JOBS act because they are inspired by Kickstarter and those who are worried about hedge funds bilking seniors. I've got friends with strongly-held opinions on both sides of this; I have to admit that I don't understand the dynamics well enough to know where I come down. I will say that slowly expanding the SEC compliance burden is the <em>only</em> realistic mechanism I see for leveling the transparency playing field between corporations and consumers -- from that perspective, JOBS is tremendously disappointing.</p>
<p>But I suppose I'm generally heartened by Kickstarterism. It's obviously not a rational way to allocate resources. To a large extent, it's counting on investors to optimistically fill in the blanks about games and causes and projects, and many of the results will inevitably disappoint. You know how much less excited you feel flipping through movies in iTunes versus when you saw their trailers in the theater? It's like that. There is money to be made by charging your entry fee on the early side of that declining enthusiasm function.</p>
<p>Still, overpaying talented people and trusting them to make something great is a model that has, at times, produced some pretty wonderful things. At some point we mostly gave that up: efficiencies were sought, and the patronage model was abandoned in favor of a coordinating layer of fund managers and NGO executives and the like. As with any occupation whose practitioners take their duties seriously, expertise and rationality-esteeming professional norms tended to accumulate at that layer, and consequently funds were aggregated and disbursed on a (supposedly) dispassionate basis.</p>
<p>But now, thanks to the internet, we can cut out those irritatingly Spock-like middle-men. In a world of scarce resources, it's hard to wholeheartedly defend this return to romanticism. But those middle-men were only human themselves, after all (honestly, who were they kidding?). There are worse ideas than octupling DoubleFine's budget and then waiting to see what happens -- as long as we're not conning seniors into spending their IRAs to do so.</p>

<p>I'd heard the arguments, but for some reason they hadn't sunk in. Pricing goods based on the buyer's means isn't too dissimilar to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.autoblog.com/2010/08/13/swedish-man-may-pay-largest-speeding-fine-ever/">the Swiss policy of ticketing drivers for amounts that go up with their incomes</a>. In most markets, it seems likely that this will amount to a cross-subsidization from rich purchasers to poor -- a progressive transfer. In the past I might have complained about this because the sorting mechanism used to distinguish between the rich and poor was basically to make the poor jump through a ton of hoops: weird store hours, clipping coupons, and otherwise imposing what amounted to a tax on their time (which they were willing to pay because their time was worth less than that of the wealthy). This seemed pointlessly wasteful and inhumane. I think that's the part that really bugged me.</p>
<p>But of course the stores don't have any particular desire to make you clip coupons. They just want to be able to effectively price discriminate. I realized that the privacy-dissolving information technology that makes that possible should be viewed primarily as a benefit to the less wealthy: the beneficial price discrimination scheme can continue, but with fewer associated costs to filter out rich people who aspire to freeloading. If those least able to pay can be given a price break without any gross affronts to human dignity, I'm all for it.</p>
<p>Of course, there's still plenty of room for the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/05/17/AR2009051702053.html">unscrupulous to take advantage of the less fortunate</a>, and there remains a tendency to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.wired.com/business/2012/04/ff_klout/">want to give rich people free stuff to promote overall demand</a>. So don't consider this a blanket endorsement of businesses hunting customers based on inferred wealth.</p>
<p>But the broader loyalty-card behemoth now seems less objectionable to me. I don't expect to retain much privacy in the face of technology; and to the extent we try to impose restrictions, enforcement against firms seems like the way to go. Let's pass some relevant legislation, beef up the FTC's budget and call it a day.</p>

                    <p>Last night Walt escaped a plastic zip-tie handcuff by using electricity from a household socket to create an electrical arc that melted the plastic. Not to belabor this, but when you short out a household electrical socket, this is what it looks like:</p>
<p>There are sparks of hot metal that burst everywhere, and it only lasts for an instant because the circuit's breaker or fuse pops. It's also probably going to complicate things to be connected to a very well-grounded metal object like a radiator -- to say nothing of stripping the live wire <em>with your mouth, which is wet and much more conductive than skin</em>, producing a circuit that flows <em>directly through your heart</em> as it heads toward your earthed left arm.</p>
<p>In general, that's how household voltages can kill you: by overcoming the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.darwinawards.com/darwin/darwin1999-50.html">actually-pretty-high resistance of your skin and disrupting your cardiac function</a>. It takes a lot of juice before electricity starts killing you through other means (basically: by cooking you).</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you grant the implausibly-persistent arc welder effect (perhaps Vamonos Pest has a dangerously configured but simultaneously robust electrical system), the grounded radiator would presumably have allowed Walt to apply it against the part of the plastic ziptie that anchored him to the radiator, rather than producing an unnecessary (but dramatic) act of self-mortification.</p>
<p>So yeah: it's implausible that he would've survived the wire-stripping without serious injury. And even making some allowances for an unusual electrical system, Walt could've done something less painful.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> in comments it's been pointed out that Walt turned off the power while stripping the wires. I don't remember that at all, but that's probably just my own lousy memory. The stuff about the electrical arc still stands, though.</p>

This is the third year that <a class="reference external" href="http://konklone.com/">Eric</a> has arranged such an outing (though a last-minute injury kept him from going this year), and the first time that I've joined the proceedings. It was fun! The staff at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.skydiveorange.com/">Skydive Orange</a> were friendly and professional, and the whole process went very smoothly. And, though I <a class="reference external" href="http://instagram.com/p/OeM0n0PECT/">sort of joked about it</a>, the atmosphere really <em>did</em> remind me of <em>Drop Zone</em>, the great(?) Wesley Snipes <em>Point Break</em> knockoff.</p>
<p>(OT: having your male lead punch his love interest = really charming screenwriting, guys!)</p>
<p>I say this not because I saw Gary Busey kill anyone by forcing their parachute into high-voltage power lines (though obviously I didn't watch <em>every</em> jump), but because of the atmosphere. It was a big event weekend at Skydive Orange, apparently, with an extra plane and team competitions and beer-filled campfires in the evenings. Everyone seemed implausibly attractive, friendly, bohemian, and really, really happy. Skydiver parties must be pretty fun.</p>
<p>But of course as newbies (and ones who weren't camping out), that scene wasn't really available to us. Perhaps later jumps become about freedom and self-expression. For first-timers like myself, the experience is about introspection.</p>
<p>A few weeks back I found myself boozily explaining why I wanted to jump out of a plane. It was a statement about human progress, I said: a testament to our mastery over materials, physics and our own instincts. How many other species would ever pursue a recreational activity like this? How many subsequent generations, for that matter, will be able to waste the energies necessary to haul themselves up and down the atmosphere for a thrill? I was lucky to be born during an age when this strange, beautiful ritual was possible, and that struck me as a privilege I should embrace.</p>
<p>I still believe all of that, but the actual experience didn't tell me much about the fate of our species; it told me about myself. Specifically, about the kinds of fear that work on me. And I don't mean to flatter myself with the following: I don't think I'm a particularly brave person (quite the opposite, in fact). But this experience didn't trouble me. There was a sense of unreality about it. Nerves, sure. Necessary compartmentalization, certainly. And at the lip of the door there was that cliched moment of vertiginous terror as I looked down at the ground below and the miles of air between us.</p>
<p>But then I looked back up -- a field of view that was more &quot;window seat&quot; than &quot;imminent death&quot; -- and worried about arching my back, and whether I was causing any inconvenience to my instructor (an enormous Italian guy, now strapped to my back, who had complained at length about his car's failing catalytic converter as the plane ascended). And then I was tumbling; straightening; figuring out how to breathe; trying not to glance at my altimeter too much; and noticing the sluggishness of my arm as Mario guided it to the ripcord. Violence, satisfaction that the instant of greatest stress on the equipment had passed safely, and then a few still moments as Mario pointed out our shadow and gave a brief lecture on steering a parafoil. We slid to earth more smoothly than some slip-n-slide trips I've taken, and then it was over. Supposedly this took about six minutes; it felt like 90 seconds at most.</p>
<p>I had been told what to do, and I'd done it robotically, and it was fine. As I said, this wasn't physical bravery. I think such a thing exists, and is necessary for someone to become a great athlete or dancer or even just to photograph well. This was more about embracing blankness, ignoring anxiety by focusing on the task at hand. It reminded me of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.zunta.org/blog/archives/2006/05/14/ive_got_laser_e/">my LASIK surgery</a> more than anything else.</p>
<p>What was interesting was the fear that persisted outside the blankness: the worry over disappointing my instructor, or insulting him through second-guessing, or committing a dangerous faux pas by standing in the wrong place as people packed their chutes in the hangar. I think I understand better how a soldier can leap over the lip of a trench and into machinegun fire: it's because back in the trench there's a sergeant yelling at him, who would be <em>extremely disappointed</em> to see any hesitation. It would just be very awkward.</p>
<p>I'm sure it's different for everyone, but I think I know a little more about myself for having jumped. I'd recommend it to anyone, and encourage those who feel nervous to push through their fears. It's really not that bad. Leaning out of an airplane is infinitely easier than leaning in for a first kiss.</p>

                    <p>I haven't quite figured out what to make of App.net. On the one hand, <a class="reference external" href="http://prospect.org/article/cost-hashtag-revolution">I've been worried about the corporate nature of Twitter for a while</a> -- the service is an important utility, and <a class="reference external" href="/2011/03/13/buy-now-pay-later/">I dread the rents that are going to be slowly, irritatingly and indirectly extracted from all of us as the company gets serious about making money</a>. App.net wants to be distributed, open and transparently funded; those are exactly the qualities I'd like to see in a Twitter replacement.</p>
<p>Yet I'm conflicted: I remember a wave of excitement around <a class="reference external" href="http://identi.ca">Identi.ca</a> and XMPP that was motivated by many of the same concerns. People were talking about federating with Twitter, building something more like SMTP or Usenet. Some early adopters cross-posted between the two services, but Identi.ca never really went anywhere. I haven't followed the fortunes of the platform closely, but I see <a class="reference external" href="http://techland.time.com/2012/08/13/app-net-made-its-goal-but-can-it-make-it/">troublingly</a> <a class="reference external" href="http://www.quora.com/App-net/How-is-app-net-going-to-be-different-from-Identi-ca">few</a> people asking how App.net will be substantively different, and even fewer plausible answers.</p>
<p>Predictably, the valley types most excited about App.net are talking about its odds in terms of its technology and business model. This is understandable: these are things that can be controlled. It is both self-flattering and empowering to pretend that these are the most important inputs to the equation that will determine a technology project's fate. Nobody likes talking about overcoming network effects or path dependence. Certainly no one wants to talk about dumb luck, novelty, stylishness or the role that celebrities like Ashton Kutcher played in making Twitter a hit. Not unless Marco Arment counts as a Kutcher-equivalent, anyway.</p>
<p>I wish these guys success, but it does seem like, having watched David challenge Goliath and lose, they've decided to make the next David a new shirt and send him back into the fray. Well, fingers crossed.</p>
<p>What's a bit more interesting is the idea that all of this is part of a new trend. You can find pieces proposing that Svbtle, Medium, App.net and their ilk all represent some kind of noveau-social-web minimalist/anticorporate movement (unsurprisingly, BuzzFeed has <a class="reference external" href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/jwherrman/welcome-to-the-new-internet-heres-what-it-looks">the one I found most easily via Google</a>).</p>
<p>This is stupid. Refactoring software is not a process that stops. As I've said before, <a class="reference external" href="/2008/06/13/the-internet-comes-in-waves/">I think online disillusionment and reinvention is a cyclical phenomenon, but that the periods of these cycles are increasingly out of sync</a>. By way of example, it seems suspicious that this allegedly-new ad-eschewing, content-esteeming minimalist web publishing movement seemingly doesn't include Tumblr or Instapaper. Those services are a couple of years old though, you see. Not much use for a trend story! And the novelty that these latest sites offer is strikingly threadbare -- nobody's even mustering a story as compelling as the celebration of Tumblr's incredible &quot;like&quot; (and not unlike!) button innovation. What they offer is not being the current thing, but seemingly not much else.</p>
<p>Still, it may be true that something is happening. <a class="reference external" href="/2010/05/12/schadenfacebook/">The relative popularity of social networks is a dynamic system</a>, and no equilibrium in this space should be considered permanent. Sometimes I picture us as so many early-adopting wildebeests, wallowing in our watering hole, grazing and snorting and occasionally forming ranks against threats (SOPA, lions). But perhaps there is a ripple of unease growing: a sense that the grass is thinning, the seasons are changing, and we need to move, move, move. Knots will break away, tentatively and unsuccessfully at first, but at some point it will be like a bottle that's uncorked, and we'll all flow across the plain to whatever the next thing is.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="/2009/07/02/after-twitter/">I've talked about this before, too</a>. It seems inevitable.</p>
<p>All of which brings me to <a class="reference external" href="http://dashes.com/anil/2012/08/you-cant-start-the-revolution-from-the-country-club.html">Anil Dash's post on this moment, or movement, or whatever you want to call it</a>. Even apart from Dash's unusually informed perspective, it's well worth a read, and the impulses it represents are noble. I'm a bit more cynical: <a class="reference external" href="/2010/02/11/thoughts-on-buzz/">I think attracting early-adopting elites is an important part of a network's success</a>, and that exclusivity rarely hurts one's chances. It's not a pleasingly democratic perspective, but I don't see any reason why these services should be exempt from the dynamics that clubs, restaurants, bands and political movements seem to be subject to. In this case, though, I'm not sure that the type of elites App.net is attracting -- <a class="reference external" href="http://daltoncaldwell.com/a-response-to-brennan-novak">people who care about things like PuSH and Webfinger</a> -- will presage broader adoption by non-technical cultures.</p>

                    <p>Just a quick thought (Sunlight's about to head out to a company outing at Nationals Park), but <a class="reference external" href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2012/07/19/business_schools_need_ethics.html">via Matt</a>, this Luigi Zingales quote hit a chord:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the economist&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/milton-friedman/">Milton Friedman</a>&nbsp;famously said the one and only responsibility of business is to increase its profits, he added “so long as it stays within the rules of the game, which is to say, engages in open and free competition without deception or fraud.” That’s a very big caveat, and one that is not stressed nearly enough in our business schools.</p>
<p><em>Lobbying to secure a competitive advantage from the government certainly does not represent “open and free competition.”</em> Similarly, preying on customers’ addictions or cognitive limitations constitutes deception, if not outright fraud. Not to mention using clients’ confidential information for personal gain, manipulating a major interest-rate benchmark such as Libor, or selling financial products you know to be flawed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Emphasis mine. This has been an idea I've been noodling on for a while: that stigmatizing corporations' presence in DC -- whether through direct purchases of lobbying or involvement in trade groups -- might be a productive path for activists. &nbsp;By this I mean to distinguish the stigmatization of lobbying, lobbyists and specific instances of corruption or malign influence (which everyone already hates) from the stigmatization of <em>being here at all</em>.</p>
<p>There've been recent, <a class="reference external" href="http://articles.latimes.com/2011/apr/08/business/la-fi-target-gay-20110409">successful actions</a> in opposition to corporate involvement in politics, but at the moment there's no realistic legislative or judicial path to constraining their influence. &nbsp;Maybe I'm kidding myself, but &quot;stop gaming the system&quot; seems like a viably nonpartisan message.</p>
<p>Also relevant to this is the work of my colleague <a class="reference external" href="http://sunlightfoundation.com/people/ldrutman/">Lee Drutman</a>, whose <a class="reference external" href="http://www.leedrutman.com/dissertation.html">dissertation</a> makes a convincing argument that the appropriate time to intervene in these matters is&nbsp;<em>before</em> an industry decides to head to Washington (Lee shows that once an industry sets up shop in DC they tend to stick around, even as the presence of their concerns on the policymaking calendar diminish) -- though presumably there'd need to be efforts to disarm existing lobbies (Google &amp; co. aren't going to be willing to sit on their hands while the long-established IP and telecom lobbies make trouble for them).</p>
<p>Anyway, something to consider.</p>

                    <p>Like every other self-respecting fanboy, I was outraged by <a class="reference external" href="http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/cinema/2012/07/09/120709crci_cinema_lane">Anthony Lane's review of the new Spider-man movie</a>. But my reasons are idiosyncratic -- I don't care that he disdains geek culture (to each his own), and I don't care to defend my ilk against his charges of emotional immaturity (that's a fool's errand). No, I'm pissed because Lane tosses off an observation that I've been meaning to write up ever since it hit me during the drive to Ezra's bachelor party:</p>
<blockquote>
If you are a twenty-year-old male of unvarnished social aptitude, those movies will seem like much-loved classics that have eaten up half your lifetime. They beg to be interpreted anew, just as Shakespeare’s history plays should be freshly staged by every generation.</blockquote>
<p>I'm not in my twenties anymore (does that make this better or worse? probably worse). But he's right: I think the best analogy for understanding superhero reboots is new stagings of Shakespeare. Lane mentioned this dismissively, but he's more right than he realizes.</p>
<p>For a while I was confused on this point: why were these franchises being remade so quickly? Why did the plotlines (if not the spectacle) become unsatisfying as soon as the origin story was concluded? I left <em>X-Men: First Class</em>&nbsp;thinking the movie was a promising sign of these films evolving -- of the audience becoming conversant enough to dive into the non-origin plots that fascinated me through my childhood. <em>First Class</em> had a decent story, and more importantly it&nbsp;<em>felt</em>&nbsp;like a comic book story. Yet it wasn't an origin story -- well, not wholly. &nbsp;Given the now-consistent commercial success of tights-and-capes movies, maybe it wouldn't be too long before we got that Secret Wars or Infinity Gauntlet movie after all...</p>
<p>Now, though, I realize that this was stupid.&nbsp;In fact, the innovation of&nbsp;<em>X-Men: First Class</em>&nbsp;was its setting. Sure, they fudged things by picking some particularly venerable and/or long-lived mutants. But this was just an excuse to move the X-Men origin story into a &quot;Greatest Generation starts fighting the Cold War&quot; atmosphere. My favorite scene had Xavier and Magneto tweedily philosophizing in a Cambridge club.</p>
<p>This happens all the time with Shakespeare. Romeo and Juliet in 1950s Cuba. The Merchant of Venice with Christians in post-Saddam Baghdad. King Lear in space. Whatever. Or hell, just different stagings in roughly traditional time periods, with different actors, performances and directorial choices. These are perfectly fine reasons to revisit a work.</p>
<div class="docutils container">
Admittedly, the legal reasons that motivated Sony to make this latest Spider-man movie are not as good. And the movie that resulted is not that good, either -- I preferred it to Sam Raimi's films (his stuff is inescapably campy, which feels vaguely insulting), but it's inessential: it doesn't make many interesting choices other than giving Peter Parker a skateboard and Justin Bieber haircut (part of the coolification of Marvel's outcast protagonists -- a larger trend that coincides with the mainstreaming of geek culture, and one that I'm not happy about, <a class="reference external" href="/2012/04/26/sexism-is-a-problem-brogramming-is-not/">this sentiment</a> notwithstanding).</div>
<p>Of course, the reasons for new adaptations of Shakespeare are different from those motivating endless Hulk movies. If there's a spectrum of dramatic specificity, with <a class="reference external" href="http://moongadget.com/origins/myth.html">George Lucas deploying nebulous Jungian archetypes</a> at one end and, at the other, Prohibition-era gangsters talking about mercy droppething as the gentle rain, comic books sit somewhere in the middle. Exactly where is up for debate: how much of the experience's value lies in the canonical text (&quot;organic webshooters are an outrage!&quot;), and how much is in the archetypal gesture (&quot;yeah, Uncle Ben didn't say 'with great power...' but the theme was there&quot;)?</p>
<p>Although different adaptations <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare%27s_Romeo_%2B_Juliet">can</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0165929/">should</a> make different choices, my own sympathies tend to lie with the latter camp. The details of specific comic plotlines are satisfying to crazed obsessives like myself, but it's the broad themes -- myths set in the context of the modern world -- that make these franchises compelling. &nbsp;Even the comics themselves have realized that the characters, broadly understood, are the important thing. The <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retcon">retcon</a> has always been a necessary tool to scrape away peskily accreting continuity, letting creators once again show the smooth lines of their franchises' lovely archetypes. This process has recently managed to drop most of its shame and self-hatred, as the consolidation of universe-wide plot-planning at the publishers' executive level has allowed reboots to become well-branded <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Marvel">corporate</a> <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_52">events</a> rather than cringe-inducing disasters that individual writers cobble together from clones, Skrulls, secret robots, alternate dimensions and cosmic energy beings.</p>
<p>But although I think the correct dramatic approach is clear, it's hard to say how these efforts will actually evolve. There are commercial reasons for pushing audiences toward the specificity of costumes and theme songs and collectible Slurpee cups. I don't think Avi Arad earned a penny from <a class="reference external" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1706593/">Chronicle</a>, &nbsp;but it can certainly be understood as a stripped-down adaptation of any number of Marvel origin stories. I count that film's creative and commercial success as solid evidence for this being the most promising direction for such films: to continue to use superpowers as a way of telling stories about alienation, duty, agency and the limits of human identity. These are all excellent themes for the digital age, and mixing CGI with a spandex-heavy wardrobe department turns out to be a surprisingly good way to investigate them.</p>
<p>It's this thematic level &nbsp;where further explorations will pay off. I'll be personally happy to see deep-continuity stories that I remember from my childhood* translated to the screen. But the moviegoing public is never going to hit the back catalog for the education in Claremont and Morrison that they'd need to join me in giving a damn. Screenwriters tend to be geeks, and the movie industry tends to not understand how to adapt comics successfully, so I do expect these backstories to be mined out. But I don't think many of these adaptations will succeed. &nbsp;It's the myths that matter; their recitation through creative adaptation is what needs to become a tradition.</p>
<p>* I should probably note that my childhood comics budget was pretty meager, and so I absorbed a lot of the backstory through the efficient-but-bloodless medium of old issues of <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Official_Handbook_of_the_Marvel_Universe">Marvel Universe</a>. I'll admit that this might color my thinking a bit.</p>

                    <p>I've been working on an electronics project for *forever*, trying to get past some nasty linux wifi bugs and on to the exciting lasercutting/3D printing/web scraping stuff that actually attracted me to the idea (the hope is to make it a repeatable but customizable gift I can give). But to be honest, my willpower has been fading -- a body can only spend so much time in a given IRC channel, asking the same obscure and tricky questions, hoping someone will deign to answer them correctly.</p>
<p>So I took a break to make something a lot simpler. I don't want to give the whole backstory away -- it's going to be a gift, and the recipients might read this blog -- but the core functionality is as simple as turning a garden hose on and off via remote control. And hey, it worked on the first try!</p>
<p>(I probably won't actually follow through on the motion sensor part -- the audio is just me talking to Kriston, Kaylyn and my neighbor Paul, who was nice enough to lend me the use of his water spigot when I found out mine was cracked)</p>
<p>You can see most of the components below, if this third party Flickr note embedding thing is working. The wiring's all wrong in this photo, and it's missing a 12v regulator to power the remote system and the automotive relay that actually switches the 24v valve. But you can see the most exciting parts.</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/7482950154/"><img alt="it might not look like much, but this is one voltage regulator away from being a remote controlled sprinkler system" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8022/7482950154_5a2249547c.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: 500px;" /></a></p>
<p>The next steps are to arrange all this stuff in an appropriately-decorated Gladware container so that it can resist the elements and hopefully not light itself on fire: things get warm when the system's switched on, but I think that's got to be expected with a system this full of relays, and one that's shedding 12v through a voltage regulator (heatsinked and well within spec, though!). If anyone feels like replicating this project, here's the bill of materials and some approximate prices:</p>
<ul class="simple">

<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.allelectronics.com/make-a-store/item/SRLY-2/SOCKET-FOR-AUTOMOTIVE-RELAY/1.html">relay socket</a> (optional, $2)</li>

<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.radioshack.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2062600">12v voltage regulator</a> ($2, though that's a ripoff)</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.radioshack.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2102856">heatsink for voltage regulator</a> ($2, and ...less optional. Don't forget the thermal grease!)</li>
</ul>
<p>It's a pretty good and easy project -- if anyone's interested in replicating it, leave a comment and I can sketch out a wiring diagram. If you buy the relay socket you wouldn't even need to solder anything: wire nuts would work just fine (I used a couple, in fact). Well, okay, you'll need to figure out how to attach the voltage regulator, and that's probably best done with a soldering iron. You might be able to get away with crimping stuff and then taping it up, though.</p>

                    <p>Kash has guest-blogger Elie Mystal talking about the relative toothlessness of the recently-released Declaration of Internet Freedom; <a class="reference external" href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2012/07/03/declaration-of-internet-freedom-contemplates-no-rights-or-freedoms-worth-declaring/">it's worth a read</a>. She's speaking about <a class="reference external" href="http://www.internetdeclaration.org/freedom">this document</a>, hosted at internetdeclaration.org and signed by a bunch of lefty net organizations like Free Press and CDT. Almost infinitely unhelpfully, a bunch of libertarian/right-leaning net organizations released a response document that was <em>also</em>&nbsp;called the Declaration of Internet Freedom -- you can find it at <a class="reference external" href="http://declarationofinternetfreedom.org/">declarationofinternetfreedom.org</a>.</p>
<p>As my friend Tim Lee has pointed out, both of these documents are so broad and vague as to be more or less perfectly compatible with one another. But of course their supporters <a class="reference external" href="http://techliberation.com/2012/07/02/the-problem-with-the-declaration-of-internet-freedom-the-digital-bill-of-rights/">will never acknowledge this</a>, because behind the pabulum is a desire to attract the anti-SOPA campaign's politically naive but newly-engaged internet advocates behind one or another camp's tribal ideological banner. The declarations are as broadly agreeable as an Expression Of Approval Of Apple Pie so as to appeal to as many potential supporters as possible. But you can reasonably expect the camp behind Declaration A to eventually email their new list members about net neutrality, and the folks behind Declaration B to do the same about government efforts to regulate telecoms.</p>
<p>These efforts should be understood as part of a larger race to grab leadership of what looks like a temptingly huge and ideologically-uncommitted political bloc. &nbsp;I think it's fair to view <a class="reference external" href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/rosiegray/the-pauls-new-crusade-internet-freedom">Rand and Ron Paul's new initiative</a> through this lens, and <a class="reference external" href="http://keepthewebopen.com/digital-bill-of-rights">Darrell Issa and Ron Wyden's Digital Bill of Rights</a>, and the <a class="reference external" href="http://internetdefenseleague.org/">Internet Defense League</a>.</p>
<p>I'm sure that no one undertaking these efforts is behaving wholly cynically. &nbsp;But it seems pretty obvious that a number of people think that they can get themselves crowned King of Reddit, then use the vast armies that come with that title to wrangle a bunch of small dollar campaign contributions or nonprofit membership dues or advocacy actions or invitations to speak at conferences. &nbsp;There's nothing particularly wrong with any of this -- though I <a class="reference external" href="/2012/04/16/cispa/">kind of suspect</a> that the people placing these bets are likely to find that they've badly misunderstood how the internet and political organizing actually work -- but it is at least a little slimy.</p>
<p>And it probably doesn't merit much policy attention. &nbsp;These documents are membership drives, not legislative programs. &nbsp;Though it is interesting to see the net bloc -- which (to the extent one can speak about it monolithically at all) seems to style itself as post-partisan -- begin to be <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/tjl/status/212210845739008000">inevitably absorbed into the world's existing ideological camps</a>.</p>

                    <p>Via <a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/timoreilly/status/217413877544132609">Tim O'Reilly's twitter feed</a> I see that <a class="reference external" href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304458604577488822667325882.html">Orbitz is experimenting with showing different results to Mac users than PC users</a>, based on the observation that Mac users tend to spend more money. The Orbitz folks claim that the price for a given hotel room is the same for everyone: they're just showing a different selection of options. Well, fine. Presumably other firms have just gone ahead and begun quoting a higher price to certain users based on their browser (one Australian firm recently decided to [STRIKEOUT:discourage IE7 use] grab some cheap PR by <a class="reference external" href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/13/kogan-hates-ie7-so-much-its-imposing-a-tax-on-all-shoppers-that-use-the-browser/">doing so as loudly as possible</a>). I've seen <a class="reference external" href="/2008/04/02/virgin-america-still-evil-but-now-defeatable/">suspicious pricing games</a> around online travel in the past.</p>
<p>My thoughtful economist friends will be quick to point out that price discrimination allows markets behave more efficiently, and in fact helps to keep prices down for those who are less able to pay. &nbsp;In a certain sense that all makes sense; and yes, my yuppie, Mac-owning ass probably <em>should</em>&nbsp;be squeezed for every dollar it's good for.</p>
<p>Still: it's irritating! And, when this process takes the more time-consuming form of, say, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/timothylee/2012/06/06/comcasts-obnoxious-price-discrimnation-strategy/">Tim's periodic haggling with Comcast</a>, it seems extremely inefficient. I can imagine solutions that free up Tim's time: perhaps <a class="reference external" href="http://www.fancyhands.com/">Fancy Hands</a> will begin offering a cheap &quot;Yell At Comcast&quot; subscription with a money-back guarantee. &nbsp;Similarly, I can simply start spoofing my browser's user agent when I shop online (probably not a bad idea in general -- you leak <a class="reference external" href="https://panopticlick.eff.org/">a surprisingly large amount of information</a> that way). But why should I have to throw money at a middleman for that service? Why should the technically useful information contained in a user agent string have to be deliberately destroyed?</p>
<p>It makes me wonder what Hayek would say about all of this. It's hard to imagine exactly what negative effects even an e-commerce behemoth like Amazon could cause were it to start monkeying with price signals in an effort to do a little social or behavioral engineering. It still strikes me as a generally bad idea, though -- and &nbsp;consistent with the idea of our markets (and every other societal system) growing ever more baroque, ever more filled with cruft, ever more ossified and inflexible. We filled up our tax code with this garbage; before long I suppose every retailer with a Google Analytics account will gin up their own microscopically small cross-subsidization scheme as well, as they aspire to make consumer behavior less about considered responses to pricing and more about aspects of the buyer's identity that aren't easily escaped.</p>
<p>This is perhaps a maximally gloomy interpretation of what amounts to a pretty minor incident in the evolution of personalized search. But what can I say, I'm feeling cranky.</p>

                    <p>Kriston wants me to believe that Sleigh Bells is good. To wit, he shares this video:</p>
<p>So! They've dropped the irritating <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipping_(audio)">audio clipping</a>, which <a class="reference external" href="/2010/05/14/sleigh-bells/">I found physically unpleasant</a>. But this is just as gimmicky. Have a look at the waveform:</p>
<p><img alt="sleigh bells waveform" class="center" src="/static/2012/05/24/sleigh_bells-20120524-233233.png" /></p>
<p>The Sleigh Bells audio has been compressed to hell and back. By way of comparison, here's the waveform captured from a Youtube of <em>Back In Black</em>, which we can hopefully agree is a not particularly sedate song (in order to be more than fair, I've tried to crop this to include both more time, and portions of the song that extend beyond the admittedly stuttery intro):</p>
<p><img alt="Back in Black" class="center" src="/static/2012/05/24/back_in_black-20120524-233416.png" /></p>
<p>Overcompression is standard operating procedure for recorded music these days. But it's also a cheap trick that makes things seem louder. That's fine for grabbing attention, but in the case of Sleigh Bells it's the second time they've made a play at the same gimmick -- and this is a far less daring move than the audacious/unpleasant clipping of the last LP.</p>
<p>I think the way to understand this is by way of analogy to food. There are certain reliable levers that chefs can lean on to stimulate our pathetic simian brains. More salt/more fat/more sweetness/more umami. Any of these will endow food with a greater valence. That's not a good or a bad thing, necessarily; it can be deployed artfully by skilled gastronomists, or it can be hammered home via a bag of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.fritolay.com/our-snacks/doritos-spicy-sweet-chili-chips.html">Sweet Chili Doritos</a> that's been crammed full of sodium, MSG and corn syrup solids.</p>
<p>Loudness is just the same. The louder it is, the more fervent it is; the more raucous the party, the more urgent the emotion, the more outrageous the rebellion. And Sleigh Bells is indisputably making their name by being the loudest bad around.</p>
<p>So I leave it to you: is Sleigh Bells a Ferran Adrià, or are they a Frito Lay? Tedious pop historians will adjudicate this, but based on the simplistic lyrics, repetitive hooks and increasingly well-worn playbook, I know where I'm placing my bet.</p>

                    <p><img alt="image1" class="alignright" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5446/7236838766_f7e30537f2_n.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 320px;" />I participated in Artomatic in 2009, making a hurried tech piece that ill-advisedly involved audience interaction, and which consequently spent most of the show broken. But the experience was a good one! For one thing, my project never caught fire. And for another, I learned some lessons about what makes a viable piece.</p>
<p>But mostly I just liked spending time at Artomatic. If you want to be a part of the show you have to volunteer for a few shifts -- I vividly remember sitting on a loading dock and reading about Dr. Hilarius as I spent eight hours directing fitful traffic to the parking garage. Being a part of the event provided me with a clear view of the operation and the people behind it. There are impressive strains of bohemianism, tenacity and mutual goodwill that make the whole huge structure of the thing possible. And I like that it's just for DC--there's no ambition, no pretension, just an insistence on pragmatism and (often cringe-inducingly) democratic ideals. I like it a lot.</p>
<p>The current installment of Artomatic opened on Friday, and though I'm not participating this time (no time; no ideas), I suspect I'll be making a number of trips to see what's on offer. Today was the first such foray. I only made it through two floors before closing time, but I probably wouldn't have made it through too many more anyway--the experience can be overwhelming.</p>
<p>I took a bunch of photos, but I have to admit I concentrated on the most absurd pieces (or those that reminded me of something else and which I wanted to share with friends). This isn't to say that there isn't anything good on offer (though it is safe to say that such pieces are in the minority). For instance, I enjoyed paintings by Bob Aldrich, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.juliabloom.net/juliabloom.net/Large_Sculptures.html">sculpture by Julia Bloom</a> and some <a class="reference external" href="http://districtdesignworks.com/home/index.html">CNC-fabricated furniture by Ryan McKibbin</a> (all of this was on on the seventh floor, if you're curious to seek it out).</p>
<p>But you don't want to see my crappy iphone photography of decent-to-good art, do you? What would be the point? Much more interesting are the pieces that seem strange or inexplicable. Am I a jerk for thinking so? Probably. I don't just mean to gape, though, or to belittle the artists. In part, I just like being reminded how different people are; how much their tastes and interests vary from my own; and how courageous so many of them are in exposing their idiosyncratic passions to the world. Say what you will about a crystal-covered painting of Oprah: it's a braver thing to display than the bloodless wood and reception bells I chose to exhibit.</p>
<p>Anyway, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/sets/72157629822458484/">here are some photos</a>. I'm sure I'll be adding to them soon.</p>

<p>But! I still think he's too skeptical about the prospects for widespread cord-cutting. &nbsp;Matt doesn't link to any figures, but, contra the headline, <a class="reference external" href="http://articles.businessinsider.com/2012-03-05/tech/31123221_1_pay-tv-cable-industry-cord">this chart</a> sure looks like it's showing a downward trend to me, albeit one that's noisy and surely confounded by other effects like slowed household formation. And there's <a class="reference external" href="http://allthingsd.com/20120105/where-did-nine-million-cable-subscribers-go/">some reason to think</a> that cord-cutting is still a nascent idea but one that, <a class="reference external" href="http://techliberation.com/2010/05/13/cord-cutting-continues-25-of-homes-now-wireless-only/">like abandoning landlines</a>, will catch on once people see their peers doing it without ruining their lives.</p>
<p>I'll add that my own experience doing without cable TV has been a positive one. Netflix reliably has stuff I want to watch; iTunes has delivered season passes to the <a class="reference external" href="http://io9.com/5876238/first-scene-from-avatar-the-legend-of-korra-shows-our-heroine-kicking-butt/gallery/1">new Avatar series</a> and Deadliest Catch that, while not a steal, are reasonably priced and, aside from the slightly delayed delivery and regrettable absence of Cap'n Phil (<a class="reference external" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=seagull&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;prmd=imvns&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;ei=r1KtT-CKFsLL0QHxmbS3DA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=mode_link&amp;ct=mode&amp;cd=2&amp;ved=0CBUQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=751">RIP</a>), totally acceptable. Live sports remain the real problem, of course. A few years ago, when the leagues did their business with broadcast networks that made their money on ads, this would've been totally solvable. Recent years' shenanigans with cable networks and proprietary distribution channels make this situation seem a bit less hopeful, but I'm optimistic that growing consumer impatience will eventually spur lawmakers to get involved with these legally-granted monopolies and deliver the digital bread and circuses that the public rightly demands.</p>
<p>Finally, Matt makes a technical point:</p>
<blockquote>
The problem for people who do want to watch all their TV over the internet is that to provide enough video content to everyone for that to be the standard way of doing things, you'd need much more broadband capacity. And we could build much more broadband capacity, but people would have to want to buy it. And at the moment, it seems like people don't really want to. Of course they&nbsp;<em>would</em>&nbsp;want to if cable television stopped existing, but all the infrastructure is already there. Now maybe aggregate population preferences will change over time. There's certainly some evidence that they're shifting a bit. But hard as it is for web junkies to remember, lots of people seem perfectly happy checking Facebook on their phone.</blockquote>
<p>First: I do think preferences will change over time. Cohort replacement!</p>
<p>Second, there's more capacity than might be apparent. The basic problem Matt's gesturing toward is broadcast versus video-on-demand (VOD). Multiple viewers can watch a single, synchronous stream of programming -- the same amount of bandwidth is needed regardless of how many people tune in. For on-demand stuff, everyone typically needs their own stream of data, making scalability a problem.</p>
<p>But of course most cable providers now offer substantial VOD services without choking their systems. I <em>believe</em>&nbsp;that AT&amp;T's U-verse system actually delivers everything in a VOD-like manner, though it's a bit hard to suss out the details. Regardless, one can easily imagine various solutions to this that take advantage of consumer predictability and caching technology. &nbsp;When you tune into&nbsp;<em>The Voice</em>, you could be offered the option of watching immediately for a surcharge or waiting X minutes to hop on the next <em>every-X-minutes</em> scheduled broadcast stream. Or&nbsp;your DVR could download the week's ads every Sunday night, then stagger their distribution between pre-roll and mid-broadcast placement in order to line you up with the next broadcast stream. One can even imagine dynamic schemes where content is priced according to current network conditions and your subnet-neighbors' current viewing habits. That would probably be economically fascinating enough that even Matt would be in favor.</p>

<blockquote>
Another issue raised in comments is the idea that a &quot;fair use&quot; by definition can't be commercial. I was glad to see someone raise this point if only because I do wish we could re-inject more life into the commerce/non-commercial distinction for broad copyright purposes. But my goal would be to use the distinction to raise the scope of tolerated non-commercial copying, not to narrow the scope of allowable commerce. Commerce is a legitimate and important human undertaking, and the goal of copyright law should be to facilitate useful commerce. That includes preventing large-scale commercialized digital copying, but I think also means allowing commercialized sampling, quoting, and repurposing of existing material.</blockquote>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2012/05/02/defending-the-big-tent-open-data-inclusivity-and-activism/">I made a somewhat similar point recently when talking about open data</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
[...] I think it’s flatly wrong to consider private actors’ interest in public data to be uniformly problematic. We should be clear: we won’t tolerate those interests’ occasional attempts to lock public data into exclusive monopolies. I think our community has done a&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.globalintegrity.org/blog/bank-responds-to-google-maps-deal">pretty good job lately</a>&nbsp;of identifying such situations and stopping them, and of course people like&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://boingboing.net/2012/03/19/liberating-americas-secret.html">Carl Malamud</a>&nbsp;have been doing important work on this question since well before most of us ever heard of &quot;open data.&quot; But if commercial activity is enabled by data, that’s all to the good—the great thing about digital information is that scarcity doesn’t have to be a concern. Google Maps’ uses of Census TIGER data, for instance, is proprietary, motivated by profit, and unquestionably a huge boon to human welfare. And&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.census.gov/geo/www/tiger/">the source data remains free for anyone else to use</a>! Cutting off those kinds of uses with noncommercial licensing would be nothing more than a destructive act of pique.</blockquote>
<p>This really came into focus for me when I was in Berlin for a conference run by the good folks at the <a class="reference external" href="http://okfn.org/">Open Knowledge Foundation</a>. I admit that before I stopped to think about it, I never found noncommercial licenses that problematic, and would casually throw them on material I produced on the web. That way our vaguely-defined communal web society (so pure and untainted by the profit motive!) could use it, but &quot;they&quot; wouldn't benefit from my hard(?) work tagging photos on Flickr. Honestly, this was dumb. I was never going to put in the time to try to make money off of those photos. If someone else could do the work to make them useful to others, why begrudge them that opportunity?*</p>
<p>I wouldn't go as far as Matt about the goal of copyright law being to facilitate commerce (this formulation seems to ignore the kind of deadweight losses that Matt's writing about IP is usually about). &nbsp;But he's right about commerce being a &quot;legitimate and important human undertaking.&quot; &nbsp;Certainly the private sector is capable of excesses, but it's also an incredible tool for identifying and satisfying human needs. We shouldn't resent it out of some sort of ideological tribalism -- particularly when we're discussing digital goods, where things are rarely zero-sum and where (with apologies to Julian and Kash) the negative externalities (Mark Zuckerberg can infer your sexual preferences) are less severe than those found in the physical world (the chemical plant next door means your baby was born with fins).</p>
<p>* I should acknowledge that this is just a for-instance. As there's very occasionally a market demand for unflattering photos of some of my friends by ideological press outlets, I've elected to keep somewhat restrictive licensing on my meager photographic output. But in less problematic cases -- the code I put on GitHub, for instance -- I've moved to open, nonviral licensing.</p>

I have known meathead programmers who treat women as respected equals, and I have known cartoonishly Aspergery nebbishes whose jaw-droppingly sexist utterances would send any sane woman sprinting from the hackerspace. In between, I have seen a number of ordinary young men -- guys whose personal style and mannerisms would be unobjectionable to the median Beach House listener -- give presentations at conferences that alienated, angered or hurt the women in their community.</p>
<p>I'll submit that the project of making women feel comfortable in this industry -- a project that is very worthwhile -- has basically nothing to do with whether that industry's men work out, wear their baseball caps backward, or listen to shitty music.</p>
<p>Believe me, I don't like it when douchebags start showing up at my favorite hangouts, either. But it's important to distinguish our &nbsp;insular cultural grudges (which can be fun!) from our insistence on equality and fairness (which is actually important).</p>
<p>I think everyone should learn to write code. That includes the mouthbreathers, if they behave themselves.</p>

                    <p>Since I have some visitors, let me note that, despite my default position of skepticism, I don't think technology's done reshaping our world -- not by any means.</p>
<p>True, across a range of disciplines, there is cause for gloom.&nbsp;Some technologies -- batteries, getting into orbit -- sure <em>look</em>&nbsp;like they're bumping up against immutable physical limits (fingers crossed that we invent flying saucers; get on it, physicists!). Others, like the speed of your home broadband connection, are hitting commercial or regulatory problems sufficiently imposing that the benefits to overcoming them don't seem worth the cost. In other cases it's a mix: growing (and arguably justified!) bureaucracy&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;depletion of low-hanging fruit <a class="reference external" href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewherper/2011/06/27/the-decline-of-pharmaceutical-researchmeasured-in-new-drugs-and-dollars/">combine to slow progress&nbsp;to a crawl</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Future societal changes related to information technology seem likely to be more about growing adoption (&quot;even poor people have smartphones&quot;; &quot;wow, they've applied the carsharing model to&nbsp;<em>that</em>?&quot;) than the deployment of new innovations (&quot;he probably misses his&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6W4CCU9M4">old glasses</a>&quot;) -- though note that this isn't actually much of a problem for human welfare if you exclude tech journalists from your analysis.</p>
<p>Certainly some of these points of stagnation will be overcome with unanticipated developments. &nbsp;And obviously I'm just as in the dark as anyone about what those innovations will be.</p>
<p>But I can guess at a couple of things -- there are a few obvious bright spots. Supplementing education, for instance: I don't know if something like Khan Academy can serve as a kind of pedagogical prosthesis, allowing a mediocre teacher to borrow some of the skills of a great one. But it at least seems plausible, and is something that's being actively figured out.</p>
<p>Maybe more whiz-bang-ishly, I'm <em>very</em>&nbsp;excited about self-driving cars. Again, this is something that's actively being worked on: not just by Google but by a number of automakers. And, somewhat shockingly, the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/250179/nevada_approves_selfdriving_cars_after_google_lobbying_push.html">early word</a> on the regulatory state's ability to adapt is not <em>completely</em>&nbsp;depressing (though I expect it to get more so).&nbsp;I realize that this might seem like a somewhat trivial technology -- certainly when I first pondered the idea I didn't understand it to be much more than a better cruise control. &nbsp;But if you haven't, let me strongly encourage you to read Tim Lee's <a class="reference external" href="http://arstechnica.com/old/content/2008/09/future-of-driving-part-1.ars">three</a> <a class="reference external" href="http://arstechnica.com/old/content/2008/10/future-of-driving-part-2.ars">part</a> <a class="reference external" href="http://arstechnica.com/old/content/2008/11/future-of-driving-part-3.ars">series</a> on what this all could mean. It's not just about playing George Jetson and watching a movie during your next road trip. Self-driving cars would free a huge amount of human capital and dramatically reduce the number of cars and supporting infrastructure that we would collectively require. &nbsp;This has implications for our cities, our environment -- even the experience of being a child or parent (a relationship that, Matt is fond of pointing out, involves a hell of a lot of chauffeur service).</p>
<p>I genuinely think this will arrive in my lifetime (pre-dotage, even! though I think <a class="reference external" href="http://timothyblee.com/2010/11/08/a-bet/">this</a> remains an excitingly uncertain bet), and that it'll be a very big deal. &nbsp;It's worth noting that it'll also be yet one more thing fueling inequality: no more truckers, no more cabbies, fewer construction and auto workers. &nbsp;This is why I think learning <a class="reference external" href="/2012/04/17/post-scarcity/">how to make peace with our new robot overlords</a>&nbsp;is so important.</p>

                    <p>Let me start by saying that I really like Alexis Madrigal's work. He's got an eye for what's new and interesting and he writes pieces that are fluid and thoughtful.</p>
<p>But it's hard for me to read <a class="reference external" href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/12/04/the-jig-is-up-time-to-get-past-facebook-and-invent-a-new-future/256046/">this</a> and not despair. He comes <em>so close</em> to the realization that a guy as smart as him ought to have already had:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I can take a photo of a check and deposit it in my bank account, then turn around and find a new book through a Twitter link and buy it, all while being surveilled by a drone in Afghanistan and keeping track of how many steps I've walked.</p>
<p>The question is, as it has always been: now what?</p>
<p>Decades ago, the answer was, &quot;Build the Internet.&quot; Fifteen years ago, it was, &quot;Build the Web.&quot; Five years ago, the answers were probably, &quot;Build the social network&quot; or &quot;Build the mobile web.&quot; And it was in around that time in 2007 that Facebook emerged as the social networking leader, Twitter got known at SXSW, and we saw the release of the first Kindle and the first iPhone. There are a lot of new phones that look like the iPhone, plenty of e-readers that look like the Kindle, and countless social networks that look like Facebook and Twitter. In other words, we can cross that task off the list. It happened.</p>
<p>What we've seen since have been evolutionary improvements on the patterns established five years ago. The platforms that have seemed hot in the last couple of years -- Tumblr, Instagram, Pinterest -- add a bit of design or mobile intelligence to the established ways of thinking. The most exciting thing to come along in the consumer space between then and now is the iPad. But despite its glorious screen and extended battery life, it really is a scaled up iPhone that offers developers more space and speed to do roughly the same things they were doing before. The top apps for the iPad look startlingly similar the top apps for the iPhone: casual games, social networking, light productivity software.</p>
<p>For at least five years, we've been working with the same operating logic in the consumer technology game. This is what it looks like:</p>
<p>There will be ratings and photos and a network of friends imported, borrowed, or stolen from one of the big social networks. There will be an emphasis on connections between people, things, and places. That is to say, the software you run on your phone will try to get you to help it understand what and who you care about out there in the world. Because all that stuff can be transmuted into valuable information for advertisers.</p>
<p>That paradigm has run its course. It's not quite over yet, but I think we're into the mobile social fin de siècle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is just an excerpt. But the whole post is pervaded by a sorrowful impatience. A sense that that all that stuff that came before was <em>okay</em>, but not quite what we were looking for, you know? It's time for something new; something that, finally, will <em>really</em> change everything.</p>
<p>A pessimist might be worried. It's <em>almost</em> as if these endless cresting waves of technical fads are never actually going to carry us beyond the threshold that we perceive but can't name -- that we won't achieve transcendence through apps, that HTML5 won't remake human nature, that meaning might be more than one more MacWorld away. That technology is only important to the extent that it lets us do things we otherwise couldn't, and that a maniacal focus on tech as a movement, beat or industry will necessarily rob it of all its vitality, leaving the obsessive observer of valuations and launches on a joyless and masturbatory trudge through the sucked-dry bones of a topic that is only worth considering in its relation to a vastly richer, larger and more important cultural landscape.</p>
<p>I mean... it could be, right? Should we at least consider the possibility?</p>
<p>Actually, no, nevermind -- whew! -- that's all wrong. Check it out, the new iPhone 5 could be AMAZING:</p>
<blockquote>
[...] I think we all better hope that the iPhone 5 has some crazy surprises in store for us later this year. Maybe it's a user interface thing. Maybe it's a whole line of hardware extensions that allow for new kinds of inputs and outputs. I'm not sure what it is, but a decently radical shift in hardware capabilities on par with phone--&gt;smartphone or smartphone--&gt;iPhone would be enough, I think, to provide a springboard for some new ideas.</blockquote>
<p>Also, lightbulbs:</p>
<blockquote>
I have some [ideas] of my own, too. The cost of a lumen of light is dropping precipitously; there must be more things than lightbulbs that can benefit from that.</blockquote>
<p>That could be a thing, right? Lightbulbs as a platform, man. You go email the alumni list for a technical cofounder, I'll start working on the pitch deck. Do you think we should do it Ignite style or aim for more of a TEDx thing?</p>
<p>And don't forget Big Data. No, we still have no idea what problems we actually want to solve with it (all human disease? let's discuss in Campfire). But check it out, I found an amazing Stack Overflow thread about building a software RAID array out of EBSes. Once we spend a couple hundred bucks on an Elastic MapReduce run, how could we <em>not</em> have fundamentally improved our civilization? It's inconceivable!</p>
<blockquote>
There's vast amounts of databases, real-world data, and video that remains unindexed. Who knows what a billion Chinese Internet users will come up with? The quantified self is just getting going on its path to the programmable self. And no one has figured out how to do augmented reality in an elegant way.</blockquote>
<p>Anyway, thank goodness. <a class="reference external" href="/2012/03/14/technology-and-humility/">For a second there I was worried</a>.</p>

<p>It's funny: I tend to be skeptical about expansive visions of technological transformation. Our human impulses keep the reality that actually unfolds quaintly venal and simple-minded. Douglas Adams remains my favorite guide to the future. But I do think this could be a real problem.</p>
<p>Americans' physical needs have been pretty well met for a while now. It sure looks like more and more people are hitting a ceiling on the marginal utility of their dollars. And there haven't been any hugely popular new product categories for decades -- no flying cars, no medical breakthroughs that add decades to life. Just steadily better and cheaper consumer goods, and the debut of various useful but negligibly expensive information technology gadgets. I'm starting to actually believe I could outlive scarcity (in America, anyway).</p>
<p>I am much less gloomy about what we do after that point than Mr. Staniford seems to be. Robots might take a lot of work away from us, but I can't imagine a future where they take all the <em>meaningful</em> work. Ever been in a nursing home? A mental health facility? An underperforming school? If we really find ourselves with more resources than we know what to do with, applying them toward minimizing human suffering strikes me as a pretty worthwhile project, and one that could occupy an almost arbitrarily large number of people.</p>
<p>Or we could just have everyone spend their days carving elaborate friezes onto our public infrastructure. Hell, let's build some new pyramids! I don't know! But I am increasingly suspicious that how we redirect our surplus resources will be the central moral and political problem of the next few generations. No joke: this is why I'm trying to convince Yglesias to write his next book about the economics of Star Trek. Barring some deeply unsettling discoveries about physics, we're not going to see replicators or holodecks arrive anytime soon. But it's probably the most widely-known fictional work that even occasionally addresses this problem, which makes it seem like as good a framing device as any.</p>
<p>Or, perhaps more plausibly, we might have an ecological or epidemiological catastrophe that causes the collapse of global civilization. In which case we can probably just ignore these questions and enjoy the time we have left.</p>

                    <p>A <a class="reference external" href="https://cyberspying.eff.org/">campaign opposing the legislation</a> launched about three minutes ago -- Sunlight is among the signatories. &nbsp;It's going to be interesting to see how this works out:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Will CISPA come to fully carry the &quot;new SOPA&quot; framing that advocates (intoxicated by the overwhelming success of that earlier campaign) are going to be unable to resist suggesting?</li>
<li>Will that be productive, or will the net bloc feel that it's being manipulated and disengage?</li>
<li>Can organization of this constituency succeed without the support of the net's commercial entities? &nbsp;By most accounts they're indifferent to CISPA in a way they weren't with SOPA.</li>
</ul>
<p>All I can tell you is that people who who have spent years promising that the internet will transform our democracy* are <em>very</em>&nbsp;excited about how the SOPA/PIPA fight went down -- and with good reason! It was a thunderous victory by all accounts. The people who have been quietly toiling in this arena feel that they might have discovered a new weapon, and the temptation to try to use it soon will no doubt prove&nbsp;irresistible.</p>
<p>Normally, trying to clone a successful campaign action is a recipe for disappointment. &nbsp;But it really is true that reflexive opposition to everything Congress tries to do to the internet is a pretty sound policy rule of thumb; there's an online constituency with vague political preferences but a strong sense of net territoriality and disillusionment with Washington; and the business communities who are most interested in mucking with the internet aren't really set up to run successful campaigns against an engaged public opposition (these guys are used to getting their way because there's basically no one paying attention on the other side).</p>
<p>So we'll see!</p>
<p>*&nbsp;in more inspiring ways than opening up a bunch of small donor money or boring, non-cutting edge (or just uninterestingly egalitarian) things like enabling constituent communication, I mean</p>

<p>With the internetty part of SXSW well behind me, it seems like a good time to talk a bit more about the state of our community (if it can be called such a thing) and its origin myths.</p>
<p>It <em>seems</em> as though disillusionment and cynicism are growing within our ranks. Alex Payne <a class="reference external" href="http://al3x.net/2012/03/06/tech-criticism.html">does a nice job</a> rounding up some examples. As noted here recently, it's difficult to separate this sense from the process of growing older (Alex is not much younger than me). Still, I perceive it to be a real shift. I think there are specific reasons for it, and that its arrival was inevitable.</p>
<p>It's an axiom of internet true-belief that things will get <em>faster</em>. Mostly, this is true. Moore's Law is habitually misstated, but even when the details are mangled the speaker's point often remains defensible. Digital technology really does get cheaper in a hurry, and this has real consequences for its reach and impact on our lives. Faith in this ceaseless acceleration reaches its apotheosis in the idea of the Singularity, an <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity#History_of_the_idea">long-nascent</a> idea popularized by Ray Kurzweil, which posits that technological change will reach a velocity beyond which meaningful predictions about human society are impossible to make. Many people guess that this will involve mind-uploading, but the point is really just that we won't be able to anticipate the true nature of the silicon godhead. Kurzweil was at SXSW, but I can assure you that he wasn't the only person in Austin hoping/expecting that his mind will live forever in a machine or otherwise achieve technological transcendence.</p>
<p>Many find this faith in technological acceleration to be cheering, but it's got some problems. Perhaps most importantly, it ignores the reality of diminishing marginal utility. Put simply: useful interventions tend to get less useful as you apply more of them to a problem. Digital technology can do a lot of things, and its declining cost means it will do more and more of them. But it's important to realize that many of the things it could do but didn't back when it was more expensive <em>weren't done because they weren't worth the expense</em>.</p>
<p>My toothbrush has a microprocessor in it; it's great, and it only cost me $50 or so. It times my brushing and it ramped up the strenuousness of its sonic ministrations when I first began using it. Two decades ago, no such toothbrush was available. Why? There are a number of possible explanations. Perhaps the technology didn't exist? No, that's not right, it certainly did. Perhaps the toothbrush makers of the past were less clever than the folks gathered in Austin? No -- that seems improbable, or at least egotistical. I think a better explanation is simply that, at the time, the advantages of a microprocessor-enabled toothbrush didn't justify the expense of building it. The expense diminished, so now we have them. But it's the costs that fell; the utility has remained static, and meager. This is strictly long-tail stuff.</p>
<p>Put another way: the most urgent uses for a technology will be addressed first. That's the beauty of markets. But a consequence is that, during a given technological milieu, engineers will generally find themselves working on tasks that increasingly seem trivial.</p>
<p>I don't think developers should be discouraged by this, but I suspect that many of them will be. That's too bad. There's no shame in doing honest work for honest pay. I've argued before that <a class="reference external" href="/2010/11/27/software-development-is-a-trade/">software development is a trade</a> comparable to carpentry. I still think that's about right. Building someone a home may not be &quot;innovative&quot;, but it's a necessary and important thing. There will always be meaningful work that needs to be done, and, if you pursue work that is especially difficult or neglected by the marketplace, even work that is novel and exciting.</p>
<p>For what it's worth, I don't think that ours is the first engineering discipline that's had to go through this process. You only have to look at the automobile-triumphalist designs of Corbusier to understand how easily the early returns to an invention can be incorrectly projected into the future (in many such cases we should be happy to have gotten away with disappointment rather than <a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNBr6de7TD4">outright disaster</a>). Similarly crazed optimism affected observers looking forward to a future full of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.neatorama.com/2011/01/23/thomas-edisons-1911-predictions-for-2011/">steel</a>, supersonic flight, <a class="reference external" href="http://radiographics.rsna.org/content/24/2/544.fullxray-mania-F3-large">radiography</a> and who knows how many other unhelpfully applied technologies.</p>
<p>Now, I shouldn't overstate all of this; I don't want to claim that Progress Is Over just because people at SXSW are self-congratulatory dopes. So two caveats. First, it would be a mistake to think that diminishing returns to digital technology means social progress in this realm must be <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Great-Stagnation-Low-Hanging-Eventually/dp/0525952713/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1332605996&amp;sr=8-1">stagnating</a>. Marginal utility declines, but computational power ascends. Individuals are able to perceive the slope of either of these functions and use it to fuel their sense of utopianism or malaise. But to know whether society as a whole is slowing down would require combining the two, which would require more fully characterizing them, and only particularly learned econometricians are wise or foolish enough to attempt that sort of thing.</p>
<p>Second, I dropped the phrase &quot;for a given technological milieu&quot; a couple of paragraphs back, but I'm asking it to do a <em>lot</em> of work. It seems likely that there are thresholds to technological progress at which discontinuities occur -- <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence">emergence</a>, they call it. Adoption of smartphones, for instance, seems to have mostly been a question of a better kind of telephone/PIM getting cheaper and cheaper, but once <em>everyone</em> has a network node with a flexible UI on them at all times, it seems likely that huge social benefits will emerge that weren't a consideration in the initial consumer-adoption calculus. But more on this in another post (one that will probably have the word &quot;innovation&quot; in it an embarrassing number of times).</p>
<p>To retreat to my point: I think that in IT, especially, we have a tendency to get confused about whether we're building a locomotive or inventing the steam engine. It's a willful confusion, it's driven by vanity, and it's now leading to disappointment -- and will do so all the more as we find we have enough locomotives on hand.</p>

                    <p>Since I might have your renewed attention, briefly (&quot;but I thought this RSS feed was broken&quot;), and since I'm already frantically promoting it on Twitter, let me draw your attention to <a class="reference external" href="http://sunlightlabs.com/blog/2012/open-states-50/">this morning's announcement from Sunlight's Open States team</a>. &nbsp;In short: we've got a new mobile app, and our services now support all fifty states (plus DC and Puerto Rico).</p>
<p>Getting to fifty is a big deal, and I'm extremely proud of Sunlight and the Open States team for reaching this milestone. &nbsp;No one's done this before; it took us years to do it ourselves.&nbsp;This data existed, but in a completely piecemeal manner -- there was no consistent location, API or data model. Getting it collected, cleaned and accessible will have real impacts for journalists, watchdogs and citizens. &nbsp;If you saw <a class="reference external" href="http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/2012/virginia-ultrasound-law-image-few-others/">Sunlight's recent work on mandatory ultrasound legislation</a> -- well, suffice it to say that there's much more coming on that front, and Open States is what's going to make it possible.</p>
<p>This was a huge&nbsp;undertaking -- honestly, I don't think anyone knew if creating and maintaining a legislative data collection architecture pulling from so many disparate sources would even be possible when we started. It's a tremendous testament to the contributors and developers who've made this possible, and the leadership of my colleague James Turk in particular. &nbsp;Nice job, you guys.</p>

                    <p>It went fine! The panel was located inconveniently in spacetime (far from downtown/first thing in the morning) and the room was huuuge (Texas, etc.) but we still managed to draw forty people, which I'll count as a win. &nbsp;Also, I'm pretty sure I didn't say anything that's going to get me fired, which is the only real criterion I use to judge these things.</p>
<p>Apropos of nothing, during preparation for the panel I discovered that the Census TIGER/LINE GIS dataset has a logo, and it's totally awesome:</p>

                    <p>Anil Dash is on stage right now talking with Nick Denton about a variety of different things, including the failed 2011 Gawker-wide redesign which, if you remember, was going to Change Webdesign Forever and then didn't. (Don't worry, I'm sure Pinterest's look will echo through the ages.)</p>
<p>More to the nominal point of the session, this is from Denton:</p>
<blockquote>
&quot;The idea of capturing the intelligence of the readership [now] sounds like a joke.&quot;</blockquote>
<p>This strikes me as right, and completely at odds with the optimistic, inclusive, democratic vision of our networked future that dominated SXSW in 2007. &nbsp;But I think it's true, and basically compatible with the (admittedly ugly) view I expressed back <a class="reference external" href="/2010/02/11/thoughts-on-buzz/">here</a>, in which part of new sites'/network's success hangs on their ability to attract early adopting elites who are genuinely <em>better</em>&nbsp;at the internet than the general online population (which arrives later, bringing advertiser dollars and ruin).</p>
<p>The net really is&nbsp;more democratic than other mediums. But that doesn't mean it's egalitarian, it just means the gating/sorting mechanism is (arguably) based on less arbitrary/unfair personal attributes than other parts of our society. &nbsp;This is about as Randian an opinion as you're likely to get out of me, but as far as I can tell it's true.</p>
<p>Denton went on to opine that democratic moderation of comments doesn't produce interesting content because it suppresses minority views; and expressed the view that anonymity is essential to both the production and consumption of Gawker's content. &nbsp;Which again, all seems right to me, though it's a little bit sad.</p>
<p><strong>MORE PROSAICALLY:</strong> Denton mentions that Gawker doesn't have some super-secret or cutting-edge analytics platform. Editors use different things -- all commercial -- based on their own preferences and priorities. &nbsp;Which makes me feel better about my general lack of interest in these tools (beyond the basics).</p>

                    <p>I'm at SXSW, and rather than tweeting about it incessantly, I think maybe I'll just post some things here.</p>
<p>I suspect that my mood will improve with the weather and after eating some tacos, but right now SXSW is a very alienating experience. &nbsp;I was last at this conference in 2007, with a bunch of people from EchoDitto. &nbsp;Emily and I had just started dating. Twitter launched here that year, and although I never thought it'd take off the way it has, it did immediately feel like something special -- maybe it would only ever be used by the kinds of people there in Austin, but for us it would be a new, enriching layer on top of reality. I was thrilled and amazed at what technology could mean and by this new, fascinating class of people who seemed to believe -- quite earnestly and intensely -- hunches about the future that I had secretly harbored but been half-embarrassed to express. I'd never known these people were real, but now I was really one of them and <em>everything</em> was going to come true.</p>
<p>That feels very far away right now. &nbsp;The weather's worse, and there are way too many people -- they're everywhere, all the panels and shuttles and bars are bursting. &nbsp;They're the same kinds of people, but by now everybody's settled on the same dream -- the mad-lib details vary, but the basic story is about startups and a kind of &quot;innovation&quot; that seems indistinguishable from a dreary march toward the combinatorial exhaustion of the current technological landscape's possibilities.</p>
<p>I'm older, and it's easier to see the contours of feasibility and to recognize how many of those dreams are unworkable or ill-advised or just mundane. &nbsp;Websockets are a great technology, but they're going to change interfaces, not lives, you know? &nbsp;Real-time data and self-quantification are interesting and will be useful in a few domains, but reality is not as procedural and deterministic as programmers' minds; most of these speculative possibilities will not pan out, even after we've built the dehumanizing foundations necessary to really put automated Taylorism through its paces and see what it can do. &nbsp;There is a terrifying amount of talk about cognitive psychology results, and I'm starting to think that the actually-quite-limited predictive power of these models at an individual level is the only thing that can possibly save us from people like my twentysomething year-old self.</p>
<p>Well. &nbsp;Like I said: tacos are indicated. &nbsp;In a moment, off to the airport to pick up a rental car and escape the shuttles. Later: panels from activists, journalists and political folks, which I think will be both less inspiring and less frightening, both of which strike me as healthy things.</p>

                    <p>Today's coordinated action in opposition to SOPA/PIPA by the internet community is something that's both heartening and inspiring. &nbsp;Its volume--despite a lack of coverage that should deeply embarrass the traditional media--and the speed with which it's prompting legislators to reverse position are both impressive. &nbsp;It could easily turn out to be remembered as the moment when &quot;the internet&quot; emerged not just as a political force but as a political constituency.</p>
<p>Still, those pointing out that today's site blackouts are corporate speech are not wrong. &nbsp;And this community's ability to call what amounts to a general strike is more than a little worrisome, at least in principle. &nbsp;The country is ever-more reliant on web companies to conduct normal business, but it has gotten into this position without entering into contractual arrangements with those companies. &nbsp;The nature of information technology's ability to scale means that the decision to deny web service will often rest in relatively few hands (with the exception of explicitly communal projects like Reddit and Wikipedia). &nbsp;This all makes me at least a little bit uneasy.</p>
<p>In practice I suspect it'll all be fine: there aren't a lot of issues with the positive optics of speech rights; and the mass net movement around SOPA/PIPA really has originated with the grassroots. &nbsp;I don't think this kind of campaign would be thinkable for web companies without some genuine democratic underpinnings to support it.</p>
<p>Still, all of this positive activist energy would be much less charming if it were being directed toward sales tax amnesty or another one of the web startup community's harebrained political priorities.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>I take it that <a class="reference external" href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/victory_lab/2012/01/project_dreamcatcher_how_cutting_edge_text_analytics_can_help_the_obama_campaign_determine_voters_hopes_and_fears_.html">this</a> is what the Obama campaign <a class="reference external" href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0711/Obama_campaign_hiring_data_mining_scientists.html">was hiring</a> &quot;data scientists&quot; to do. &nbsp;It's an interesting project, but I think the Slate writeup fails to make a few important connections.</p>
<p>First: how likely is it that the campaign actually needs a new method of gauging supporters' opinions and priorities? Not very, I'd say. Surveys and focus groups are well-developed methodologies that don't suffer from the obvious selection effect problems that a &quot;share your story&quot; feature on a website does.</p>
<p>Second: pay attention the the bits of the article recounting&nbsp;Rayid Ghani's resume. The work he did for Accenture sounds legit -- applying classic machine learning techniques to product classification and sales projections. &nbsp;But how much of it dealt with expressed opinion (&quot;share your story&quot;) versus observed behavior (&quot;was this product purchased?&quot;). &nbsp;The answer: lots of the latter, none of the former.</p>
<p>And this is important. By themselves, personal expressions are not terrifically useful. People don't know their own minds all that well. But personal expressions can be a useful signal when correlated with objective observations.</p>
<p>I think &quot;[this project is]&nbsp;about us being better listeners&quot; is an pretty generous gloss on what's being done here. The odds of this being an input to the platform or priorities of an incumbent president's campaign seem certain to be low.</p>
<p>I expect that the campaign is using this corpus of personal essays to classify supporters into better-segmented subgroups, so that more specifically customized appeals can be made to them. It's conceivable that this will be deployed for GOTV efforts, but that's a tricky experiment to run since you only get to do a trial once every few years. &nbsp;More likely this is about fundraising, with classic A/B testing used to hone the model and refine the system of segmentations and corresponding appeals. If that approach delivers better results than existing methods, they'll try to use whatever demographic characteristics are available in the voterfile to segment potential supporters who haven't helpfully supplied personal essays (&quot;he's a middle-aged white guy from Detroit--put him in the 'the bailouts worked' email group&quot;). Whether you can generalize from someone engaged enough to contribute a &quot;share your story&quot; entry to someone who isn't seems like a big if, but hey, it's worth a shot.</p>
<p>That's my guess, anyway. None of this is nefarious; it's just what campaigns do. &nbsp;But I think it's important for people to understand that, rather than a triumph of democracy-enabling technology, this is just a quantitative approach to squeezing even more money out of voters and into our political system. &nbsp;It's necessary work, but I wouldn't say it's exactly noble work.&nbsp;If you want your political opinion to shift the policy needle, you should probably start by calling or writing your representatives, not by pouring your heart out to barackobama.com.</p>

                    <p>I've been playing with <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Color-Effects-Changing-Remote-Control/dp/B004A354B8">these holiday lights</a> recently. They're very neat: each bulb has RGB LEDs embedded in it and is individually addressable (albeit with only 4 bits of resolution per color channel). Some wonderfully talented folks have <a class="reference external" href="http://www.deepdarc.com/2010/11/27/hacking-christmas-lights/">reverse-engineered</a> the protocol that the light controller uses; <a class="reference external" href="http://scottrharris.blogspot.com/2010/12/controlling-ge-color-effects-lights.html">others have written Arduino code</a> making it possible to snip the light's control line, connect it to an Arduino, and begin programming your own animations. Still others are doing various <a class="reference external" href="http://blog.jgc.org/2011/11/turning-ge-color-effects-g-35-christmas.html">neat and unusual things</a> with the result. Personally, I just want to have some interesting light displays for New Year's.</p>
<p>These other folks' work makes this possible, but not as convenient as it could be: developing new animation routines on the Arduino is a pain in the butt. To do so you write your code in the Arduino's irritating development environment, then flash it to the chip and hope that everything worked right. There's a small risk of damaging the lights, and a large chance of things going wrong.</p>
<p>So! I wrote some bridge code that moves the light control logic into Python, which can run and be manipulated on a regular ol' computer. The state of the lights is then sent to the Arduino many times per second (though not as many as I'd like -- still, only about 1FPS slower than the string's theoretical max) and the Arduino dutifully updates the state of the lights. This should make development of animations easier, and make it simpler to trigger or modulate them in response to network events or other things that the computer can detect.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/sbma44/cheerlights-arduino-python">If you have any use for this code, you can find it here</a>. For me, there are two challenges remaining: creating some interesting animations, and connecting a second string to the Arduino.</p>
<p>This latter issue is a bigger problem than you might think: the lights' address space is only 6 bits -- too small to simply connect the two strings together and retain the ability to control individual lights (bulbs can share addresses, but I'd rather not do that). So the two strings need to be treated as individual entities. That's easy enough on the Arduino side. But the Arduino is going to live at one end of this double-string, not in the middle. That means that the signal to the far string will have to be transmitted along the length of the near string. This is too much distance for a fast serial connection to traverse without being spread out into illegibility.</p>
<p>The solution, I'm told, is to shift the serial signal to RS-422, a higher-speed and more ethernet-like standard, then back to serial at the light string (it will travel along a twisted pair of conductors that I'll run along the already-too-heavy first string). I have the chips to do this, and it all *looks* pretty simple. Fingers crossed...</p>

                    <p>I just spent some time banging my head against this problem; let me save people wandering in from Google similar trouble.</p>
<p>So: you're trying to use pySerial to speak to your Arduino. It's not working. Or sometimes it is, but only when you have the Arduino Serial Monitor window open! This makes no sense.</p>
<p>Here's the deal: the Arduino's fancy &quot;you can flash new programs onto me without pressing my reset button!&quot; functionality works by resetting the damn thing whenever a new serial connection is made. With the serial monitor open, the connection's already open, so no reset happens and your script might actually work. When the monitor is closed, the Arduino resets when Python connects to it -- and the Arduino might still be busy booting up when your script begins shoving bits across the link.</p>
<p>So! You can disable this auto-reset behavior (you'll have to ask the Arduino people about that), but it seems simplest to just make your python script long-running and wait patiently for a beat or two after opening the serial link. Here's a dead-simple example:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">[cc lang=&quot;python&quot;]import serial, sys</div>
<div class="line">from time import sleep</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">SERIAL_PORT = '/dev/tty.usbmodem621'</div>
<div class="line">SERIAL_RATE = 9600</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">ser = serial.Serial(SERIAL_PORT, SERIAL_RATE)</div>
<div class="line">sleep(2)</div>
<div class="line">val = int(sys.argv[1])</div>
<div class="line">ser.write(chr(val))[/cc]</div>
</div>
<p>Here's the Arduino sketch. It just blinks the LED on pin 13 however many times you sent as a byte (I'm working on sending binary-ish data over the serial link; hence the use of raw byte values):</p>
<p>[cc lang=&quot;java&quot;]byte inByte = 0;</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">void setup()</div>
<div class="line">{</div>
<div class="line">Serial.begin(9600);</div>
<div class="line">pinMode(13, OUTPUT);</div>
<div class="line">}</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">void loop()</div>
<div class="line">{</div>
<div class="line">if (Serial.available() &gt; 0) {</div>
<div class="line">inByte = Serial.read();</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">for(int i=0;i digitalWrite(13, HIGH);</div>
<div class="line">delay(500);</div>
<div class="line">digitalWrite(13, LOW);</div>
<div class="line">delay(500);</div>
<div class="line">}</div>
<div class="line">}</div>
<div class="line">}</div>
<div class="line">[/cc]</div>

<p>But of course this is nonsense. &nbsp;To a first approximation every American can afford to use the telephone and the post office. And in urban and suburban areas, at least, libraries make computers widely available. &nbsp;What marginalized people lack is time, attention and education. &nbsp;Maybe they don't have a cellular data plan either, but first things first. &nbsp;Besides, to the extent that technology access <em>is</em>&nbsp;a real problem,&nbsp;falling electronics prices are likely to do much more to address the issue than even the most conscientiously designed interfaces (on this score, the news on smartphone penetration is <a class="reference external" href="http://blog.nielsen.com/nielsenwire/online_mobile/generation-app-62-of-mobile-users-25-34-own-smartphones/">very encouraging</a>).</p>
<p>Still, just because projects that concentrate on technological deficits are focusing on a small and relatively unimportant part of a dauntingly large problem doesn't mean that such efforts aren't laudable. &nbsp;There's always room for making a difference at the margin. &nbsp;And there's something to be said for principle. &nbsp;Designing our work to be inclusive and truly democratic is important -- sometimes more important than maintaining a depressingly realistic appraisal of our chances for coding our way to egalitarianism.</p>
<p>(I should probably add that I think creating accessible interfaces for politically engaged populations that have difficulty using technology -- the disabled, seniors, etc -- is a very different endeavor from the broader/gloomier digital divide issue)</p>

<blockquote>
[...] Once the cable company has built the infrastructure to deliver cable to your house and given you the box, it doesn’t cost them any more money to give you 100 channels rather than 10. To be sure, building infrastructure&nbsp;<em>capable of delivering more channels</em>&nbsp;costs more money. But once the infrastructure’s built, it can deliver what it can deliver and there are no incremental savings to achieve by not using all the capacity. I think it’s completely true that cable television has become a questionable value proposition—it’s extremely expensive and though the infrastructure to deliver hundreds of channels to the home is impressive, it’s not actually useful since nobody watches that many channels. What we actually need is faster broadband internet. But the infrastructure’s already built. Refusing to use it doesn’t reduce the suppliers’ costs and wouldn’t save customers any money.</blockquote>
<p>Two things. First, the cable company buys its content from various aggregators and producers of video product. I'm sure that the terms of these purchases vary considerably, and to some degree must be tied to consumer demand for that content. But there is marginal cost to adding a new channel even if there isn't marginal cost to distributing it. There's necessarily cross-subsidization going on, which means some viewers are getting a raw deal. Probably most of them, I'd argue: given the lack of choice in the market, there are strong incentives for the cable company to add new channels in order to widen their customer base; they can simply add the new features to their existing customers' tabs. iTunes, Amazon and Netflix can be understood to be competing with cable and satellite largely on the basis of offering a non-venti option to consumers (to borrow Matt's analogy) and they're having a lot of success with it because many people rightly intuit that they're not consuming $100 worth of video product every month.</p>
<p>Second, nearly all cable systems are now or soon will be digital, which means they're packet-switched, which means that, to varying degrees, broadband capacity and video capacity are fungible. The actual details are, I'm sure, quite convoluted and complex, and we're not going to be able to hash them out here without help from someone who understands the relative merits of different versions of DOCSIS. But it's safe to say that there is one copper conductor entering your house that handles both internet and TV, and that the portion allocated to each can be changed through configuration choices made by your cable vendor.</p>

<p>Somehow Charles talked me into doing the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.primalmudrun.com/race/primal-mid-atlantic/">Primal Mud Run</a> on Saturday. It's true that I've been adopting more of his crazed fitness strategies over the last year, but this was still an entirely new thing for me. &nbsp;I'm not a very good runner, and making my 5k debut with an event that also involved mud and obstacles was daunting. &nbsp;Today I'm sore and my lungs seem to still be reconfiguring themselves to a level of functional ambition they had never before considered. But I'm glad I did it.</p>
<p>One part was particularly interesting. The most unpleasant obstacle involved wading into a very cold pond and swimming under some barrels. &nbsp;You know how when you hit your thumb with a hammer or burn your hand on the stove, and say &quot;Ow!&quot;, there's some sense of volition tied to the exclamation? I mean, it's not a deliberate act, exactly, saying &quot;ow&quot;. &nbsp;But you could suppress it if you wanted to.</p>
<p>Well, each time I came up from under those barrels I was surprised to hear myself emit a sort of pathetic howl/whimper, not dissimilar to the ones tough-minded Jack Bauer might have drawn from a sinister interrogation subject. &nbsp;It was just completely automatic and beyond my control. It's always interesting and horrifying when you discover some new thing your body does without asking your permission. I&nbsp;trudged through the rest of the event in a kind of animal stupor, and when I was done Charles had to show me where I'd left my jacket.</p>
<p>But this was all pathetic and ludicrous. A hundred yards away, trucks were selling beer and barbecue sandwiches. Other participants were running in halloween costumes, tutus and thrift-store suit jackets.</p>
<p>All of which just goes to show that I would have made a terrible Marine. And the next time you hear me speculating about strategies for surviving the collapse of civilization, you should probably roll your eyes even harder than you normally would've.</p>

<p>As is probably obvious, I think there are good reasons to be excited about information technology's capacity to improve governance. For the small stuff, it already has -- I can get a new recycling bin delivered just by visiting a website!</p>
<p>But for the really big stuff -- like keeping track of how we award multi-million dollar contracts, or how we regulate polluters, or how we track the political influence economy -- there are significant barriers to applying automated analysis. A lack of usable corporate identifiers is among the biggest of these problems. Citizens are expected to have trackable identifiers for their cars, and firearms, and selves. I have to surrender my SSN to a private entity just to see if I'm allowed to buy a new phone!</p>
<p>But for companies, the situation is quite different. Corporate registrations are held by states, which face bad incentives around making this data usable both because inaccessible registration information makes the state more attractive to registrants, and because states collect substantial sums for use of the data. Meanwhile, the federal government is wrapped in a nightmare tangle of purpose-built ID fiefdoms and one overarching public-private partnership that supplies identifier data that's both unacceptably restricted and of unacceptably poor quality.</p>
<p>Attempts to improve the situation will no doubt be met with much gnashing of virtual teeth: competitiveness! Privacy! Personhood! None of these hold much water, though: not only has relevant tax return information (which would go a long way toward solving this problem) been completely public at various times in our nation's history, but other countries impose a disclosure burden adequate to resolve the problem while still enjoying vibrant, competitive economies.</p>
<p>Anyway, my colleagues make this case more rigorously and persuasively both <a class="reference external" href="http://sunlightfoundation.com/sixdegrees/">at this microsite</a> and in <a class="reference external" href="http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2011/11/01/we-cant-have-corporate-accountability-until-we-have-corporate-identifiers/">this blog post</a> (about the overall problem) and <a class="reference external" href="http://sunlightlabs.com/blog/2011/physics-of-the-corporate-universe/">this one</a> (about the technical considerations behind our presentation). I hope you'll give it all a look.</p>

                    <p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/6289961509/"><img alt="our office sodastream" class="right" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6118/6289961509_d57ac2512a_m.jpg" style="width: 180px; height: 240px;" /></a>Over the past few years, many of you have heard me evangelize the gospel of home carbonation. At work we've recently taken things to a new level, and I've had a couple of people ask me questions about it. As you can imagine, I'm delighted to answer them. But let's begin at the beginning.</p>
<p>My interest is in making seltzer water -- growing up we called it &quot;bubbly water&quot;, and my dad bought it by the case. I'm not sure why I like it so much: the slightly acid tang of the carbonic acid in solution? The cooling, quenching sensation I feel as the dissolved gas pushes the water out of my stomach, into my intestine and on to my bloodstream? I'm not sure. But I really like it.</p>
<p>Until recently, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/iSi-2248-Siphon-Brushed-Aluminum/dp/B00007JXR7">soda siphons</a> were the only way to make seltzer at home. But the pricing doesn't work: the tiny CO2 cannisters that power the things, while handy -- my dad once told me that in his youth he used to stuff empties full of matchheads to create what must have been an awesomely dangerous projectile -- are so expensive that you're much better off lugging liter bottles home from the store.</p>
<p>My then-neighbor <a class="reference external" href="http://goodspeedupdate.com/">Rob Goodspeed</a> was the first person I knew to have a Soda Club. It was during the golden age of PR flacks sending bloggers things for no apparent reason, and Rob had cofounded DCist, earning him rights to substantial swag. Most of these pitches were laughably inept either because the product was awful or the pitch was tone-deaf (as a technology blogger, <em>of course</em> I was the right person to email about <a class="reference external" href="http://www.kernelseasons.com/">custom popcorn flavoring powders</a>). It didn't feel like much of an ethical conundrum -- it was all too stupid for that. But occasionally the flacks would succeed, and <a class="reference external" href="http://dcist.com/2005/11/carbonating_in.php">the original Soda Club was such a case</a>. Rob was justifiably enthusiastic about the product, and as soon as I saw it I decided to buy one for myself. I've gone on to buy units for friends and parents and siblings, and I've talked many more people into doing the same. It's a great product.</p>
<p>The company has since rebranded to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.sodastream.com/">SodaStream</a> (I like to think our Club is no longer accepting new members), and is even publicly traded (as <a class="reference external" href="http://finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=SODA+Interactive#chart2:symbol=soda;range=1y;compare=vti;indicator=volume;charttype=line;crosshair=on;ohlcvalues=0;logscale=on;source=undefined">$SODA</a>, of course). My original Soda Club carbonator is still going strong.</p>
<p>its operation is simple. You fill a bottle with a liter of cold water and screw it into the unit. You depress a button several times, until the overflow valve starts to make a horrible flatulent sound. The bottle leaves the machine with an infinitely satisfying <em>chffff</em> noise, like a tiny, refreshing alien disembarking from his pressurized spaceship. You're then free to add flavored syrups (carbonating anything other than pure water is a big no-no). SodaStream is happy to sell you those syrups, of course -- their Red Bull knockoff isn't bad, and avoiding giant flat bottles of tonic water is worth some flavor sacrifices. But the last time I checked (2005) many of the other flavors were underwhelming. Oh well: soda's bad for you anyway.</p>
<p>Even if you just want seltzer, you'll need SodaStream to sell you replacement CO2. This was their real innovation: the carbonator units contain replaceable cannisters of compressed gas that are much larger than those used by soda siphons. A refill costs $25 or $30 bucks (there are two sizes -- I strongly recommend the larger) and can either be delivered to your home or, as of late last year, picked up from most Bed Bath &amp; Beyond or Ace Hardware stores. I go through two or three of the larger cannisters per year.</p>
<p>As you might imagine, there's a bit of a markup on the gas. Quite a bit, in fact, though it's still a great deal compared to the alternatives that used to exist. Still...</p>
<p>I work with a number of fellow seltzer enthusiasts, and more than a few of them are also people who don't like the idea of business models based on lock-in. So once we had resolved to get a SodaStream for the office, it wasn't long until we came across <a class="reference external" href="http://co2doctor.com/">co2doctor.com</a>.</p>
<p>Compressed CO2 is easy to buy, as I found out in college when I built a kegerator. Any welding supply shop will be happy to sell you the stuff -- the good old boys in the Charlottesville shop asked if I was &quot;makin' some suds&quot; (I was). And like any good industrial byproduct, it's cheap: refilling one of tanks those guys use costs about the same amount as a SodaStream refill, but provides many times as much CO2.</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/6296475569/"><img alt="Siphon Tank" class="right" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6234/6296475569_ee3b718333_m.jpg" style="width: 167px; height: 240px;" /></a>SodaStream's gas cannisters -- they're properly referred to as &quot;bottles&quot; from here on out -- aren't designed to be refilled with standard equipment. There are booby-traps built into the valves. If you want to use bulk CO2, you need to avoid those valves. You've got two options for doing so:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>You can connect a CO2 cannister directly to your carbonator using the <a class="reference external" href="http://co2doctor.com/freedomoonespec.htm">FreedomOne</a>.</li>
<li>You can <a class="reference external" href="http://co2doctor.com/freedomvalvespec.htm">replace the valve</a> on a SodaStream bottle, then use the <a class="reference external" href="http://co2doctor.com/fillstationproIIspec.htm">FillStation</a> to refill it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Option 1 is appealing if you've got the space for it (SodaStream carbonators look good on a kitchen countertop; industrial CO2 cannisters do not). Our office chose the second option in order to make it possible for staff to refill CO2 cannisters for home use.</p>
<p>The option you select has implications for which CO2 tank you buy. If you're carbonating directly from the tank (option 1) you need a tank that dispenses gas. If you're refilling bottles, you need one that dispenses liquid CO2 -- a so-called siphon tank, which connects the tank valve to the bottom of the cylinder via a sort of metal straw. Either type can be acquired, full, for less than $100.</p>
<p>Replacing the valve was pretty easy. Discharge the bottle fully by pressing in the valve pin with a pen (do this outside; wear glasses or goggles). Find yourself a vice, or a couple of friends with excellent grip strength. You'll need a proper wrench, but once you have one the operation is easy: the valve simply unscrews. Replace it with the FreedomValve, using the supplied o-ring. Tighten it very securely.</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/6297007206/"><img alt="FillStation Pro" class="center" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6113/6297007206_921e97a47f.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: 375px;" /></a></p>
<p>Refilling the bottle is also easy. Once again: eye protection. Make sure all valves are closed. Connect to the tank; connect to the bottle. Open the FillStation's smaller valve to flush any pressure in the bottle. Close it. Open the large valve on the tank. Open the large valve on the FillStation. Listen for satisfying whooshing and gurgling. The good CO2 Doctor is very insistent that you fill your bottle by weight, and that you never overfill it -- but he also acknowledges that the laws of physics make it impossible to fill it to capacity using a mere siphon tank (as opposed to the exciting machinery that presumably exists at SodaStream World HQ). We weighed the bottle carefully and filled slowly, but we found that letting pressure completely equalize between the two worked just fine and left us within safety limits. Close the FillStation valve. Close the tank valve. Disconnect the bottle (there will be whooshing!). And for pete's sake remove the FillStation from the tank, lest it tip over, break off the valve and turn everything into an episode of MythBusters.</p>
<p>And that's it! At work <a class="reference external" href="http://boyinthebands.com/">Scott</a> has crunched the numbers and determined that refilling bottles for home use will entail a $4 per-bottle fee. That gets you about 80% of a full charge -- not bad! The $30 valve replacement will have paid for itself in just two bottles. But if you don't have a group that wants to share a siphon tank, you might be better off using the direct-to-tank adapter (for a breakdown of cost recovery using that method, see <a class="reference external" href="http://co2doctorfreedomoneplusreview.blogspot.com/">this post</a>). Or hell, just use SodaStream's bottle refill service like a sane person.</p>

<p>I won't bore everyone with an explanation of the character (I did quite enough of that last night) but if you like superhero comics and haven't read <em>Invincible</em>, you really should.

<p>I'm sorry the man is dead. I'm sorry when anyone dies. He accomplished a lot; he made my life better.</p>
<p>But Steve Jobs' life is a tragedy. Read <a class="reference external" href="http://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/comphist/sj1.html">this interview</a>. And <a class="reference external" href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/4.02/jobs_pr.html">this one</a>. Jobs was a man who understood the problems facing our society. But he was also a man who canceled all corporate philanthropy at Apple upon taking control; who cited profitability concerns as the reason, but who didn't reinstate those programs even after creating the most valuable technology company in the world. He was, it seems to me, a man who wielded incredible power, but who chose to devote himself and that power exclusively to the creation of beautiful, perfect consumer objects. A man who seemed frightened of trying to address real problems directly.</p>
<p>I think he was absolutely nuts.</p>
<p>Bill Gates might be responsible for foisting a worse operating system upon the world, but you can't deny that he behaves like a conscientious human being.</p>

                    <p>In the past I've been vaguely aware that the Booker Prize list was a good source of reading suggestions, and also that <a class="reference external" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2010/oct/07/booker-prize-betting-suspended-tom-mccarthy">people gamble on it</a>, which almost makes reading seem cool (obviously it's not, if any kids are reading this you should probably be off learning to smoke instead). But this year is the first time I've had an informed opinion about the books that are up for the prize. Well, the ones on the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.themanbookerprize.com/news/stories/1533">short list</a>, anyway: I'm not a particularly fast reader, but I happened to make lucky guesses when I decided to read some things from the long list. When the short list came out, getting through it seemed surprisingly achievable, thanks in part to all the shows I've been watching on Netflix settling into storylines that I found unwatchably depressing.</p>
<p>So hey! Let's blog about it, since that's something I'm trying to do more of:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Though it's not the quote-unquote best of these novels, I had the most fun reading <em>The Sisters Brothers</em> -- man, do I ever love westerns. Reluctant killers! Lonesome dignity! It's all great, and if you liked <em>Deadwood</em> or <em>Blood Meridian</em> or <em>Unforgiven</em> you'll probably like this book, too.</li>
<li>I think <em>Snowdrops</em> is being turned into a movie and I imagine it'll be a pretty decent one, like <em>The American</em> or <em>The Ghost Writer</em> or any of those Graham Greene or Le Carre adaptations that sort of make you remember how great the Jason Bourne movies but also allow you to pat yourself on the back for being so much more sophisticated than all that (which compensates for how much less bored you'd be if you were watching Matt Damon beat the hell out of some guy in a customs office). The book itself felt a little thin, but since a lot of my friends are Russophiles I won't hesitate to recommend it. This is one of the few on this list I own as a physical artifact, too, so if anyone's interested in borrowing it they should let me know.</li>
<li><em>The Sense of an Ending</em> is beautifully written, but meditative and depressing. This book has got a lot of contemplating-a-life-lived-and-going-&quot;meh&quot;. Maybe that's the kind of thing I'll want to read when I'm contemplating my life (lived). But I sort of hope not, and it certainly isn't the kind of thing I want to read today. Still, this is a undeniably masterful novella and if it wins I wouldn't be surprised (having just checked the odds after writing the non-parenthetical part of this sentence, it seems no one else would be surprised, either).</li>
<li><em>Jamrach's Menagerie</em> is the worst of the lot. It's pretentious and melodramatic and hasn't got much of a plan or a point. It did make me tear up at one point, but that's because I'm a sentimental idiot. Also: it's about a doomed sea voyage, not a menagerie, and only barely includes a guy named Jamrach. The author seems to think that <em>Moby Dick</em> was great, and you know what, she's right. Read that instead. (Also: yes, yes, the <em>actual</em> titular menagerie is the motley collection of characters, or whatever. Bah.)</li>
<li><em>Half-Blood Blues</em> is very good, but the narrative voice was a little hard to take. The protagonist is supposed to be a world-weary Baltimore jazzman, and his conversational, dialect-filled means of speaking is how the story is related to the reader. But it's a little strange to be constantly dropping pluralization and contractions, only to turn around and describe a waking bandmate's eyelids as &quot;fluttering like moths.&quot; Do jazzmen speak this way? Maybe I'm being unfair to jazzmen, but I doubt it. For the record, I am completely on board with the idea that someone can speak in vernacular while still having a rich inner life. For instance: I sometimes say &quot;y'all&quot;, yet I still care deeply about composing rambling, grandiloquent humblebraggy blog posts about the novels I've read! But I feel like some separation needs to be maintained. Edugyan's decision to allow vernacular into the narrator's sometimes-ornate inner monologue didn't ring true. On the other hand, this is a lovely book about jealousy and rivalry and friendship, and the action is set against the fascinating backdrop of the jazz scene of Berlin and Paris at the start of WWII. It's a well-executed, graceful book, and if you aren't bugged by the narration you'll probably really like it.</li>
<li>Speaking of narrative voice: I am kind of shocked that <em>Pigeon English</em> is <a class="reference external" href="http://www.themanbookerprize.com/news/stories/1537">not the favorite to win</a>. The book's success <a class="reference external" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/bookreviews/8362385/Pigeon-English-by-Stephen-Kelman-review.html">is an inspiring true story, and its content is a tragic true one</a>, for one thing. It's also just kind of amazingly good. The story is presented in the voice of its ten year-old protagonist, and the feat is pulled off perfectly. I have serendipitously gotten to know a kid that age over the last year; if I hadn't, I'm not sure I would've believed how crazy and simple and wonderful <em>PE</em> makes their minds out to be. But that's what they're like! It's probably torture to be around one for more than a couple of hours, but spending a few hundred pages in one's head is a surprisingly rewarding experience. I think this is the only book of the six that's going to stick with me, and I hope it wins.</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyway, as you can see I'm toying with the idea of having opinions about novels instead of opinions about music, as I'm now super-old and <a class="reference external" href="/2010/05/14/sleigh-bells/">it's all just noise anyway</a> (young people! so awful, right?). If you feel like joining me in this endeavor you should consider signing up for <a class="reference external" href="http://goodreads.com/">Goodreads</a>, which is kind of a terrible site but seems like a useful way to subject yourself to social pressure to read more and better books. Kay alone has probably shamed me into reading an extra thousand pages this year.</p>

                    <p>While I'm posting an inexplicable amount, let me just say that I appreciate <a class="reference external" href="http://thinkprogress.org/yglesias/2011/09/29/330940/if-you-want-politicians-to-spend-less-time-fundraising-give-them-free-money/">Matt's response</a> to <a class="reference external" href="/2011/09/28/its-not-crazy-to-think-that-money-in-politics-is-a-problem/">my post</a> about Dylan Ratigan's proposed ban on money in elections. In principle I agree that public financing could help with this problem. In practice, I think it's very, very rare that campaigns feel they spend beyond the point of diminishing returns (you do <em>occasionally</em> hear this about particular states or markets, so it's possible, just rare). That means that raising outside money will still be perceived as an advantage, which means politicians will keep doing it. Public funds might just inflate the prices of things that campaigns buy.</p>
<p>But hey, maybe not. I suppose the elasticity of fundraising behavior is the real question here (it might even be one that could be <a class="reference external" href="http://politicalpartytime.org/">empirically tested</a>). Perhaps easier money would help, but I think there are reasons -- mostly having to do with the culture of Capitol Hill -- for doubting it.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>I had a little bit of back and forth with Tim on Twitter about Solyndra and loan guarantees. When I first came to Sunlight I worked on <a class="reference external" href="http://subsidyscope.org">Subsidyscope</a>, and while I wouldn't want to claim deep expertise on the subject, it's certainly the case that I used the phrase &quot;loan guarantee&quot; several thousand times more frequently than the average pre-Solyndra American. I have no interest in defending Solyndra or the specific decision to subsidize their work, but I think at least <em>some</em> of the interest in this issue is driven by genuine confusion about this subsidy type and not cynical partisan scandal-seeking.</p>
<p>Subsidyscope has a <a class="reference external" href="http://subsidyscope.org/loans/#loanguarantees">great explanation</a> of how loan guarantees work; you should have a look at it. But wouldn't it be wonderful if there was a metaphorical version available that was full of folksy nonsense? I thought so, too.</p>
<p>So let's say the government needs some dynamite. Maybe Capitol Hill has some stumps to clear; maybe the Vice President is going fishing. Whatever the reason, there's a problem: the market isn't supplying enough dynamite for what they have in mind. In fact, a 22 year-old intern at GAO has recently estimated that we will need the output of fully three more dynamite factories to reach the necessary supply level (though he is also quick to point out that all of his input data is of terrible quality; that dynamite experts express varying opinions; that more research is necessary; and, of course, that Challenges Remain. His report does have a rather nice introduction about the history of governmental involvement in the explosives industry, though).</p>
<p>Fine, maybe we ought to build some dynamite factories. Not so fast! Each factory costs $1 million, which also happens to be the entire amount available at current GSA fishing trip reimbursement rates. That won't get the job done!</p>
<p>Luckily, the market can help us out. It turns out that there are businessmen interested in building dynamite factories. The problem, as any dynamite entrepreneur will tell you, is that any such a factory has a 25% chance of blowing up shortly after the ribbon-cutting ceremony. Unfortunately, the current state of the market makes this an unacceptable risk, what with all the regulatory uncertainty and undocumented workers and job-killing health care bills and whatnot. The businessmen wish they could help, but right now there's simply no way they can justify building those factories. If a factory exploded, its owners would be ruined.</p>
<p>&quot;Aha!&quot; says the government. &quot;I know what we can do! We'll just pick the four most promising dynamite factory proposals and tell their authors that if they go ahead with building, we'll promise to cover the cost of their investment if their factory explodes.&quot;</p>
<p>With this guarantee in hand, the businessmen proceed. They build four factories. One explodes. Whoops! Don't worry, no one was hurt and it looked pretty rad. Uncle Sam cuts a check and everyone's happy. The government has now spent a million dollars and gotten the three factories it needed. Nice! If they had tried to build a factory themselves, they could have only afforded one -- really, three-quarters of one, since it might have blown up (some say government-built dynamite factories are even more prone to this defect that those of the private sector).</p>
<p>So this is the idea: that the government can offer guarantees that tip unacceptably risky -- but not totally foolhardy! -- economic activity over into the realm of realization. The government is using its unique powers to shift risk instead of shifting resources directly. Sometimes shifting risk can allow money to flow through the economy in new and desirable ways. And it's often dramatically cheaper than spending funds directly to achieve the same result.</p>
<p>In some ways this is a very efficient way to spend subsidy dollars. In others, not so much: you're picking winners, you're shoving money into the finance system where some will be skimmed off, you're relying on risk estimates which sometimes just aren't that good. <a class="reference external" href="http://cfda.gov">CFDA.gov</a> lists 68 such programs right now; <a class="reference external" href="https://www.cfda.gov/index?s=program&amp;mode=form&amp;tab=step1&amp;id=068c899a15935e2d7198406c2852dca2">here's one that helps build ships and shipyards</a>. <a class="reference external" href="http://subsidyscope.org/transportation/risk-transfers/exim/">Here's one that subsidizes the purchase of Boeing aircraft</a> (note that in this case the default costs are balanced by gains from interest on successful transactions).</p>
<p>I haven't followed the Solyndra story very closely, but my understanding is that changing market conditions overtook their business very rapidly. The financing pipeline supporting them should have noticed this and shut down but didn't, either because of bureaucratic inertia or special favors or both. That's unfortunate. Luckily, the government's total exposure is likely to be much less than the $500 million face value that's being widely cited, and the final cost of the program that administered the loan guarantee is likely to be a small fraction of the face value of the lending it enabled.</p>
<p>All of this is a separate question from whether the government should be intervening in the economy in this manner. I think that's a conversation worth having. But it should be a conversation about programs, not transactions. To focus on one failed loan is a bit like pointing to a lottery winner and saying, &quot;<em>That's</em> how they think we're going to pay for our schools -- by handing out checks? What a bunch of dopes!&quot; But of course this ignores the bigger picture. Perhaps there is a problem with that lotto payout, but that's a different and frankly less important issue than whether it's wise for the government to run a lottery. This is why the intense focus on Solyndra strikes me and many others as a transparently partisan feeding frenzy rather than a considered discussion of energy policy.</p>

                    <p><em>Usual disclaimer: I'm not speaking for my employer.</em></p>
<p>Matt wrote <a class="reference external" href="http://thinkprogress.org/yglesias/2011/09/27/330310/what-problem-is-getting-money-out-of-politics-supposed-to-solve/">a post</a> keying off of Dylan Ratigan's proposal to outlaw money in politics. He doesn't see the point of it:</p>
<blockquote>
Like let’s say you’re Elizabeth Warren and you want to run a campaign against Scott Brown. How do you pay your campaign manager? How do you let people know that you’re running? To me, this doesn’t solve the problem that when Washington regulates the financial system, it’s dependent for expertise on people with ties to the financial industry. It doesn’t solve the problem of the revolving door. It doesn’t solve the problem that politicians need the “legislative subsidy” of lobbyists to do policy analysis. Nor does it solve the problem of monied interests exercising disproportionate influence over think tanks, advocacy groups, or even (through speaking fees and the like) journalists and pundits. Presumably the people who make the F-22 will still be allowed to advertise about how high levels of defense spending are awesome, just as ExxonMobile will still be allowed to advertise about how fossil fuel extraction is the road to prosperity. You’ll have created some big new logistical hassles for political campaigns without, I think, addressing any concrete issues.</blockquote>
<p>I don't watch Ratigan's show, so I don't know for sure, but I would be surprised if he was pitching this proposal as a way to end lobbying as a legislative subsidy, much less as a means to address the revolving door problem. And of course there won't ever be a silver bullet that makes money completely irrelevant to the political process.</p>
<p>But, contra Matt, I think it's easy enough to see Ratigan's motivation. In the absence of contributions, campaigns would have to deprofessionalize and rely to an even greater degree on motivated volunteers. An optimist would say that this might produce less homogenous candidates and campaigns, but you could easily make the case that it would just entrench the electoral power of crazy old people.</p>
<p>On the legislative subsidy front, well-funded lobbying campaigns would no doubt still yield results. But it's not crazy to think the situation would be improved if corporate lobbyists were competing for legislators' attention with public interest NGOs on a level playing field. Matt says that &quot;it’s too difficult for elected officials to get expert technical opinion on issues without relying on interested parties,&quot; but outside of the government itself I'd say that avoiding interested parties when seeking advice is pretty much a non-starter.</p>
<p>I think the most compelling argument for defunding elections is that it might select for a different class of politician. I've read estimates from retired congressmen that put the share of their time spent fundraising in the 30% range. That's insane. To endure the rigors of constantly begging wealthy supporters for large sums of money -- to say nothing of excelling at it -- must require a very strange set of skills. I suspect that those skills don't relate much to aptitude for governing. And I suspect that that time investment comes at the expense of other duties. I'm not naive enough to think we'd have a wave election that stuffed Capitol Hill with policy experts. But perhaps we'd get a few, along with some better orators, coalition-builders, horse-traders and glad-handers.</p>
<p>To be clear, it's obvious that Ratigan's proposal is mostly about making good TV (a nobler motivation than most proposals to amend the Constitution). And I don't want to pretend that it wouldn't carry substantial problems. Offhand, it seems very likely that, short of explicit restrictions on political speech, this policy would just formalize the de facto requirement that candidates be personally wealthy; celebrity candidates would be massively empowered by their name recognition; the press's political coverage pathologies would become all the more problematic as their role in conveying campaign messages increased in importance; turnout might drop, leaving an electorate that behaves more like primary voters, selecting for politicians with more extreme views; and the whole thing would be an enforcement nightmare.</p>
<p>Still. It's hard to escape the sense that federal politicians have become so professionalized -- so good at the game they play, so aware that the incentives they face have little to do with the quality of governance they deliver -- that we're all beginning to suffer for it. I'm not sure there's a solution to this problem short of a societal collapse and reboot, but it's easy to see why an optimist reach for a different answer.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>Matt pointed me to <a class="reference external" href="http://groups.drupal.org/node/176914">this post</a>, by Matt Rognlie, as an argument against my <a class="reference external" href="/2011/09/19/a-rare-opportunity/">previous post</a>'s a la carte pricing dreams. &nbsp;I've seen this pro-bundling argument before, but I'm not swayed by it. Still, since I now have several people who are smarter than me about economics telling me I'm wrong, perhaps it's best to spell out my objections here rather than via sputtering, half-formed tweets.</p>
<p>Unbundling might be desirable even if it reduces efficiency in dollars per entertainment program available. It might be desirable even if it raises the price per entertainment program consumed! &nbsp;As you might've guessed, what follows will have more than a whiff of paternalism about it. I know that some people feel that so long as a dollar isn't spent on a drug raid, a war, or some other destructive purpose, the appropriateness of its use shouldn't be questioned. I'm at least a little bit sympathetic to that view. Still, I think the TV industry has understandably structured itself in a way that maximizes television consumption (in both dollars and time--but mostly dollars), reaching a level above what most consumers would prefer. I think the industry has been able to do so because of various limits on competition. Consequently I'll be glad to see its size reduced, even if by some measures the result is a worse deal.</p>
<p>It's obvious that we have too much television. &nbsp;This should be apparent even if you consider me a snob for thinking society would be improved if <a class="reference external" href="http://www.spike.com/shows/repo-games">Repo Games</a> were disappeared forever (and, ideally, its creators imprisoned). The still-recent advent of high-quality time-shifting/on-demand technology removes 24-hour programming as a requirement for television outlets; and allows content, free of time constraints, to be efficiently recycled to viewers who previously couldn't watch it. This should have allowed us to dramatically reduce the amount of television that's being produced and sold while keeping viewers' satisfaction constant. But of course that didn't happen[1].</p>
<p>Now to Rognlie's argument. While in broad terms the windfall of utility from infinite supply born of zero marginal cost seems like it should dwarf any fixed costs, in practice -- at the level of an individual subscriber -- it seems as though the utility we derive from additional television consumption and variety falls off quickly. Netflix streaming's success -- despite wide acknowledgement that its selection is poor -- speaks to an appetite for satisficing behavior in this area, doesn't it? Most people would agree that there is a lot of garbage on TV and that they are paying too much for it. I appreciate that Rognlie's argument anticipates this, but in practice it seems doubtful that everyone will have perfectly idiosyncratic views about what that garbage is in the way that his parks example supposes[2]. It seems like there are good reasons for thinking that we are investing more resources in television production than a real market dynamic would afford.</p>
<p>I don't like Rognlie's use of parks. I think it's an appeal to emotion, and that it ignores parks' function as a means of progressively redistributing resources and as a source of positive externalities. The metaphor that's more commonly applied to the cable industry -- correctly, I think -- is an all-you-can-eat buffet[3].</p>
<p>The buffet business model allows for a lot of variety in dishes, but at a low level of quality. &nbsp;Diners will be stuck cross-subsidizing one another in fairly arbitrary ways, and may face incentives to overconsume as they draw near the grim end of their personal utility functions. &nbsp;Decisions about how to allocate resources within the restaurant will be made in a way that's only vaguely connected to market signals; to the extent that those decisions reflect diners' preferences at all, they will probably be plagued by selection effects.</p>
<p>Buffets suck. They're a bad deal for almost everyone.</p>
<p>Right now the home TV industry gives consumers few non-buffet choices. I think that's likely to change, that it'll mean fewer total resources will be directed toward the industry, that consumer satisfaction with the programming they buy will increase, and that that will be a good thing.</p>
<p>[1] There's no reason that consumer satisfaction would <em>have</em> to remain constant, of course. But in a real market you'd expect consumers to be able to take the gains from this type of innovation either as consumption or by saving money while keeping consumption constant, right? The television vendors' market power means that this latter scenario is not an option; gains have to be taken as consumption. The falling share of per capita hours spent on TV suggests to me that consumers would prefer to allocate this windfall differently.</p>
<p>[2] And in practice it doesn't seem as though the proliferation of channels really has afforded the kind of utility-enhancing long-tail variety that a la carte opponents suppose. &nbsp;Not to get all Current TV on you (assuming Current TV still exists), but economic and cultural realities have led to each new channel &nbsp;just carving out tiny new &quot;lifestyle&quot; niches in the same suburban, straight, white, consumerist orientation. The model can't even support a music video channel, for pete's sake, or programming for huge market segments (women! black people! hispanics!) that isn't an insulting, low-budget joke.</p>
<p>[3] Food has a real marginal cost, of course, but the price of cranking out one more steam tray of crappy lo mein is minimal compared to the operation's fixed costs (which, for this argument, include the costs of adding each new menu item). And in most cases adding another menu item won't push a diner to consume more in absolute terms; it'll just improve the diner's lot by providing them with more variety, shifting how they allocate their choices prior to getting full.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>It's not often that I disagree with Tim Lee, so let me relish this. &nbsp;I think Netflix is being smart! &nbsp;Or at least not-that-unwise. <a class="reference external" href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/timothylee/2011/09/19/netflix-is-not-facing-the-innovators-dilemma/">Tim casts his argument</a> in terms of movie availability, and from that perspective he's probably right: the DVD-only Qwikster (or however you spell it) might have a bit less leverage in amassing movie libraries than the currently-unified Netflix (then again, it might not; as far as I know Netflix has only committed to splitting its brand and customer base; the two entities might still sit together at the bargaining table).</p>
<p>But I think this fails to recognize the ambition of Netflix's plans. They're not competing with Blockbuster, or Redbox, or jeez, who is even in the movie rental business anymore? &nbsp;They're now competing with DirecTV and Comcast, first by agreeing to sell consumers video content by the ounce instead of the unwieldy, one-size-fits-all sacks of the stuff that the cable companies insist upon. &nbsp;Second, I imagine they'll begin riding the&nbsp;inevitable logic of a la carte pricing to its conclusion, making more deals with both marquee and low-cost cable channels, allowing customers to add that pre-time-shifted content to their lineups for a couple of bucks a month. &nbsp;Netflix is also pursuing <a class="reference external" href="http://www.deadline.com/2011/03/netflix-to-enter-original-programming-with-mega-deal-for-david-fincher-kevin-spacey-drama-series-house-of-cards/">original programming</a>, establishing itself not only as a cheaper, higher-tech and more convenient disintermediating marketplace for television, but as an exclusive provider of certain high-esteem shows (imagine if they do manage to land an exclusive on one Mad Men-style success...).</p>
<p>To Netflix customers who mostly think of the service as a way to get movies, I can understand why today's move seems dumb. &nbsp;But as someone who mostly thinks of the service as a way to watch television shows, it makes perfect sense. &nbsp;And of course I'm delighted to see a business/tech innovation achieve what the cable/satellite market and federal regulation could not: a la carte programming and the consignment of cable network operators to a bulk-bandwidth-vending fate (I've been saying for a while that the natural monopoly implied by the physical realities of cable systems means that they ought to wind up as utilities, every bit as boring and regulated as the water company; I think the net neutrality fight is best understood as the death throes of an industry that, understandably, doesn't want to be in a commodity business).</p>
<p>I think that this shift means that your Netflix bill will inevitably get more complicated as new option plans are made available. &nbsp;That by itself is a pretty good reason for isolating the DVD-by-mail side of things; those customers want different things, and the situation was already getting confusing. &nbsp;And I think the move really will free the company to concentrate more on the streaming product (I expect that they'll soon be pushing for more uniformity in the interfaces to the service that various integrated media solutions provide, for instance). The poisonous rage of the network operators that carry those streaming products' bits remains a real threat, but if Comcast &amp; co. can be successfully coaxed into a gentle senescence, I think the future of a net-only Netflix is bright.</p>
<p><strong>INCIDENTALLY:</strong> I think all of this can be understood as a huge indictment of Apple. &nbsp;Not that iTunes hasn't been a big success, but they're&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.macworld.com/article/161983/2011/08/apple_axes_tv_show_rentals_for_itunes_apple_tv.html">retreating</a> from the rental/streaming market. &nbsp;They never quite managed to move past thinking of the service as a content-supplier/&quot;we have legal content!&quot; validator for Apple hardware products, nor to meaningfully relax their quality standards (well, except for the iTunes software, of course) in order to compete for the market segment Netflix pursued. It's ludicrous that new receivers don't come with big &quot;iTunes-ready!&quot; stickers on it; that stereo equipment manufacturers have to play catch-up, <em>begging</em> Apple to let them provide iPod support. It's flat-out insane that Airplay is a closed standard, its proprietary nature used to help prop up a consumer router business. &nbsp;A fucking consumer router business! &nbsp;If ever there was a market you wouldn't want to be in... At any rate, it's a reminder that even Apple misses occasional opportunities. &nbsp;And note that I say all this as a mostly-satisfied Apple TV owner. &nbsp;They settled for a lucrative niche when entertainment industry world domination was within their grasp.</p>

<p>But I'm not sure that &quot;gamification is bullshit&quot;, as Bogost maintains. &nbsp;After spending an hour with someone who works for Zynga, I'm convinced it's not that at all. &nbsp;Here's what it is: price discrimination plus a radical version of behaviorial economics. &nbsp;It's the further weaponization of marketing's insights into consumer behavior. It isn't just something dreamed up by morons from the marketing department--it's actually much more frightening than that.</p>

                    <p>I mostly really like The Awl these days -- contra <a class="reference external" href="http://www.quinnnorton.com/said/?p=559">Quinn</a>, I think the site started strong, had a rough patch, and now is back to publishing a lot of great stuff. <a class="reference external" href="http://www.theawl.com/2011/08/was-aaron-swartz-stealing">But this is not a very good article</a>. It's credulous about things that call for skepticism, and skeptical about things that are perfectly reasonable.</p>
<blockquote>
A lot of people seem to believe that it doesn't cost anything to make documents available online, but that is absolutely not so. Yes, you can digitize an academic journal and put it online, but if you mean to offer reliable, permanent availability, it costs a huge amount of money just to keep up with the entropy. Plus you have to index the material to make it searchable, not a small job. Everything has to be backed up. When a hard drive fries, when servers or database software become obsolete or break down, when new anti-virus software is required, all this stuff requires a stable and permanent infrastructure and that does not come cheap. Finally, the more traffic you have, the more it costs to maintain fast, uninterrupted server access; you can see this whenever some little blog is mentioned in a newspaper and its server crashes five seconds later. In the case of JSTOR you are looking at many millions of hits every month, and they can't afford any mistakes.</blockquote>
<p>Actually, <a class="reference external" href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3/#pricing">all this stuff really is pretty cheap</a>. And then there's the other nice thing about the internet: digital content of genuine utility can be more-or-less counted on to self-perpetuate. &nbsp;Release a valuable DRM-free file onto the network and its preservation <em>somewhere</em> is more or less funded automatically by the people who exchange it.&nbsp;Besides, costs continue to fall while the size of scanned documents remains constant.</p>
<p>It's true to some extent that dealing with large-scale distribution and managing bitrot in any particular centralized location does involve costs. &nbsp;So it's not that JSTOR doesn't need money. &nbsp;It's more that we don't need JSTOR.</p>
<blockquote>
There are nearly 19,000 documents in this 33GB download [of out-of-copyright JSTOR documents uploaded in protest by Greg Maxwell], and anyone can take them off The Pirate Bay—and then what? It will tax an ordinary home computer quite a lot to search just this one file, the archives of a single journal of the 1,400-plus currently distributed by JSTOR; that's the tiniest drop in the bucket. The practical futility of Maxwell's gesture only demonstrates that JSTOR is providing an invaluable service to the public, even with respect to documents in the public domain—one that could be improved upon, maybe, but completely impossible for individuals to duplicate using existing technologies.</blockquote>
<p>This is just flat-out wrong. Someone who knows what they're doing will need to OCR those PDFs and dump the results into Solr or something like it, but the actual language-to-be-searched will be a fraction of that 33GB total. &nbsp;This was a big but tractable problem for a home computer a decade ago. &nbsp;Today it's basically trivial; my rough guess is that the task is on par with searching through a decade's worth of email. &nbsp;Besides which, people who actually need this data -- researchers, for instance -- can deal with not-that-much-more-inaccessible tools to get at it.</p>
<p>I'm sure JSTOR's system is impressive. &nbsp;But you know what? &nbsp;There are a lot of people on the internet who can build impressive systems, and many of them are willing to do so and make the results available for free if it's for a halfway decent cause.</p>
<blockquote>
It seems far more likely that if he meant to distribute any JSTOR articles on a file-sharing site, he would have stripped out any copyrighted material first (1.7 million of the 4.8 million articles he downloaded, according to the indictment.) That would be child's play for someone like Swartz to do, and it would certainly have decreased his chances of landing in the soup.</blockquote>
<p>Spoken like someone who's never had to figure out if a document is in copyright (much less do so programmatically). Unless JSTOR had already done the work of figuring this out, it would've actually been a very difficult task. &nbsp;That 1.7 million number is likely representative of documents that can be positively said to be in copyright. &nbsp;It is much harder to positively say that something is out of copyright.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Still,&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/60353785/Untitled?secret_password=1pnh76ns7nc9cnonp1sg#full">the government's indictment alleges</a> that he intended to distribute the stuff to the public &quot;through one or more file-sharing sites,&quot; without offering any details as to why they think he was going to do that. If they hope to prove this allegation based solely on the 2008 Guerrilla Open Access Manifesto, it would seem that they have got an uphill climb.</p>
<p>For one thing, Swartz has been working for years on analyzing huge data sets at Harvard and elsewhere. He has a longstanding professional interest in the study of large data sets. Sure, it's a little bit fishy that he didn't use the network at his home institution in order to access JSTOR. If the allegations in the indictment are true, it would also appear that Swartz took steps to cover his tracks in order to escape detection. I could think of a zillion possible reasons for this with one lobe tied behind my back: Did Swartz want to keep the nature of his work secret from a colleague for some professional reason? Had the Harvard IT department refused to permit him to take that much data down?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't really know what to say about this other than it seems like a stretch to me. &nbsp;Occam, etc.</p>
<p>From that point on, the article is actually pretty good, discussing the strangeness of the government's decision to indict, the specific charges being brought, and ending with a very nice wrapup that appropriately and respectfully invokes Lessig and Malamud. &nbsp;Still, while you all know I'm usually as cranky as anyone about internet utopianism, it really is the case that digital technology is both incredibly powerful and incredibly cheap. &nbsp;JSTOR and the journals are more rentiers than humble archivists struggling to cover costs.</p>

                    <p>I am now substantially de-jetlagged! &nbsp;Let's get this published quickly, then deal with the chaos of my inbox.</p>
<p>Matt was nice enough to <a class="reference external" href="http://thinkprogress.org/yglesias/2011/06/19/248045/campaign-spending-and-broadcast-media/">respond</a>; if you haven't already seen it, you should go read it. A few quick things, presented in bullet form because I think trying to write narrative transitions often gets me in trouble:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Matt's right that broadcast spending matters most at the top, of course. &nbsp;I would suggest, though, that this affects many if not all other levels of office, as politicians feel obligated to give to one another in order to reify and ascend their parties' hierarchies.</li>
<li>When discussing broadcast media, I really meant to do so in the context of independent expenditures. &nbsp;It was foolish of me to link to the Obama campaign's spending breakdown -- that gesture, intended to convey the staggering scale of communications costs, mostly just confused the issue. &nbsp;The point I wanted to make was that restricting speech that affects a race but which is made by an entity other than one of the candidates' campaigns is thorny, but perhaps not as thorny as we pretend: the mediums of expression that are most relevant to this problem aren't, shouldn't and never will be places were we can guarantee perfectly free speech.</li>
<li>Still, I admit I probably emphasized broadcast more than it deserved simply because it was rhetorically convenient for me. &nbsp;I don't know if there are SuperPACs paying for (non-coordinated!) GOTV efforts -- I suspect that campaigns wouldn't like that idea, but who knows. But I'm sure that plenty of them are paying for direct mail, which is immune to the critiques I leveled at broadcast media. And I've read some decently compelling evidence that campaign professionals consider broadcast media and direct mail to be substitutable.</li>
<li>As for spending by campaigns themselves: I suppose I'd personally be open to the idea of providing a <a class="reference external" href="http://thinkprogress.org/yglesias/2011/06/19/248158/only-15-percent-of-virginia-house-of-delegates-seats-are-being-contested/">floor</a> of support for candidates, but I wonder how much of a difference it'd make. &nbsp;It would be silly to extend the analogy very far, but in some other culturally important areas, revenue sharing sure seems less helpful at generating healthy competition than salary caps have been. &nbsp;Besides which, it seems like more robust electoral competition is something you'd pursue to make elected officials more representative of the electorate's views. &nbsp;To the extent that this is a problem at all, my impression is that institutional structure is the bigger culprit.</li>
<li>I've heard various political science professors endorse variations of &quot;the more politics the better!&quot; but this has always struck me as pretty silly -- either&nbsp;a manifestation of a fairly pathetic urge to be counted the most cynical, counterintuitive and therefore sophisticated guy in the room; or an overextension of the term &quot;politics&quot; to encompass every aspect of every democratic system for reconciling conflicting claims, to the extent that the term loses much of its meaning.</li>
</ul>
<p>Maybe this is horribly consequentialist, but for me it really comes down to this: for several reasons it strikes me as deeply unwise to put our working legislators on a&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2010/12/voinovich_spills_the_beans_sen.html">constant fundraising treadmill</a> (particularly given our legislative institutions' other tendencies toward&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2010/12/21/keeping-congress-competent-staff-pay-turnover-and-what-it-means-for-democracy/">self-lobotimization</a>). Yet that's where we've found ourselves. &nbsp;Efforts to untangle this problem quickly run afoul of speech rights. &nbsp;But the speech rights in question almost invariably belong to people who wield incredible financial, social and political power. &nbsp;What's more, the rights in question tend to be concerned with the amplification of those individuals' speech in forums that are not and will never be available to most people, rather than rights associated with getting one's message across some threshold of discoverability.</p>
<p>My principled friends will be aghast, but the idea of trampling on that particular subset of super-speech rights bothers me basically not at all. &nbsp;Sure, I would prefer a solution to this dilemma that arrives in a neatly-packaged, internally consistent collection of philosophical and legal thought. &nbsp;But if I can't have that, I will be content with something that wades through the pragmatically-minded muck along with much of the rest of our system.</p>
<p>(For the record, I would be happy to support a compromise that allows unlimited political contributions in support of speech that takes the form of&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://ronpaulblimp.com/">blimps</a>)</p>

                    <p>There's no way to write this post without seeming like I'm just being a shill for my employer. And yet, as I write it, I need to be careful to point out that I am <em>not speaking on behalf of my employer</em>, and could easily get myself in trouble for posting it. Really, this is all downside for me.</p>
<p>But in the last week a couple of friends have written posts that begin, more or less, with &quot;Given that campaign finance legislation is fundamentally incompatible with the first amendment...&quot; And look, yes, I know that this is, if not the legal status quo, then at least what awaits us at the bottom of the legal slip and slide that our juridical institutions are gleefully hurtling down. But let me be the lame parent worrying about what all this water will do to the lawn: I still don't buy that money is speech.</p>
<p>It's probably necessary to look at this from a couple of angles. First, there's the case in which money is given to someone else in order to support that candidate or cause's speech. Our campaign finance laws remain relatively strong in this area, and understandably so: if it's not <em>my</em> speech, my speech rights aren't (as) relevant. Handing you a pen is not speech; neither is handing you a dollar to buy a pen.</p>
<p>The situation is admittedly more difficult in cases where we're talking about restricting individuals' ability to spend on their own expressions when those expressions benefit particular candidates or political outcomes. In a theoretical sense, I get it. It's an intractable problem. That pen might amount to a precondition to self-expression for you, making it, from a practical perspective, indistinguishable from the act of expression itself. If we can't summon the political will to guarantee everyone access to pens, we can sure as hell not start drafting pen-control laws and asking Staples cashiers to enforce them (in the case of the FEC, this is a generous metaphorical comparison).</p>
<p>I love philosophical abstractions as much as the next guy, but let's get real: most types of communication are cheap. <a class="reference external" href="http://www.opensecrets.org/pres08/expend.php?cycle=2008&amp;cid=n00009638">This is about broadcast media</a>. The money-in-politics discussion is about domination of a small number of more-or-less zero-sum distribution channels, most of which are subject to physical constraints that necessitate a high level of regulation. Your freedom to speak within these channels is already severely limited in both a <a class="reference external" href="http://transition.fcc.gov/eb/oip/">legal</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.google.com/search?q=nbc+won't+air+ad">practical</a> sense.</p>
<p>I think we ought to distinguish between advertising and speech. I think everyone's got a right to express what they believe and to see if it can convince others. I don't think the right to force your message in front of others' eyeballs is nearly so sacrosanct. It used to be pretty difficult to disentangle these two things, but every hour we spend marching deeper into the digital age makes the distinction clearer.</p>
<p>Or so it seems to me, anyway. I'm not claiming that our existing set of campaign finance laws is coherent; I'm not claiming that engineering a legally defensible alternative would be easy (though I have some ideas, many of them admittedly involving a jackboot on the throat of television ad sales executives). But I do think that the conversation about money's role in politics needs to be tied more closely to a conversation about broadcast media's role in politics. Personally, I think the latter is both a huge waste of resources and a wellspring of perverse incentives for politicians and the electorate. And I don't think it deserves to hide within the aegis of rights that we quite correctly treat with reverence.</p>

                    <p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.slate.com/id/2295413/">Cute trick, but this is no good</a>. Sure, I overuse the em dash -- anyone who's read anything I've written will quickly learn that truth about me. But I think the linked column betrays an impoverished conception of writing. Call it Editor's Disease: the written word as its own artifact (or, worse, as precursor to embodiment in A Font About Which Editor Has Strong Opinions). If your thoughts stray to subjects like kerning before your composition is complete, I think you're doing something wrong. If your goal in writing is to create clean, efficient prose, well, great, but personally I value those qualities in the consumer electronics I purchase, not the things I read.</p>
<p>I like to think of text as a convenient embodiment of speech, and the speech I most like to record aspires to being a witty, conversational and perhaps slightly tipsy soliloquy. Real human speech is not only full of asides, but is most effective when it's delivered with a sense of timing. Em dashes are great for satisfying both of those requirements, largely because of the flexibility acknowledge by the article.</p>

                    <p>If you're in the market for project management software -- and it seems like a large portion of people working on the internet perpetually are -- let me encourage you to check out my cousin Sophia's startup, <a class="reference external" href="http://webplanner.com/pages/index.php">Webplanner</a>. I am admittedly not the world's biggest Silverlight fan, but the software seems to do a nice job of actually having something to do with projects and how they are executed (as opposed to, say, Pivotal, which has always struck me as a more awful videogame than bug tracker), while not being quite as stripped-down-to-the-point-of-frustration as Basecamp.

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>I was glad to see <a class="reference external" href="http://timothyblee.com/2011/05/16/stephen-colberts-confused-parody-of-citizens-united/">Tim writing about Stephen Colbert's decision to start a PAC</a>. At work we've been excited to have such a high-profile figure talking about the campaign finance system -- excited enough to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sunlightfoundation/sets/72157626713576460/">dress people in bear costumes</a>, in fact.</p>
<p>But I don't think Tim gives Colbert enough credit. Yes, there are tensions within Colbert's efforts that are related to speech rights. But it's a mistake to expect Colbert to be perfectly logically consistent. I think his aim is to point out absurdities within our system -- absurdities that are to some extent the product of the contradictions Tim mentions. This undertaking can be done -- and can be useful -- without offering a solution.</p>
<p>Tim's critique also ignores the issue of disclosure, which is central to Colbert's focus on <em>Citizens United</em>, and which is the motivation behind his pursuit of a media exemption. I'm sympathetic to arguments about the importance of preserving avenues for anonymous political speech. But a good case can also be made that it is reasonable to expect those who avail themselves of privileged mediums of expression to stand by the statements they make in them. In practice if not in law I would face different obligations for a statement I whispered to a friend versus one I slapped on a billboard. I think that's reasonable.</p>
<p>Finally, Tim's post sidesteps the thorniest questions associated with distinguishing corporate speech from speech made by humans. He rightly observes that &quot;this isn't how free speech jurisprudence works&quot;, but I find that argument more depressing than compelling. The personhood question is so dreary and vast that I'm hesitant to bring it up here. But when it comes to political speech, the same culpability two-step is very much in play: like Dr. Jekyll trying to cordone his negative impulses in a separate entity, the division between an active, proudly amoral leadership and the slumbering ownership whose authority they exert often leads to bad outcomes. I think it's telling that defenders of corporate money in our system can't brook the idea of requiring that the owners of that money be forced to approve its use for political ends. It puts the lie to their protestations that corporate giving is simply a vehicle for expressing individuals' speech rights collectively.</p>
<p>Clearly, political and legal momentum are not on the side of people who feel the way I do. But our system has long acknowledged these tensions in its prohibition on direct giving from corporations to politicians. That PACs can and do launder this kind of money doesn't validate the practice.</p>
<p>Tim's point is that some of our society's legal traditions and most cherished principles demand that we not restrict corporate speech. Colbert's point is that those principles are forcing us to further empower inhuman actors whose influence on our political system may imperil our society, and perhaps even our planet. I don't think either side is wrong.</p>

<p>You have to sort of admire the brazenness of this threat. I mean really: that's astounding.</p>
<p>I guess I've seen enough frightening ads on Metro to be convinced that this really is just a transfer from banks to merchants. But hey, that seems okay! Particularly given banks' ongoing profitability relative to everyone else, their continued lack of punishment, and the concentration in the payment processing market.</p>
<p>Besides, won't merchants just turn right around and send that money into the supposedly-loss-leading (but I suspect just loss-???ing) &quot;online coupon site&quot; bubble, which will then <a class="reference external" href="http://mashable.com/2011/04/13/livingsocial-1-dollar-lunches/">distribute it to consumers</a> during whatever time is left between now and the conclusion of that sector's frantic race to the bottom?

<p>That seems to me to be the interesting part. &nbsp;Because while a lot of people are going on about the crappiness of the video, it seems clear that this would not have become the internet meme it is unless it crossed <em>some</em> threshold for plausibly professional production (embarrassing webcam karaoke might be mocked, but not to this degree). &nbsp;Certainly when I first saw the video last weekend, having never heard of Rebecca Black, I simply assumed that she was some new tween sensation whose handlers had created an unutterably condescending and awful new product to sell to prepubescent dopes.</p>
<p>But it turns out that the video is basically a high-class version of the karaoke booths at Six Flags where you can pay to be videotaped in front of a green screen. &nbsp;Sure, the edge-detection effect that opens the video is lame, and all the fake depth of field stuff is off-putting, and the autotuning is obvious. &nbsp;But isn't it... believable? &nbsp;Isn't it kind of amazing how well a fly-by-night effects company was able to ape what was the state of the art in pop music videos not so long ago? &nbsp;Perhaps I'm wrong about the costs, but the utter disposability of the song -- and Black's acknowledgement that she didn't like it even while recording it -- indicates that this was not a huge investment for her family. &nbsp;In other words: I suspect we're looking at a budget in the low single-digit thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>Maybe I'm wrong and this is a case of fantastically rich parents and/or some strange social failure that forestalled any effort at quality control. &nbsp;But preliminarily, I'm pretty impressed by the level of polish that can now be achieved without -- clearly -- anybody involved being able to muster the enthusiasm to give a damn.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>I guess it's serendipity that&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/2011/03/huckabee-romney-and-the-beast/">this post</a> showed up over at Yglesias's blog this morning. &nbsp;It discusses a paper that argues that deficits actually lead to more demand for government, as shifting costs to the future lowers the public's sense of the cost of government services, prompting them to consume more. &nbsp;This doesn't seem very controversial to me (or at least I'm not qualified to say anything interesting about it).</p>
<p>But just yesterday I was thinking about something very similar in the context of the <a class="reference external" href="http://arstechnica.com/software/news/2011/03/twitter-tells-third-party-devs-to-stop-making-twitter-client-apps.ars">current storm</a> over Twitter. &nbsp;Not so much because of the specific question of how much Twitter client variety we'll see, but the larger question of the firm beginning to make decisions that will help it generate revenue rather than decisions that will help it generate user adoption.</p>
<p>And it occurred to me that we basically debt finance our social networks. &nbsp;There are a&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://pinboard.in/signup/">few</a> <a class="reference external" href="http://www.metafilter.com/newuser.mefi">exceptions</a>, but in general nobody's willing to pay for social experiences on the web. &nbsp;So instead we've arrived at a model where open registration, open APIs and open bars at SXSW are used to attract users. &nbsp;Then, once network effects have given the experience value, and so long as transition costs remain inconveniently high, value can be extracted from those users. &nbsp;Lots of people tell lots of stories about how this can be a positive-sum interaction (usually fairytales about how valuable anonymous usage data is, or how people will suddenly start enjoying the experience of looking at ads if the sales pitch is sufficiently personalized). &nbsp;But in practice it seems to always be the case that user experience is degraded in some way.</p>
<p>This isn't a particularly great insight, I suppose: that you can goose demand if you shift costs into the future. &nbsp;Discount rates exist; it's why economists fret about declines in consumer borrowing. &nbsp;It's why people still smoke cigarettes.</p>
<p>I have an aesthetic aversion to it -- a general sense that things would be <em>better</em> if costs were presented up front. &nbsp;That it would be preferable for Twitter to be a protocol like email rather than a service like Facebook. &nbsp;Maybe even that it would be more&nbsp;<em>moral</em> for them to be. &nbsp;That the costs associated with transitioning between social networks every, what, five years are high enough to be worth complaining about.*</p>
<p>But this is probably is just a meaningless prejudice on part. &nbsp;Twitter wouldn't have become Twitter if those costs had been apparent from the start. &nbsp;To wish it could be otherwise is just to say that you want foolish angel investors to buy you toys for free**. &nbsp;The service will probably remain fine for a long time, and then it'll get worse, and we'll all bitch about it and eventually something else will come along.</p>
<p>I just hope that when Google finally decides it needs to make some money off Gmail that they have the class to ask me for it to my face instead of creating some privacy-violating Rube Goldberg device by which other corporations agree to exchange money for making my life very slightly worse, as if I was plugged into the Matrix to power cybernetic tyrants with my mild irritation.</p>
<p>* Whatever this inclination is, it's closely related to the sense I have that mobile vendors shouldn't use contracts to subsidize handsets, and that cable TV should be a la carte, and that bandwidth should be billed on a metered basis. &nbsp;In all cases these &quot;innovations&quot; probably facilitate commercial activity that's desirable, but I'd be happy enough to see it disappear simply to avoid the sense that people are being duped. &nbsp;I guess it's just pique.</p>
<p>** To be clear, I'm in favor of this.</p>

                    <p>My grandfather was no slouch: he was a Rhodes Scholar and had successful careers in the foreign service and pharmaceutical industry. &nbsp;But that's not what I remember him for. &nbsp;Instead I think about his absent-minded professorial air; his tendency to try to repair everything with epoxy; his fondness for hollering out <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aura_Lea">Aura Lee</a> after too many sherries; his kindness, which was so profound that it -- and it alone -- could bridge the bitterness of his kids' divorces. &nbsp;Part of the reason these traits took the foreground was that he was by nature a humble guy. &nbsp;But a big part was that he happily shared a stage with my grandmother.</p>
<p>She was an incredibly impressive woman -- possessed of a forceful mind, a New Englander's unshakable belief in liberal values, and a sharp sense of humor. &nbsp;Recently my aunt sent me an interview that she'd just discovered, in which my grandmother spoke frankly about her life as a foreign service officer's wife (very much a career in its own right); her experiences being stationed in Senegal, New Zealand, Australia, Jamaica, Iceland and Belgium; her sense of Europeans' comparative drinking habits; and our family's run-in with some of the worst of the McCarthy era. &nbsp;I think it captures a lot of what made her so great. &nbsp;Maybe it won't be of interest to anyone else, but believe me: if you'd known her, you'd be rapt.</p>

<p><em>The Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training Foreign Affairs Oral History Program Foreign Service Spouse Series</em></p>
<p>Interviewed by: Jewell Fenzi and Patricia Squire</p>
<p>Initial interview date: May 30, 1990</p>
<p>LEE: Before you're allowed to vote in Vermont, you take the &quot;freeman's oath,&quot; and there's a feeling in the state that everybody is equal to everybody else. I knew nothing about the Foreign Service, and when I entered it, in the year 1941, and discovered how hierarchical it was, and the whole system extended to wives who were expected to work for their country for nothing and were placed under the bidding and supervision of &quot;more superior&quot; wives, I thought the whole thing was simply abhorrent.</p>
<p>I wasn't bothered at the first post, Toronto, which was a trading post. The chief of mission, the Consul General, interested me because he was an Edwardian snob and I had never met one, outside of literature. I thought he was vaguely amusing, and his wife was a rather gentle lady for whom I felt some compassion. And some of the senior wives were very kind to me and spared my feelings, so I didn't suffer too much.</p>
<p>But as I look back on it, I realize that it was a very unhappy post. At that time there was a distinction between the career and non-career services, and he made a bloody distinction between the two services. Several people drank too much at that post; one man committed suicide. It was an unhappy post and the values of the senior officer just poor, meretricious. My husband kept saying, &quot;Oh, you mustn't judge the Foreign Service by this, just wait till we get our next post.&quot;</p>
<p>We were commissioned in March 1942, so this was very early after we entered World War II. I was packing mobile libraries for the Imperial Order of Daughters of the Empire before we entered the war. A rather amusing incident: as I was packing away busily down at their main headquarters, I heard somebody ask, &quot;Who is she?&quot; I realized they were referring to me. The other woman said, &quot;She's an American.&quot; There was a pause, then the first lady said, &quot;You know, you can't trust them. They invaded us once and they'll do it again.&quot; (hearty laughter)</p>
<p>Well, war was declared and then there was this problem with the last class at the Foreign Service. They were frozen. Armistead was frozen in along with other members of his class and no more young men were taken in, they all had to be taken into the armed forces.</p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): So since he was frozen into the Foreign Service, they couldn't take him into the military?</em></p>
<p>LEE: That's right. But they felt it was only fair for these young men who were frozen in to send them to about the most unpleasant posts they could think of, which I think was probably fair enough. And the post they picked for Army was Dakar, in what was then French West Africa, now Senegal. He was to go in a convoy. By this time I was pregnant and what every young woman did during this period was to go home to mother and father, and it never occurred to any of us that they weren't wildly happy to have us. (both laugh heartily)</p>
<p>I went up to Vermont where my father, by now retired, was running the family farm, and Armistead went to Washington. They discussed his situation and my pregnancy and finally decided -- the baby was due early in November -- to give him compassionate leave of two weeks, which was very nice. So he came up to Westford, and every morning when I appeared at breakfast, three pairs of eyes looked at me accusingly. Nothing happened. His two weeks were used up and he had to go back to Newport News to the convoy. It was rather ticklish because this particular convoy had been sunk on its last trip across the Atlantic. I still produced no baby.</p>
<p>Just at that time the most ferocious snowstorm that Vermont had ever had early in November came, and the Westfortown fathers had neglected to fix an important part of the snowplow; which doesn't sound like Vermont, but this [was] what happened. So the snow snowed up to the windows and over part of them, the most depressing snowstorm I've ever seen. I called my obstetrician, who said, &quot;Well, if you can't get out, I'll phone in the instructions.&quot; My mother said, weakly, &quot;To whom?&quot; (hearty laughs)</p>
<p>Neighbors called and said, &quot;We'll get ox teams out, we'll do everything to get her out.&quot; But for three days I was caught there. Fortunately the baby remained quiet. On the last day they got the snowplow fixed and I went out in a sort of cortege -- there were l4 milk trucks and a great big dump truck from Si Parree [phonetic] and I was in the front seat with him, he evidently terrified that I was going to have the baby en route to Burlington. But we got there all right. Indeed I was there two days before the baby came.</p>
<p>At the very last minute, just as the convoy was going to shove off, Armistead called from the ship: he'd asked permission and the captain said, &quot;I'm sitting here with my gun and if you make one false move I'll shoot you.&quot; He had been sunk in a convoy previously and was taking no chances. So Armi called. He couldn't reach the house but of course everybody was on the same telephone line in Westford, Vermont, and somebody spoke up and said, &quot;I think you'll find her aunt at home.&quot; He called my aunt and explained who he was and she was able to tell him that our daughter had been born. And he went off to Africa.</p>
<p>I stayed in Vermont until the baby was about 11 months old. I was making plans to get to Dakar, and nobody during war times was allowed to fly out of the United States unless you were military. There were all kinds of difficulties -- I couldn't even get my shots for yellow fever and all the other things you had to have for Africa. I had to go down to 90 Church Street in New York City, so I went down and stayed with a sister-in-law who lived in New Jersey, my brother then being back in Washington in the Navy. I was nursing the baby, she was then about three months old, and then would race into the city. If there wasn't too much brass ahead of me, I would get my shots and race back in time to feed the baby.</p>
<p>Then I had to arrange to send out baby food. So I was in communication with baby food manufacturers. The rules forbade glass jars because they didn't want to pack glass; it was very difficult to get metal jars because of the war. Finally I was able to order l,300 cans of assorted baby food and breathed a sigh of relief and thought, &quot;Well, we're getting things cleared away.&quot; Armi's last words had been, &quot;It's going to be a cinch your getting to Africa.&quot; (they laugh heartily)</p>
<p>The telephone rang one day. It was the salesman I'd worked with on baby food. He said, &quot;There's been a little glitch on the baby food. We can produce the l,300 cans but they're all spinach.&quot; (both break down; after a while she resumes) I said, &quot;You have to be kidding.&quot; And we had an exchange of some rather hot words, and he said, &quot;Well, I'll go back and see what I can do.&quot; I finally did get the baby food and it was sent off to Africa.</p>
<p>When it arrived -- Dakar was a very &quot;wartime post&quot; -- the wife of the British I don't know what his status was but she was the ranking wife, saw on the bill of lading that these puréed things had come in and she said, &quot;Oh goody, we'll make soups out of them.&quot; So she began to work out of my baby food before Armistead was able to discover that the food had arrived and could stop it. We lost some cans that way.</p>
<p>Finally I got passage on the first ship allowed out, a neutral Portuguese ship bound for Lisbon. From Lisbon I could get a plane to Dakar. The ship was the Lorenzo Mark[phon. sp.]; they'd been about to scuttle her when the War broke out and saved her. They charged an enormous amount of money, it was dreadful, and I had arranged with them that there would be baby food on board, and canned milk, everything was just fine. And I got down to the ship and discovered they had no baby food on board and no tinned milk whatsoever. (she laughs) So I flew to the phone. Armistead had a cousin who lived near Newport News. I explained the situation. It was SundaHe said, &quot;I know a grocer, I'll get in and come down on the dock.&quot; Sure enough, about four hours later sirens screamed and military police were saying, &quot;Hey, you can't go there&quot; and Blair Lee came down. He had baby food, he had a strainer, a can opener, milk, (laughing) he had everything. My child was the only one who didn't have dysentery and wasn't sick on this 17-day voyage across the Atlantic.</p>
<p>We were nighted of course and proceeded very calmly and slowly. Wahwee MacArthur, Ambassador MacArthur's wife -- she was Alben Barkley's daughter, the wife of (I believe) a Third Secretary, I'm not sure -- dressed somewhat like a retired spy but she was very pleasant. I was quite unprepared for her apotheosis when she became the Ambassador's wife and became so desperately unpleasant.</p>
<p>We just sort of sat it out. The food on board was terrible. When I got to Lisbon we were about to disembark, I was packing, little Norie, who had a tendency to put things in her mouth -- you remember the round dental-floss holder? -- she swallowed it before I could stop her and it caught in her throat. She started to turn blue. All I could think of was, &quot;I've brought this baby this far and I'll have a dead child for Africa.&quot; I tried to dislodge it, I tipped her upside down, my hand was in her throat, and then I started up the stairs to the ship's doctor. He was a little perfumed rather dark Portuguese gentleman. I roared into his office and just as I got in a flood came down the front of me and the thing came out of her throat. I said there with this screaming child and the nice little man patted me. &quot;I'll give you something, Mrs. Lee,&quot; he said, &quot;the baby's all right.&quot; I've always remembered him with great affection.</p>
<p>BUT I was not looking like a very chic Foreign Service wife. The mother of Lisa Green, the wife of our Ambassador to Portugal, was down at the dock to meet us, (she stops for hearty laughing) which I thought was very bad luck. Mrs. Crocker was down there. Well, we were sort of newsworthy, because we were the first boat that had come across, I guess. I was feeling rather miserable. Suddenly a voice spoke from the dock. &quot;Are you Eleanore Lee?&quot; I said that I was. &quot;Well, your husband has sent me to look after you.&quot; This was a young man from the Embassy who had some reason to go to Dakar, and Armi said, &quot;By the way, my wife's coming through.&quot; Well, this paragon took me to the hotel, speaking fluent Portuguese. He had a maid who loved babies, he took me around Lisbon, and he got me on the plane for Dakar.</p>
<p>That was no small feat: the State Department had made an error in my papers and there was the fine little bureaucrat at the airport who said, &quot;She can't go without this paper!&quot; He argued and cajoled and got me on the plane.</p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): Was he in the Foreign Service?</em></p>
<p>LEE: Well, yes and no. He was a legal type. Armi nearly died when I explained one of my conversations with the young man. He asked me what I thought of the FBI. It was dealing, I thought rather unjustly, with people who were being accused of being &quot;unAmerican&quot; or &quot;Communists.&quot; So I let fly about the FBI and explained that I didn't think they used very good judgment. Armi said, &quot;Didn't you know that legal attachés were invariably FBI?&quot; (both laugh heartily) It didn't seem to make any difference, he still was very nice to me.</p>
<p>When I boarded the Clipper [plane] ship this nice American boy said, &quot;Give me the baby, she got a bottle, I'll give it to her.&quot; And when we arrived at Dakar, of course I had to go through a battery of French officials. One of them said, &quot;Madame Lee, the port is closed with bubonic plague.&quot; Then he looked at my passport, and sai(imitating awed tone of voice) &quot;Ah, Madame, you have a diplomatic passport. Entrez!&quot; So our first trip was to the Air Force Hospital. Actually one reason why we felt that I could come with the baby was because there was a very good American Air Force hospital there.</p>
<p>Dakar had a great deal of misery, I saw elephantiasis and leprosy and just terrible illness and wretchedness there. But there were several doctors at the American hospital who wanted to be baby doctors and hadn't seen babies for a long time, so we got very good attention.</p>
<p>We settled into a little house across from the Consulate General. It was rather better furnished than most houses in Dakar then. Our predecessor had won two chairs in poker game on a ship, leather chairs still with the bolts on that bolted them down. And Armi had made a sofa out of a car seat with a Mauretanian blanket. So we were rather spiffy. We had a dining room table and I think five or six chairs that matched it; I don't recall where they came from.</p>
<p>I remember the first party we gave, the whole doorway, screen and all, fell over the entering guests' head. The termites had eaten it. When it rained, we had to wear rubbers to get from the front of the house into the sleeping quarters because the roof had never been fixed. Now and then I read things from home about cookie-pushers in the Foreign Service having this life of terrible eas(laughing) while the rest of the world was wracked with pain.</p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): Was this as amusing at the time as it is now?</em></p>
<p>LEE: Well, I didn't mind this very much. I can remember pushing Norie early in the morning in a pram and thinking, &quot;What am I doing here, in the heart of Africa?&quot;</p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): You talked about the drums, too.</em></p>
<p>LEE: Yes. In the Medina you'd hear the drums. It was a little bit menacing. There was a marvelous beach at Yaw.... where occasionally we could go. They had an enormous black swimmer there, he must have been six feet six, whom the Army hired to watch -- the surf was terrific and if you got too far out he would race out and get you. It was a beautiful place.</p>
<p>Our Consul General, who is now dead, was a really dreadful man. This was my second experiencwith [an Edwardian snob]! (finishing the sentence with a laugh) He hated the tropics, they really made him feel quite unreal. He drank a great deal. He disliked blacks intensely, he didn't like the French much; and there he was.</p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): Sounds like an ideal choice for Dakar.</em></p>
<p>LEE: So Dakar was a great post for him. He was intemperate and choleric. When I was offered a chance to teach in a lycée, they'd been without one for a long time. And I didn't dream of asking for money, I'd learned that you mustn't have any money for what you did in the Foreign Service. It was a volunteer position. Mr. Wilkinson called me over and said, &quot;I can't keep you from taking this job but I'll break your husband if you take it.&quot;</p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): This was a volunteer job, teaching English in a French school.</em></p>
<p>LEE: That's right.</p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): Why did he feel so strongly?</em></p>
<p>LEE: Well, I don't think he liked women. He had been married. Halways referred to his wife as &quot;that wretched woman &quot;. He had had a mistress in Germany, been utterly happy in Germany, the Germans knew how to run things properly. I think that he just felt he wasn't going to allow anything he didn't want; he was boss. Five people at that post paid their way to get home and out from under him. He was really a pretty dreadful man. There was an awfully nice young naval officer who was an alcoholic who was trying to stay off alcohol, and he tempted him. It made him feel superior to see Dick get drunk. He just was the sort of man who should not have been in the Foreign Service.</p>
<p>The thing that appalled me was that when the inspectors came out -- a very nice inspector came out when I was there, he knew that this was a bad person who shouldn't be in the job -- nothing was done about it.</p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): The old-boy network.</em></p>
<p>LEE: It was the old-boy network, and it just seemed to me that people were allowed to be unpleasant and uncivil and incompetent. When we had official parties -- the mayor of Dakar was a coal-black Senegalese who was a graduate of the Sorbonne, one of the men on the supreme bench whatever they called it was another black -- they were never invited. You can imagine what damage this did to us. So, that was my &quot;second experience.&quot;</p>
<p>Then we were moved to Australia. The first problem with the State Department was, they didn't see why I shouldn't precede Armi and go with a small child to Australia on my own and find a house while he went back and be a consultant at the Department. The Departmen(she laughs) would save a little money. We finally argued them out of that ...</p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): This was right after the war?</em></p>
<p>LEE: Yes. So we took a ship which had been a transport ship of some kind. Marshall and Lisa Greewere on that ship. From the United States, we were going to Australia and they were going to New Zealand. You see, I'd finally said I just wouldn't go to Australia, couldn't possibly; and Armistead raised enough of a shriek so they finally relented. We berthed the ship at New Zealand first en route to Australia and the New Zealand war brides came on in droves. Some of them had babies, they'd been separated from their men who'd gone back to the States to be demobbed, and their parents were there on the dock, weeping, and the girls were crying and the babies were yelling. It was quite a scene. These poor girls finally got on the ship and we got under way. Wishing to be terribly nice to these young women, they ordered up tea for all these young girls. The tea came: lukewarm water and teabags. They burst into tears again! (hearty laughter) I've always remembered that.</p>
<p>So we dropped them off at New Zealand and went on to Australia. We had to go to a hotel, which happened to be a very good one, in downtown Melbourne. We could stay there only three days. It seems to me MacArthur was coming through with an entourage, preempting all the hotel space. After a three-day search we found this obscure place way out in the boondocks. They said they didn't have a crib for the baby, so three of us slept in one bed. It's miraculous how much space a small child takes in a bed -- she had all the bed. I remember it was freezing cold. I finally found a little room with a little fire, and two crones bending over it rubbing their arthritic hands, and one of them saying, &quot;I wouldn't have central heating. It's weakening.&quot; (heavy laughter)</p>
<p>Finally we found a house, we rented one near Heidelberg, a lovely part outside Melbourne, on Brooke Street, with the most marvelous neighbors whom we stayed in touch with all the rest of their lives; most of them are no longer living. A wonderful woman lived across the street who had three children. At that time I had only the one, and I felt that she taught me so much about being a parent. Then a neighbor whom I'd not met called up out of the blue, I thought this was so very Australian, introducing herself on the telephone. She said, &quot;I'd like to give a tea for you&quot; and told me how to reach her house, in walking distance. As I walked up the driveway my heart sank: I smelled coffee, and thought, &quot;I'm afraid she's having coffee for me.&quot; Sure enough, in the dining room there was tea at one end and coffee at the other. &quot;Which will you have, Mrs. Lee?&quot; she asked. Aware that I was a diplomat's wife, I said, &quot;Oh, the coffee. Thank you so much.&quot; It was the most nauseous brew I've ever tasted in my life, and she said, &quot;Will you have another cup?&quot; And doing my best for my country, I said, (breaking up between phrases) &quot;Yes, it's delicious,&quot; and she said, &quot;I do think it's the mustard.&quot; (both break up completely)</p>
<p>She was a marvelous young woman, and she had an en tout cas tennis court and I played tennis there. I discovered these Australian women were born with tennis racquets in their hands and I just had a marvelous time. I remember Australia with so much love and affection. I've often said if I couldn't live in my own country, I'd go back to Australia.</p>
<p>As for the officer in charge, the third one in my life: well, he was civil, really very civil, and his wife was very nice. But I ran into trouble at the very beginning because I was the only career wife there. Before I came, the non-career wives -- this is something people today wouldn't know anything about -- got together. These wives hadn't met me, hadn't heard anything about me, and decided that I would be absolutely impossible. By looking up the book, they found some obscure rule that they could have the chauffeur drop all their cards at the hotel and wouldn't, any of them, follow up. So nobody called on me, and I was alone with a child at this post and nobody called.</p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): And there must have been only a few people.</em></p>
<p>LEE: It wasn't a big post. There were about five of them, and they got together and made decisions. (laughing) When we got into our house, I made personal calls on all these wretched women. They never really liked me. When the new people came in and I met them at train, boat or plane, it was different then. But really our happiness in Australia was because of the Australians.</p>
<p>The Chief of Mission was not really interested in ideas or diplomacy. He was interested in the Foreign Service, and his wife was interested in the protocol. She was really a very sweet woman but I irritateher. I lost a baby because of a miscarriage in Australia. I managed to get pregnant again but the doctor said, &quot;You'd better not stand a lot of time.&quot; So when the Fourth of July thing came along, she wanted Armi and me to stand. I said Armi would love to but the doctor said I'd better not do it. She said, &quot;My dear, it's your country.&quot; I, unfortunately, laughed, it was so absurd, and it hurt her feelings; I was sorry about that.</p>
<p>So that was our third chief officer. I hadn't met anybody, at that point, that I thought was intellectually very stimulating or impressive. And I thought, &quot;What goes in the Foreign Service?&quot; I'd been in, now, about six years. I'd met some junior officers that I thought were really terrific, but I hadn't met anybody &quot;up there.&quot; (she laughs)</p>
<p>Then we went to New Zealand. I was expecting a baby any minute and the doctor had advised the State Department that I should not be moved because of my past history. The State Department said, &quot;It won't hurt her a bit&quot; and moved me. So I had a new doctor and a new hospital and they were righ(she laughs) -- nothing happened. But who was at the plane to meet us? John Stewart Service. Who made our bed and arranged the food in the cupboards in the place we stayed until we got a house? Caroline Service. He was DCM, there being no Ambassador at the moment. So that was my introduction to the Services. Over the years as I look back over all of the people I've known in the Foreign Service, Jack Service was the most intelligent, the most capable, the most wonderful Foreign Service Officer that I ever met. And of course he was crucified by the Service?</p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): Crucified by the Service?</em></p>
<p>LEE: Well, he had a lot of loyal friends but I was thinking of Dulles who came in at the end and used his position to do his best to destroy Jack. No: you're right to correct me, because Jack had many loyal friends but unfortunately they weren't in the highest offices. I don't remember how long the Services were in New Zealand. I think he was transferred to India and she went there with the children, as I recall. Then he was recalled back to Washington to face the charges. That was a very sad period, and you've talked about it with Caroline.</p>
<p>Pretty soon our Ambassador came, Ambassador Scotten. He was not a mental giant. She was fascinating, very chic, with a sort of French glamor, who had evidently grown up with a lot of money and had hardly drawn her own bath water. She came to New Zealand and it was quite a shock. But it was interesting to see -- she was a very intelligent woman, more so I thought than her husband -- and she had a nervous tic and had been having illnesses. Suddenly she called me one day, saying, &quot;I've been asked to give a talk on the League of Women Voters. Can you tell me something about them?&quot; So I told her about the League. Then she was asked to be in a play. She'd never done any of these things and she had a whale of a good time. Her health got better. And she had a very tender heart, she was a very nice person.</p>
<p>That was a very happy post. It was a small Embassy and fortunately everybody liked everybody else. We kept in touch with one another over the years and it worked out very well.</p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): You mentioned curtseying.</em></p>
<p>LEE:(laughing) Oh yes. The representative of the Crown came and a big reception was held at Government House for Governor-General Freiburg, who had been a very fine head of the Anzac forces during the War. He represented the Labor Party, I think. New Zealand is incredibly democratic, wonderfully so. Unfortunately, our Ambassador decided that we should all curtsey. Having grown up in Vermont, and having taken the Freeman's Oath, I said, &quot;I just think this is a very bad idea. We're not servants of the Crown. Curtseying is an act of abasement and we shouldn't do it.&quot; But I was overruled. I gather that a ruling has now been handed down that Americans never do curtsey to Royalty. So I was right! But anyway, I gave a very unstandard curtsey. Howard Elving, the very nice Counselor of Embassy, said, &quot;That wasn't much of a curtsey, Eleanore.&quot; (she laughs) &quot;Well, it's the best I can do,&quot; I said.</p>
<p>I remember a Canadian saying to me, &quot;If you're not going to curtsey, I'm not going to either.&quot; So at the end of the line, I didn't curtsey, and she didn't. I had said to my husband, &quot;I just don't want to curtsey, I don't feel I should,&quot; and Armi would get this plaintive look and say, &quot;Well, of course there's my career.&quot; (both laughing) But we had this understanding if something really important came up, he would not insist in humiliating me. When we were at Brussels and the wife of the DCM and some other wives were really humiliated by the Ambassador's wife -- you know I just felt that these husbands ...</p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): You were there with Mrs. MacArthur?</em></p>
<p>LEE: Yes. And she was a Medea. I think she was a desperately unhappy woman, that's the only way I can figure it.</p>
<p><em>Q (SQUIRE): And she followed a perfectly lovely lady, Mrs. Burden, who was a Vanderbilt, a lady.</em></p>
<p>LEE: They would invite you to some function which you ought to go to anyway and you'd go and she'd thank you, and then she'd walk you out to the car afterwards. I remember Thanksgiving, when they invited [everyone] to a Thankgsviging dinner and the DCM went to her and said, &quot;You know, most of them probably want to be home with their children then, Mrs. Burden.&quot; He was really belling the cat, because he was fond of her. And she said, &quot;Oh, I never thought of that, of course they don't have to come if they don't want to.&quot; She was just so anxious always, so sweet and nice. And then to have this crew come sweeping in. He kept talking about &quot;the taut ship,&quot; he was going to run by God a t-a-u-t ship. And everybody just hated his guts.</p>
<p><em>Q (SQUIRE): So he was that way too and didn't see anything amiss with her behavior.</em></p>
<p>LEE: Evidently not. I don't know what they did in the quiet of their bedroom, I'm sure. I expect they must have had some words, but they were both unpleasant people.</p>
<p><em>Q (SQUIRE): He called everybody &quot;girl,&quot; which nearly drove the head of the Political section, this marvelous lady named Margaret Tibbetts, up the wall to be called &quot;hello girl.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): Oh yes: she was one of the very early women in the Foreign Service.</em></p>
<p>LEE: And she was marvelous, really a wonderful mind. You haven't taped her, have you? (Fenzi says no) I have a nice story about her. She came home and President Johnson appointed her Ambassador to Norway. It was in the wintertime, she came from Maine, her deceased father was a doctor and her widowed mother lived in Maine. She called up one very snowy day when New England was engulfed in storm, and said, &quot;Mother, I've got great news to tell you.&quot; And her mother said, &quot;Margaret Rose, that's lovely but I've got wonderful news to tell you.&quot; Margaret said, &quot;The President has just made me Ambassador to Norway.&quot; And her mother said, (she imitates cozy tone of voice) &quot;Well Margaret that's fine but do you know we've got 42 inches of snow?&quot; Tibbetts was supposedly going to Finland first, but the Finns turned her down because a lot of business is done in the sauna. I think Norway was a more pleasant experience.</p>
<p>I think I'll go back to Jamaica. We had a home assignment. This was where I began to hear more and more about McCarthy. I can remember taking Rebecca, our pre-school child, [to] Phoebe Hearst's school, we lived in DC at 35th Street, and talking with some indignation about what McCarthy was doing. A Foreign Service wife was there and said, &quot;You mustn't say these things out loud.&quot; This horrified me further, becaused it seemed to me it was a time when Americans should say a good many things out loud, and the louder the better it would be. But we began to be aware how dangerous the climate was in the United States.</p>
<p>We had indeed while still in New Zealand begun to be aware, because some very unpleasant things had happened. An authority in New Zealand on some subject, I've forgotten what, had been asked for by an American institution which needed his expertise. The FBI or the CIA or somebody had discovered that this expert's father had belonged to the New Zealand Communist party. The expert himself had never been a Communist, had no sympathy for it though he was friendly with his father -- you know how it is in New Zealand and Australia. This man was debarred from the United States even though it was in our interest for him to come. It was just one of those silly things that went on during this tense time.</p>
<p>Then we ran into a rather heartbreaking situation. Armistead's brother, Duncan Lee, had been with the OSS, later the CIA, and his wife, whom he'd met at Oxford, were accused by Elizabeth Bentley of being secret members of the Communist Party. We opened the New York Times one morning and there was Duncan's picture on the front page. Duncan never took the Fifth Amendment and denied that he was a member a Party member. Knowing Duncan that it was absolutely inconceivable that he was.</p>
<p>Then the State Department bored in on Armistead. &quot;What can you tell us about your brother, what can you say about your brother?&quot; Armistead's reply was, &quot;I have nothing to say about my brother except I know about his loyalty in the Service.&quot; That was put in his record as being rather sinister. Duncan always felt that Armistead suffered in some of these years.</p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): You said that State Department bored in, it must have been because McCarthy was putting pressure on -- who was Secretary of State then?</em></p>
<p>LEE: Dulles came in later. But you see, there was a security group in the Department whose duty it was to root out subversives, and these people were almost mindless. They began to count numbers -- you could find so-many people, it accrued to your benefit and to your record and it pleased some of the more dreadful Senators we had to see these names come out. It was a very sad time. And then there were people who were trying to prove their patriotism in the State Department, and they would write reports and it was whether so-and-so was &quot;possibly subversive.&quot;</p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): You really couldn't trust your colleagues, people who had been friends.</em></p>
<p>LEE: And Armi had been to Oxford too, he was a Rhodes Scholar, and there were questions about -- actually, the Chicago Tribune ran a frontpage story about Rhodes scholars, saying probably their loyalty wasn't to the United States at all anyway, it was probably to England. Which is absurd.Q (FENZI): Do you have a copy of that?</p>
<p>LEE: Probably somewhere. But it was a terrible blow to Armi's parents. His father was an Episcopal minister and his mother was a rather extraordinary woman and they were ... [End of side A, tape l; Begin side B, tape l]...[because of some doubt where preceding side of tape had ended, they repeat anecdote about Tibbetts, and Lee's initial remarks about her brother-in-law and accusation by Bentley]</p>
<p>... actually was in OSS, he flew the Hum[China-Burma-India theater of WWII]. He'd also been a Rhodes Scholar and at Oxford, met and married Ishbel and returned to the States. He was in the plane that went down with Eric Sevareid, did you remember that? They had to bail out; and Duncan had never been in a parachute before -- I'm sure I would have put my arms around the engine and gone down with the plane. They landed and one man was killed. They were in headhunting territory, in jungle. One of then was leading them out and they met a headhunter. He didn't know quite how one addressed a headhunter, all he knew was what he'd read in James Fenimore Cooper. So he raised his right hand and said, &quot;How!&quot;</p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): Where did this plane go down?</em></p>
<p>LEE: I really don't know -- New Guinea? It was sort of Malaysia, and they found a archetypical romantic British officer living with his bathtub and tent and a dressing-for-dinner person who knew all about the area, who finally helped them and they got out. This was very exciting. But anyway, Duncan was accused by Elizabeth Bentley whom they'd met socially in Washington of being a member of the Communist Party and this is what hit the front page of the New York Times. I was told by a newspaperman that actually the FBI it would be -- he was OSS and a member of the CIA, and the FBI was evidently looking into this sort of thing, and they felt even more upset over Ishbel, I suppose thinking she was an alien, and everybody &quot;knew&quot; that British intellectuals were all risky people.</p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): So she couldn't come into this country.</em></p>
<p>LEE: Well, she was here. Something else happened. You can never clear yourself when you've been accused. Duncan didn't take the Fifth, and he testified, and he told how he knew Elizabeth Bentley. Actually the things that she said Duncan had told her he couldn't possibly have told her because they were outside his perimeter somehow. Anyway, he had these black marks against him. And then Armistead was approached by the security section of the State Department asking him about his own career and his own beliefs, and what could he tell about his brother -- to testify against his brother. This really riled Armistead very much, and he responded in a haughty manner. When we finally got Armi's file from the FBI, it's full of black marks.</p>
<p>And there's one charge in it that he went down to Chatham Hall, a girls' school in Virginia where his father had been headmaster, and he'd come back from the Soviet Union and had a hammer and sickle in his buttonhole and gave this marvelously glorified picture of the Soviet Union and how wonderful it was. And that was in his file. Armistead has never been to the Soviet Union in his life, never gave a talk down at Chatham Hall. It's just absolutely made up of whole cloth. But I'm sure this happened to a lot of other people too.</p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): You alluded to the security people beginning to think in numbers. (a cautionary repetition of last part of Side A)</em></p>
<p>LEE: Yes. They wanted to show how efficient they were, so they began lookling into all sorts of things and trying to rack up kills. There were people in the Foreign Service who were not craven, who stood out against this but you can understand how in a place like Germany, for instance, under the Nazis why so many people folded, and why so many people folded in Romania. When you're going to be persecuted or people you love are going to be persecuted, how many of us are courageous? But Duncan's trials were ended there. He was an international lawyer, he could argue before the Privy Council in England. He was transferred to Bermuda where the Star Insurance Company had a big outfilt and he and Ishbel -- they had five children -- were in Bermuda. President Eisenhower was going to go to Bermuda for some sort of conference and the security people and FBI said, &quot;Oh my goodness Duncan Lee is there, a known Communist spy, how dangerous.&quot; And they brought him home and left Ishbel there with five children and he couldn't rejoin her for a whole year. There was nothing he could do about it.</p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): It's hard to believe.</em></p>
<p>LEE: There wasn't anything he could do. They were divorced. We think that after 21 years and five children but this experience was the final push.</p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): And this all reflected against your husband, didn't it.</em></p>
<p>LEE: Well, in a way yes. Duncan was so upset over Armistead and we kept saying, &quot;Look, the feeling around the country, the whole ambiance is so bad, it didn't take you to do anything.&quot; Armi spoke out, I spoke out. Look what was done to Jack Service, it all went on his record. For a certain kind of mind this was a bad thing.</p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): And Edmund Clubb and John Paton Davies -- why were those three perhaps the ones who suffered the most?</em></p>
<p>LEE: They were the ones who &quot;lost China.&quot;</p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): Yes, but there were other people who &quot;lost China&quot; too.</em></p>
<p>LEE: But John Stewart Service and John Paton Davies and Clubb and I think there was someone else... They seemed to have it in for the China hands. You know, we were almost sent to China. Armi was born there. Armi has often said, &quot;Why, I could have lost China.&quot; (both laugh) &quot;I came within an ace of losing China.&quot; (hearty laughter) I can hear him.</p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): On to Jamaica, you said you were exiled to Jamaica.</em></p>
<p>LEE: We went to Harvard for a year, which was very pleasant, and then we went to Reykjavik --Q (FENZI): And you met Adrian Cook at Harvard.</p>
<p>LEE: We asked for a European post and they said they'd love to give us a European post and it turned out to be Iceland. We had to send Norie away to school because there was no way of giving her high school iReykjavik. There was an American school some place in England but I had looked it over andidn't think it was very good, they had dreadful control over the children, just bad. So we sent Norie to Chatham Hall, where else. Then I started the school and taught third and fourth grade, but the shining light in Reykjavik was the DCM and his wife, Theodore, who is now dead, and his wife Louise who, now in her 80s, lives across the river, I see her frequently. He had been a newspaperman, and he was a rock of integrity. Nobody got away with anything with Ted, and he never once buckled under McCarthyism or anything. A wonderful person. He was the one who when he became editor of the Foreign Service Journal, kept asking me to write some things about the Foreign Service. That's how I wrote &quot;The Five.&quot; He kept saying, &quot;Why don't you write them? You've got things to say about the dreadful system the Foreign Service. Why don't you do it? I won't let anybody know it's you.&quot;</p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): But you did do them under a nom de plume.</em></p>
<p>LEE: Yes, I had to, because Armistead was still in the Service and poor Armi couldn't take anything more. He already had a file that reached to the skies, I suppose, and I knew that Ted would never reveal who I was, if they tortured him he wouldn't reveal it. He really was a wonderful man.</p>
<p>We had a good time in Reykjavik. I had thought it was sort of a dreary assignment, but you know when you go some places, begin to meet the people, understand the history ...</p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): But you don't go with any expectations, my husband always sai(she laughs) ...</em></p>
<p>LEE: You do better!</p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): Yes! You talked about having parties and people staying all night.</em></p>
<p>LEE: And there was an enormous amount of drinking. Now, the Icelanders drink in spurts. If the liquor is there, they'll drink it all up. If it's not there, they don't mind. And I gather this is apt to be true of the Finns and the Danes and the Swedes. So you got so you didn't bring out the bottl(laughing heartily) when people came. But I had enormous admiration for them, living on that windswept, treeless island. I remember going to see their national forest and the trees were this high and a sign said &quot;Please do not step on the trees.&quot; They were trying to reforest, and it's evidently very difficult once you've removed all the trees.</p>
<p>While we were there several ships went down. In the North Sea the rigging gets covered with ice and then the whole thing careens over. There was one very interesting man named Benjamin Franklin -- now his last name escapes me -- Stefansson or something like that. He was an economist, and the first time we had him for dinner I asked him, &quot;How did you happen to be named Benjamin Franklin Whatever-it-was?&quot; And he said, &quot;My brother was named Benjamin Franklin. He was on a fishing ship -- of course in those days everybody made their living fishing -- and the ship went down and all hands were lost. My mother was pregnant with me. Benjamin came to her in a dream and said he was coming back, and when I was born she knew that it was Benjamin. So I became Benjamin Franklin.&quot; Evidently there is a very strong strain, sort of like table-rappings. And if you're ever out in this lunar landscape in Iceland when the wind is moaning across the rocky fields, you can see the ghosts.</p>
<p>We saw quite a few interesting paintings when we were there. They were abstract paintings, and I've never liked abstract paintings until I lived in Iceland. It's an &quot;abstract&quot; landscape and I could see what they meant.</p>
<p>They're very literate, they had more bookshops per capita than any other country in the world. They all spoke English -- fortunately, because Iceland is a highly inflected language. Armistead studied it so he could read the economic news in the newspaper but I gather that it's just a terrible [language] -- nothing like ignorance: in college I had had Anglo-Saxon and Old English and I thought, Oh, it'll be absolutely nothing to me when I go to Iceland. Well, of course the Icelandic language is preserved in amber, it went way, way back long before Anglo-Saxon or anything I'd ever studied. Our children, to our amazement, picked it up. Jeffrey came home one day and said, &quot;You know, there's a British ship out in the harbor and it's fired on an Icelandic boat.&quot; I said, &quot;Oh Jeffy, that can't possibly be true.&quot; He said, &quot;Yes, it's true.&quot; I said, &quot;How do you know?&quot; He said, &quot;Well, this Icelandic boy told me.&quot; I said, &quot;Jeffrey, you don't speak Icelandic.&quot; And he said, &quot;No, I don't.&quot; (she laughs) But he did. That's when we learned he had begun to pick it up. Isn't it amazing how children have a special center in their brain that seems to make it possible, that locks it in.</p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): Well, they have fewer inhibitions than we do. And they have fewer words to learn.</em></p>
<p>LEE: That's right, it's a play vocabulary, and it is easier. But then of course it goes very quickly. When we went to Brussels it was gone before you could say &quot;Jack Robinson.&quot;</p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): Once they started to school and began to read, then I think the-- at least my children kept French.</em></p>
<p>LEE: Yes but you see, you don't read Icelandic. When we were there, only about 180,000 people in the whole world spoke the language. It's a lovely language to listen to. If you walk into a room hearing Icelanders talk, there's a -- you think it's English. Was it Archibald MacLeish spoke about &quot;the iron of English rings from the tongue.&quot; You get that same feeling when you hear the Icelanders talk. And it is our great-great-grandfather language. They were marvelous, rugged, strong and very democratic people. I did admire them.</p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): You've given us a wonderful backdrop against which you played out your Service years; we know exactly where you were. But what were you doing in this time? Were you teaching school and taking care of children and giving teaparties? How did you spend your time?</em></p>
<p>LEE: Well, going back to Australia and New Zealand: we were living in a neighborhood in Australia. First, in Africa, I taught some businessmen, as I put down on the bio-data form. They wanted practice in English conversation. And I gave dinner parties. There was a terrible protocol question in Dakar because practically all of the young women we knew were &quot;living&quot; as they quaintly put it &quot;in sin&quot;. I was asked by a ver(she breaks up momentarily) stiff lady at the American Consulate why I entertained young women who were openly living in sin. She herself was living in sin, but discreetly, and she thought that a distinction should be made between those who were doing it -- of course, everybody knew Dakar was like something out of &quot;The Alexandria Quartet.&quot; [Durrell tetralogy] Everybody knew what everybody else was doing.</p>
<p>So I said, &quot;Well, I'll think about it.&quot; I was the only Foreign Service wife on the coast of Africa. (both laugh heartily) So I thought about it deeply, and then I handed down my decision. I said, &quot;I don't feel I should make any distinctions.&quot; So we invited all. I felt for the young secretaries -- more of them began to arrive as we got farther away from the War. And our lovely Consul General said, &quot;I don't want anybody going down to the dock to meet these wretched women, they've got to learn what it's like here.&quot; So Armi always sneaked off with somebody else and met them, the poor souls that came in. And then I got so I invited them to my house, and then I explained about sex in Daka(laughing gain) and about how very easy it was to shack up with a nice young man, and how a lot of them were married, and a lot of it was heartbreak, and I hoped very much they would think carefully about what they did and their future there. I must say I didn't have a great deal of authorit(both laughing) but I felt I'd made an effort.</p>
<p>It was a rotten kind of decadent city. It was full of soldiers, full of gossip; it was an extraordinary experience. I remember going to the beach with Norie one time and a woman coming over and saying, &quot;Oh! I heard you'd gone to South Africa with Major Somebody-or-Other.&quot; I said, (she assumes a sprightly tone) &quot;Oh! That's interesting. I hadn't been able to find anybody to leave the baby with, whom would you suggest?&quot; You know, it was just full of rumors. And then there was one poor woman, wife of a French official, who came and begged to be invited to the parties at the Consulate. This little kind of rat-trap consulate with people barely able to get along with each other, and she felt this was the epitome of society and begged to come. It was sort of horrifying.</p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): But it was nice that we had tha[phrase obscured by cough].</em></p>
<p>LEE: Well, let's see, what did I do in Australia ... In Australia we were part of a neighborhood and there were just constant meetings. We lived in the Australian community and sort of merged to do official functions. I did have a miscarriage there, and started to have a second baby. It was very informal. I did give quite a few talks. People would ask me to talk before schools. (tape turned off during coughing spell, then resumes)</p>
<p>But there was so much emphasis on food, and on clothes, and on social position. I remember an incident in Brussels when Judy, very pregnant, came to the DCM's coffee, I brought her, and she told me she was feeling a little bit wispy and would go out and sit in the car. I was approached by the wife of the Agricultural Attaché, who said, &quot;I want to get to the trolley, would you take me there?&quot; I said I'd be delighted. So we walked out together. Arrived at my car, there was little Judy sitting in the front seat, and this woman stood there. I went around to the driver's seat, she was still standing there. It didn't dawn on me what the matter was, and finally she said, &quot;Well, I suppose don't worry about the order of your going.&quot; And it dawned on me: she thought she shoud be in the front seat. So I said, &quot;No, just get in the back seat and go.&quot; And I took her down.</p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): There were people who did that. Like going to the ladies' room. I remember being sent in ahead because I was pregnant, otherwise you went in according to the rank of your husband.</em></p>
<p>LEE: I do have one funny passage in belling the cat where I tell about Wahwee at a party sitting down in the center of the sofa that will hold five and the ladies peeling off according to their rank.</p>
<p>In Australia I enjoyed myself very much. I did give some talks. Once somebody asked me one time to give a talk on &quot;America the Melting Pot,&quot; so I graciously consented. Armistead reported it to the Consul General, who said, &quot;I don't think that's a very good subject, she might get into difficulties with that. I don't want her to talk on America.&quot; So I had to tell these people that I couldn't talk on America the melting pot. &quot;Well,&quot; they said, &quot;what could you talk on?&quot; And I said, &quot;How about Robert Frost?&quot; So I talked about Robert Frost the New England poet.</p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): I know that in Brussels you graded the exams of the English-speaking children at the Common Market school?</em></p>
<p>LEE: No. I tutored American kids who were going to take the SATs. There was one fellow, living as nephew with his aunt and uncle, who was going to take the SATs and had hardly ever written a composition in his life. So he came to me, and I said, &quot;Let's pretend that this is the subject: How has the hero in literature changed? Try not to think in more than three paragraphs, and do this and this and this.... &quot; This is the subject he got on his exam: &quot;The Hero in English Literature.&quot; (she breaks up) And I got a book, he gave me Bartlett's Quotations with a little inscription on it. He got into the college on my psyching.</p>
<p>What else? I served on the school board with Hope, and we were really rather embattled on that school board, we spent a lot of time on it. Then I belonged to the Canadian Women's Club, where you had to produce a scholarly paper. So I produced a scholarly paper. There was a lot of entertaining. And I can remember it was pretty tense because so often somebody didn't come in on time on a plane. And I remember the first dinner party I gave. Of course Angela was there, and I had a caterer. One of the Belgian guests came in, and when he sat down at table he tucked his napkin right into his cravat, and you realized he lived for his food. So I just watched breathlessly. When the grand marnier soufflé came in, he burst into applause, (she claps her hands) he congratulated the cook and Angela, and they tipped everybody. Which seemed to me a very strange thing to do; and I realized that food meant a very great deal to Belgians. I was very careful. I didn't have a caterer after that, I did it myself, but Angela was a great help, she really was an angel.</p>
<p><em>Q (SQUIRE): And remember when you used to come with your washing when your machine broke down?</em></p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): And lowered the tone of your building.</em></p>
<p>LEE: We had a very nice couple named Julé, [phonetic] who lived just above us. Our conversation was confined to &quot;Bonjours! Bon soir!&quot; One day, after we'd been told we were leaving, Mme. Julé said to us, &quot;Mme. Lee, I understand you're leaving us.&quot; And I said, &quot;Yes, alas, we are.&quot; And she said, &quot;Oh, what a shame, you are so simpathèque!&quot; That was warmth from a Belgian.</p>
<p>Then we were asked by the Pouterman[phonetic], who went to Brittany for a holiday, I think they had a little house there. And we, to our surprise, got a postcard from them asking why didn't we come and they could put up some of the children and there was a nearby hotel. Armi showed this at the Embassy, and everybody said &quot;GO!&quot; So the Poutermans took Rebecca and Norie, and we had Jeffrey in the hotel, and we had a lovely time. The Poutermans were warm, and when we left Mme. Pouterman said, &quot;Your girls, zay could stay wiz me forever.&quot; [they could stay with me forever]</p>
<p><em>Q (SQUIRE): They were Flemish, which made a difference.</em></p>
<p>LEE: Yes, it did. He did translations into Flemish of Robert Frost's poetry. He said it translated very easily into Flemish. I never saw his translations, it wouldn't have meant anything to me if I had.</p>
<p>That's pretty much what I did. I had to be home with the children quite a lot. And it rained a great deal. We had a Monopoly game going in the living room ...</p>
<p><em>Q (SQUIRE): With my child, whenever it was raining.</em></p>
<p>LEE: It was back and forth. We were very sedulous about that. So I think we were pretty well occupied.</p>
<p><em>Q (SQUIRE): French lessons.</em></p>
<p>LEE: Oh yes, I went to the Embassy every morning and got oiled up in French. In New Zealand, I did give some lectures for the Workers Educational Association, which was wonderful, a very active outfit. They asked me if I'd be willing to give lectures on American poets. So I gave it twice. I think there was a series of six lectures that I wrote and gave. Then I was asked by some little town outside Wellington to repeat it and gave it a second time. Then the radio station called and asked me -- Edgar Allan Poe's birthday was coming up, and would I talk a little bit about Poe, and would I read 'Bells'?&quot; I said I'd be delighted to talk about Poe but I really couldn't read &quot;Bells.&quot; I couldn't see myself saying &quot;Bells, bells, bells...&quot; So I asked them if &quot;The Raven&quot; wouldn't do just as well? They decided it would.</p>
<p>Then I did an Emily Dickinson lecture. She has always been a special friend of mine, and the Emily Dickinson one was the most successful. I was told after I left that they rebroadcast it several times.</p>
<p><em>Q (SQUIRE): You are such a perfect example of someone who could have had a successful career in the Foreign Service, you could have carried your career with you.</em></p>
<p>LEE: I don't know. Because in most of these countries they have rules about employing aliens.</p>
<p><em>Q (SQUIRE): Not now. We have that ...</em></p>
<p>LEE: I know it's reciprocal but how does it work? I understand it doesn't work too well.</p>
<p><em>Q (SQUIRE): But we have international schools, and now we teach people to teach English as a second language. But you already were doing this, way back.</em></p>
<p>LEE: Well, I think the situation is entirely different for wives now. From what I've heard, some complaints about wives in the Foreign Service as it is today, some of them don't enter into the life as much as they should. I hope this isn't true because I think you get a lot out of it if you -- I did resent going to these fiendish coffees at Wahwee MacArthur's that you had to go. It was silly. And when she said, you remember, &quot;Where is little Mrs. So-and-So?&quot; And the DCM's wife said, &quot;Well, she has a baby and the baby's ill,&quot; and she said, (mimicking haughty voice) &quot;I don't consider that an adequate excuse.&quot; You know, the utter impertinence and rudeness of these people is [unbelievable].</p>
<p><em>Q (SQUIRE): And you knew you had to go, so you had to have sitters lined up so you could go no matter what.</em></p>
<p>LEE: So I'm glad that system has changed.</p>
<p><em>Q (SQUIRE): But you would have been an English teacher, I mean you are an English teacher and were one but you'd have been able to carry it around, I think.</em></p>
<p>LEE: Possibly so. I enjoyed the tutoring. And of course with children -- I suppose you could carry, everybody carries on a career with children now. And we had help in the home. But I did enough so that I can't say my life in the Foreign Service was one of frustration. In spite of some of the horrible Officers we had, I enjoyed it, I made so many good friends, I enjoyed the countries where we lived.</p>
<p><em>Q (SQUIRE): You've just said something then. You suppose you could have carried on a career with children. We never thought about it.</em></p>
<p>LEE: We never thought of it, we were brought up that way.</p>
<p><em>Q (SQUIRE): It was something that might happen later.</em></p>
<p>LEE: But now, they have to do it. And they want to do it, I think many of them want to do it. I have a feeling that there are some who do not, and I hope that they won't have to if they don't want to. I found, suddenly with my first child, I don't know whether it happened to every American woman, but suddenly I had two university degrees and I was spending my tim(she laughs heartily) in conversation with a two-year-old. You know, you do require a little lift during these periods.</p>
<p><em>Q (SQUIRE): At least we had that -- our husbands were in a profession where people were interesting, the conversation that went around us in the evening was interesting.</em></p>
<p>LEE: And you felt the work they were dong was worthwhile. And a lot of time the things you were doing were worthwhile, it wasn't just putting canapés on a plate.</p>
<p><em>Q (SQUIRE): Well, Brussels was growing so, the American community was growing when we were there, also. So we were busy all the time.</em></p>
<p>LEE: And fortunately we weren't always exposed to the MacArthurs. I can remember when my mother came out, she was so horrified. She felt just the way I did when I first entered the Foreign Service. &quot;This isn't American! I'm going to tell George.&quot; &quot;George&quot; was George Aiken who was in the Senate. She told George but he couldn't do anything about it. (she laughs heartily) It is inexcusable that a Foreign Service chief should behave so badly to his underlings. There's no excuse for it.</p>
<p><em>Q (SQUIRE): And the wives may have been worse.</em></p>
<p>LEE: Oh I think some of them were absolute fiends. (she laughs)</p>
<p><em>Q (SQUIRE): Do you suppose they still are?</em></p>
<p>LEE: Well, I don't believe they can be.</p>
<p><em>Q (SQUIRE): They can't force people to do things.</em></p>
<p>LEE: I think that's been erased, don't you suppose? Now, I suppose there's still a great deal of tension about the promotion list, and women are insisting that they haven't been treated right, and the blacks, I suppose, are saying they're not represented enough; and there are all kinds of tensions and disputes. But the wives must be completely apart from this now, I can't see how it would impinge on them in any way. They can have their own careers and they can earn their own money and they don't have to show up at functions.</p>
<p><em>Q (SQUIRE): They can entertain if they want to.</em></p>
<p>LEE: Or not. So, in a way I would think this was progress, wouldn't you?</p>
<p><em>Q (SQUIRE): Oh yes. I think that they're missing some of the things that we had.</em></p>
<p>LEE: I do too. Particularly if they don't understand that there's a certain amount of pleasure to be gained from [the experience][End of side B, tape I; Begin side A, tape II]</p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): Dorothy Stansbury, who was then head of OBC, got together 27 women to put out guidelines. Now, mind you, this was 1971, Dorothy Stansbury was a feminist-activist, the president of the Women's Action Organization. They made her the head of Wives Training, which she named Spouse Training because we began getting male spouses in. She convened these 27 women to do these guidelines which were out of the Middle Ages for the times. I knew Carol Pardon'[phonetic] article was in there because I had copied it, but I didn't realize yours was there. So you were here in Washington at the time?</em></p>
<p>LEE: I was here in Washington and Armistead had just retired from the Foreign Service. So I came out from under my shield and I was very polite about the guidelines. I said I approached guidelines for Foreign Service wives at posts abroad with &quot;lively interest&quot;. It is a commendable attempt at improvement in an area which needs improvement. Unlike its many predecessors, pronouncements handed down from Sinai raising hackles all the way from Delhi to Dakar, this one takes a pleasant, intelligent and encouraging tone. It's conciliatory, it is reasonable, it is hortatory, and I am afraid it often will not work.&quot;</p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): And it didn't.</em></p>
<p>LEE: It didn't, no. And then I proceed to tell why I think it won't work.</p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): And it didn't. And I don't know any of those people. I do recognize a couple of names. I recognize George Lambrakis, and Gerald Lamberty, and Irving Cheslaw, those are the only names I recognize. Do you know any of those people?</em></p>
<p>LEE: I'd been away for a long time at that time.</p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): But you see, in part of the talk I give at FSI I say that those guidelines just absolutely blew the roof as far as the young wives are concerned. And that's exactly what happened. And you having been through it for how many years?</em></p>
<p>LEE: For practically 25 years.</p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): And just out of the Service, could see that they weren't going to work, too.</em></p>
<p>LEE: At the end of my article I suggest an ombudsman. I realized that the picture the Foreign Service has of itself would preclude a labor union. (she laughs) But I would suggest an ombudsman, somebody who would be outside to whom one could refer injustices and problems that come up.</p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): In a way, FLO has done that. Not entirely but FLO has become the ombudsman for families and spouses.</em></p>
<p>LEE: But Pat was talking about the wife of the Ambassador in USSR, saying that she really frightens Foreign Service wives today.</p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): She seems like a rather formidable person.</em></p>
<p>LEE: She is. But I should think that just because the thing has changed, it must be better than it was under Wahwee.</p>
<p><em>Q (SQUIRE): Wahwee could make you come and do the flowers.</em></p>
<p>LEE: She almost sent -- who was the girl who worked in the Economic section with Armi in Brussels? Mary Carmichael ... I had, fortunately, arthritis when I was there with Wahwee and I used it to the hilt. And Mary came up to me one day savagely. &quot;I know what you're doing. You're going to the parties you want to go to and staying home when you don't want to go.&quot; And I said, &quot;Mary, mind your own business.&quot; (all laugh)</p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): We won't name names but in what capacity does the woman in Moscow operate? She has no control, so what does she do? Maybe she should be told what she's doing.</em></p>
<p>LEE: I suppose she can say to her husband, &quot;That family is murder and don't you promote Foreign Service X.&quot;</p>
<p><em>Q (SQUIRE): Oh no, I don't think she'd do that.</em></p>
<p>LEE: I don't know.</p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): But how is she frightening them?</em></p>
<p>LEE: I don't see how she could frighten them.</p>
<p><em>Q (SQUIRE): Well, I don't know whether she frightens them but she gets ...</em></p>
<p>LEE: She just ...</p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): Well, it must be hard when you've paid your dues and be somewhat in your own mind living by the old rules and yet not being able to put them into ...</em></p>
<p><em>Q (SQUIRE): Oh, I think there were a lot of people who suddenly felt &quot;wow, I've made it, my husband is now a senior Officer and I can't do anything, it's all been taken away from me.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): Part of it could be, also, that women didn't relaize -- could it have been that they didn't realize what their responsibilities were going to be as a senior Officer's wife?</em></p>
<p>LEE: I do think that sometimes the senior Officer's wife felt burdened and tense and probably became more savage than she otherwise -- and I felt about Wahwee MacArthur, as I studied her, she had I think great native intelligence, and I think if she had gone into some career on her own ... And of course being married to him was hard times. He was a dreadful little man.</p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): She may have been subject to pressures from him, which she was then passing on to others? She probably didn't like what she was doing.</em></p>
<p>LEE: She got to be an alcoholic.</p>
<p><em>Q (SQUIRE): Drank only champagne. She was interesting when the Interplanetary Union came to Brussels. Speaking really as the daughter of the Vice President, she lectured us and was very good at that, and said, &quot;Don't you spend any money for them, they just will forget all about it.&quot; And I remember buying a dozen handkerchiefs for Senator Alcott from Colorado, at the very end thinking, &quot;Oh well, I can afford a dozen handkerchiefs.&quot; He not only paid me back, he sent me a lovely little handkerchief that he'd bought in his hotel, along with his card. She was good.</em></p>
<p>LEE: I think she just wasn't using her abilities. When I saw her on the Lorenzo Mark crossing to Portugal, she was a siren. She wore black, and all I can remember is black cut low. I remember writing to Armi, &quot;Retired spy she looks like.&quot; But she was very personable, none of this law-and-orders business. I had nice conversations with Wahwee and she was okay. But somehow getting to be a senior Officer's wife was more than she could handle.</p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): Both you and Caroline speak so fondly of Lisa Greene, and yet other people don't speak fondly of her.</em></p>
<p>LEE: She was hell on wheels in the Foreign Service but she helped nurse me when I was in the hospital and I almost fell over when Lisa walked in, an angel of mercy. Just absolutely charming and sweet. The Foreign Service wasn't good for Lisa.</p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): Caroline is the one person that I've heard say something nice about Mrs. Loy Henderson. She just wasn't interested in what her husband was doing, she didn't like her role, and she probably was a woman before her time. She'd just leave and go up to Kashmir or somewhere, anyway she'd leave New Delhi, she didn't like it, it was hot. She may have been a woman way before her time.</em></p>
<p><em>Q (SQUIRE): So what good were we? Look what he did without ...</em></p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): Well, I've always maintained that what we do has absolutely no bearing on our husband's career at all. (she laughs)</em></p>
<p>LEE: I think so too. I think you had to be a perfectly ghastly wife doing unmentionable things to have made the slightest ...</p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): I don't think even that made any difference! (laughter)</em></p>
<p><em>Q (SQUIRE): We worked hard ...LEE: We worked hard, we entertained Inspectors. I remember when we were in New Zealand an Inspector broke his leg on the airplane. Something happened and he was bounced, so he came to dinner in a cast. We were all very tender with him and took care of him.</em></p>
<p><em>Q (SQUIRE): Oh, those days of planning for every single minute.</em></p>
<p>LEE: And you had children, and in New Zealand you didn't have any help half the time. We didn't have central heating there, it gets so cold; it didn't snow but it sleeted. We had a fireplace and I was just feeding the fireplace all day.</p>
<p>But you know, to go back to the Ambassador's wife in New Zealand, this sort of exotic flower who came and began to adjust to New Zealand and enjoy it. After we left, one of the wives lost a baby, and this woman just came in day after day and held her hand, just darling to her. And you wouldn't have dreamed it was possible when she arrived.</p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): I think a lot of these women are just out of their elements, they just don't know how to act. I really believe that.</em></p>
<p><em>Q (SQUIRE): Which is interesting when they've gone up through the Service. I mean, some of the real ogres by reputation are women who went right up from being a Vice Consuls' wife.</em></p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): Well, &quot;power corrupts.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>Q (SQUIRE): &quot;And absolute power corrupts absolutely.&quot; (all laugh)</em></p>
<p>LEE: It was wonderful to see somebody who was at the to of the heap who was pleasant and relaxed and charming and sweet and untense.</p>
<p><em>Q (SQUIRE): Oh, I can remember that awful time at the end of [our Brussels] tour when somebody came in the airport and Ambassador MacArthur had a speech which was written for him and he stood up and delivered it. Then some American General gave a speech, and it was two minutes longer than our Ambassador's. And he had a temper tantrum. &quot;By God, I'm of the deck here&quot; -- back at the ranch -- &quot;nobody, but nobody is to speak longer than I do.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): And so, she picked up on that.</em></p>
<p>LEE: She was Alben Barkley's daughter and he was so witty and charming and laid back. I gather that her sister was a very nice girl, and I asked somebody who knew those girls when they were little if Wahwee was [bossy] and they couldn't see that she was. I think shmust have been the small sister because in the family Wahwee was a baby name for her. I don't know her real name.</p>
<p><em>Q (SQUIRE): Maybe her sister called her that.</em></p>
<p>LEE: Well, are we through?Q (FENZI): Yes, we are, for now.</p>

<p>IBM's victory at Jeopardy has led to the usual woe-is-humans handwringing, including (charmingly) <a class="reference external" href="http://www.slate.com/id/2284721/pagenum/all/">from Jennings himself</a>.</p>
<p>But look, while I agree that the logic of machines crowding out off-the-shelf humans is compelling, I think there's some reason for hope. &nbsp;I, and probably most of you, already carry a substantial <a class="reference external" href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/">neural prosthesis</a> around with me all the time, which confers superhuman trivia capabilities at a level even more impressive than the Watson system. &nbsp;It's just that a couple of the system buses are a bit slow. &nbsp;The neural bus will remain relatively sluggish, but for now it's the interface that's the real problem.</p>
<p>I think there's a lot of low-hanging fruit that can be grabbed on this front: voluntary cochlear implants, haptic interfaces, mobile or ubiquitous ambient displays -- but at some point we'll be talking about neural interfaces, and the problem's going to require technology that's currently only speculative. &nbsp;That's going to be a difficult problem to solve. &nbsp;More difficult than creating artificially intelligent beings? &nbsp;Honestly, I don't think we know enough to guess. &nbsp;But I suspect the answer could go a long way toward determining whether or not our descendants spend their days fighting Terminators.</p>
<p><strong>Let me add:</strong> it occurs to me that one interesting/tragic side-effect of the steadily improving quality of these interfaces is likely to be the disenfranchisement of older workers who are biologically incapable of utilizing these self-enhancing tools. &nbsp;I don't just mean in an &quot;old people can't work the VCR&quot; way (though I think that may be related); I mean that neuroplasticity declines with age, and it's conceivable that some of these technologies will simply be impossible to install in people with less malleable nervous systems. &nbsp;My understanding is that there's already some reason to think this phenomenon affects users of cochlear implants (though I'd want to do a bit more reading about it to be sure).</p>

                    <p>Over at Grist Tom Philpott has written a few posts about the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.grist.org/article/2011-02-10-still-drinking-diet-soda-dont-be-a-fashion-victim-pepsi-strokes">dangers</a> of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.grist.org/article/2011-02-14-just-how-bad-is-aspartame-the-leading-u.s.-fake-sweetener">diet</a> <a class="reference external" href="http://www.grist.org/article/2011-02-16-aspartame-soda-caramel-BPA-diet-soda-kill-you">soda</a>, and I've been acting cranky about them on Twitter. To be honest, it's not that the posts are that bad, or even that I disagree with their gist. I tend to think that soda isn't very good for me in general, and I avoid artificial sweeteners because (in order of decreasing importance to me) I don't like the taste, have mostly weaned myself off sweeteners, and put at least some stock in the health case against them. So I haven't really got a dog in this fight, other than general reactionary impulses. I am also not anxious to get into a big huge debate with Tom, because frankly he knows much more about food science than I do. Besides, he seems like a nice guy.</p>
<p>Still, these posts got my goat. I think it's because they're emblematic of a number of rhetorical tics that people use when trying to write scary stories about chemicals. And I hate that shit. The audience for that kind of thing is useless at picking or prioritizing their battles; I tend to think it leads to more anxiety, fewer vaccinated kids, and absolutely no effect on policy or health outcomes (other than those related to communicable disease, of course).</p>
<p>Also, I'm confident that Tom's a smart guy, so the posts struck me as deliberately engineered linkbait, which I also dislike.</p>
<p>Anyway, the Twitter can of worms has been opened, so let me explain here what bugged me about these posts and made me feel that they were representative of bad online coverage of environmental toxins in general.</p>
<p><strong>Cherry-picking research</strong></p>
<p>This one's easy. Confirmation bias is real (look around and you'll see it everywhere, the joke goes). I particularly winced when I read the phrase &quot;Italian researchers&quot;. Admittedly, I don't know the state of Italian biomedical research. But I do follow some alternative energy stuff, and I can tell you with confidence that that country produces more cold fusion &quot;breakthroughs&quot; per capita than anywhere else on earth. Plus, <a class="reference external" href="http://crookedtimber.org/2010/03/23/why-does-italian-academia-suck/">people smarter than me seem to think the Italian academy is a joke</a>. But hey, if the abstract says what we want it to say...</p>
<p>Succumbing to this temptation is understandable, and I've certainly been guilty of it myself. &nbsp;You need to be shut up in a doctoral program for a very long time to begin to possess any kind of immunity. &nbsp;Frankly, I doubt that any of us are equipped to truly resist it. &nbsp;But it's still irritating to be on the other side of it.</p>
<p><strong>Nomenclature as indictment</strong></p>
<p>Particularly infuriating. Lots of chemicals sound scary, and health writers never resist the opportunity to deploy a 5,4-methylpropylbenzepene or whatever into a laboriously recited ingredient list. But it's meaningless. The nomenclature got a lot scarier when chemists changed how they name compounds. There were good reasons for doing this (reasons that open data evangelists would find particularly appealing!), but the change does seem to have some unfortunately profound side effects on the human mind.</p>
<p>Similarly, pointing to constituent elements or the chemical class to which a compound belongs is rarely illuminating. At one point in the third post Tom discusses how caramel coloring is made by denaturing starches with heat and &quot;ammonia-based&quot; compounds. A shout-out to something you keep under your sink next to the drain cleaner can't help but cause alarm. But of course fertilizer is also &quot;ammonia-based&quot;; and nobody seems to worry much when it gets turned into protein and eaten. &nbsp;If you are <a class="reference external" href="http://pipeline.corante.com">Derek Lowe</a> or someone like him, you can start to develop rules of thumb about the biological effects of compounds based on their structure. &nbsp;If you aren't, you can't and shouldn't.</p>
<p>Tom would probably object to this characterization, as his account goes on to discuss a byproduct of the denaturing process that's carcinogenic. I'd say that that falls under &quot;cherry-picking research&quot;. In truth, lots of cooking processes produce carcinogenic compounds (the process he describes is not dissimilar to how pretzels are made). Remember the scare over acrylamides in french fries and other oil-cooked carbohydrates from a few years back (or the one over the char on your steak)? Suddenly it became apparent that we were all consuming boatloads of cancer-causing chemicals! &nbsp;But it turned out that the situation's more complex than that, and a study suggesting that one component of a food has shown carcinogenic effects (often only in an animal model) isn't nearly enough evidence to justify a freakout over the food in general.</p>
<p>As another example, consider coffee, a beverage that Tom points to approvingly at the end of the second post. The roasting process produces a huge array of chemicals, not nearly all of which have been characterized and studied, and many of which have demonstrated carcinogenic effects (<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee">here's a Wikipedia link</a>, though like me you've probably already heard this elsewhere). But that doesn't matter, because coffee is categorized under our semi-arbitrary &quot;good/natural&quot; heuristic, albeit perhaps with various qualifying words attached to it in our laughable mental medical tag cloud (parkinsons/osteoporosis/miscarriage/anemia/whatever).</p>
<p><strong>Ignoring scale</strong></p>
<p>Less relevant to this series of posts, admittedly, but a habitual mistake of this kind of writing. Humans are awful at understanding differences of even several orders of magnitude, and authors are even worse at bothering to convey them. &nbsp;For our purposes, this is a problem on two fronts: both chemical concentrations and the scale of measured health effects. All you have to do is say &quot;there's uranium in your drinking water!&quot; and people will start going nuts. You know what? There almost certainly <em>is</em> uranium in my drinking water, and yours too. There's nasty stuff everywhere; you can't avoid it. Things diffuse! Hell, cosmic rays transmute atoms! But until you quantify the scale and demonstrate the effect, these facts are meaningless. Bad things will get into your body, but usually in very small amounts, and your liver and kidneys will probably have no problem doing their usual kickass job of dealing with them (if the bad thing bioaccumulates, you should admittedly be less sanguine about this; but that's not applicable to the compounds under discussion).</p>
<p>But this is not how the human mind works. You only have to invoke a substance and a sort of animistic power takes over. It's homeopathy at an angle. It's why we have airport security theater. Numbers mean so very little to our idiot monkey brains.</p>
<p><strong>Pretending epidemiology hasn't been invented</strong></p>
<p>Perhaps I will be accused of a kind of libertarian placidity for this one. That would probably be fair. Still, I think that writers often lead with &quot;we are all unwitting participants in a huge and unethical natural experiment!&quot; and then decline to ask whether any data's come in from this bit of mad science. And the fact is that it has. &quot;It's a mixed bag&quot; is the answer that then invariably follows, but that's sort of telling in itself, right? People have been consuming aspartame for a while now -- some of them even doing so while participating in vast longitudinal studies -- and it's just not the case that it makes you start sprouting tumors or hemorrhaging spinal fluid or growing hermaphroditic genitalia. I'm all for getting BPA out of the lining of tins of baby food, but it's pretty hard to make the case that any of the worrying maybes in Tom's posts are actually manifesting themselves as health crises. Yes, someone needs to be manning the watchtower; yes, industry has incentives for bad behavior. But in this particular case I think the decades' worth of rhetorical and scientific stalemate over sweeteners is enough to merit some shrugging and eye-rolling.</p>
<p>Diet sodas are not a serious health problem. They're just not. It may be that avoiding them is a good idea at the margin -- and like I said, I do exactly that, because hell, I don't enjoy 'em anyway. But it's hard for me to take myself very seriously as I do so. Sure, I don't like the idea of methanol in my body, but I dislike it in almost exactly the same way that Scientologists don't like the idea of thetans in theirs. It's just a neurotic tic; an echo of a sort of Jungian archetype about impurity; really, a hobby at best. I mean, I still drink alcohol, and exercise less than I should, and go out in the sun a lot when I'm on vacation. Despite this disregard for my health I am still probably among the healthiest people in history, thanks to having enough money and living in America in the era that I do.</p>
<p>But look, perhaps you are healthier still. That is definitely possible! If so, by all means, freak out about aspartame if you want. It just strikes me as unlikely to deliver a very good return on the worry you intend to invest in it.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>Like <a class="reference external" href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/ezra-klein/2011/02/that_is_what_it_does.html">Ezra</a>, I find <a class="reference external" href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2011/01/dropbox-on-quora.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+BradDelongsSemi-dailyJournal+(Brad+DeLong's+Semi-Daily+Journal)">this explanation</a> for Dropbox's success intellectually attractive. &nbsp;Minimalism! &nbsp;Of course! &nbsp;It's so simple! &nbsp;It's exactly the kind of thing that software developers get off on. For one thing, it legitimizes our lust for Apple products -- despite the fact that Apple UI betrays the idea more often than we admit -- because most of us can't or don't want to distinguish between <em>good aesthetics</em> and <em>simplicity</em>. &nbsp;It's sort of zen. &nbsp;It makes us feel wise. &nbsp;But in this case I don't buy it.</p>
<p>Here's what I think happened. &nbsp;Amazon launched its <a class="reference external" href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/">S3 service</a>. &nbsp;Suddenly you could buy Big Storage services at essentially marginal cost, immediately. &nbsp;No physical capital expenses, and human capital expenses were dramatically reduced (now you need a programmer who can work with AWS, but not someone who can source, install and manage huge RAID arrays in a datacenter somewhere).</p>
<p>That happened, and then a bunch of people tried to resell this service with some paper-thin rebranding/UI work. &nbsp;Kevin Rose and Leah Culver with Pownce, and some Flickr clone with too many O's in its name, and whatever, a bunch of people. &nbsp;Dropbox was the first -- as far as I know -- to come up with a funded business model that could provide a useful amount of synced storage for free.</p>
<p>Also -- and this is something that the Quora answer completely underplays -- &nbsp;Dropbox is quite technically sophisticated. &nbsp;It's not just rsync on a minute cron, you know. &nbsp;It's hooking into filesystem interrupts to notice when stuff changes in the synced folder, and doing it natively on every major OS. &nbsp;It's got quiet but powerful ways of dealing with versioning conflicts. &nbsp;It's also doing all of this with a high degree of polish (I mean: Growl notifications, c'mon). &nbsp;Plus it's smart enough to do things like notice when it needs to sync within a LAN instead of over the net, avoiding complexities you might not have considered like NAT traversal. &nbsp;It's not that it's so simple; it's actually a very sophisticated execution. &nbsp;It's just that those parts aren't necessarily visible (and no, many of its competitors were not as clever).</p>
<p>Now, this is minimalism, in a sense. &nbsp;But it's not the sort of minimalism pointed to in the Quora answer, which amounts to &quot;Let's offer fewer features than those other jerks and we'll all get rich!&quot; &nbsp;It's more about doing things that are sophisticated and difficult, and not wasting time on UI afterthoughts.</p>
<p>It was 2006 when S3 launched, but a few years isn't THAT long for a specialized market to shake out. &nbsp;Besides, S3 prices have been falling since its launch, so it could've either been a lack of investment in the synced-storage space or just the need to wait for a cheaper equilibrium point that delayed the rise of a winner in the space. &nbsp;At some point a critical mass was reached and brand recognition took over.</p>
<p>Anyway, Amazon's contribution to web infrastructure is the key here. &nbsp;Its transformative field-leveling effect on the industry (and the web's increasing reliance on it) is a story that ought to be explored more in the popular press. &nbsp;AWS deserves a bit more of the concern that Google commonly attracts for its market power.</p>

<p>I'm sorry, but no. <a class="reference external" href="http://www.slate.com/id/2281146/pagenum/all/">It's a lousy polemic</a>. Here's its structure:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>SEO-friendly statement of controversy</li>
<li>Presentation of opinion A. Assertion that people who hold it are rubes.</li>
<li>Presentation of opinion B. Invocation of authority.</li>
<li>History lesson! Discussion of old technology; no mention of enforcement of author's preferred orthodoxy by newer technology (e.g. HTML rendering multiple spaces as one)</li>
<li>Rumination on beauty. Grecian urns, etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>For now let's ignore the ignore the bullying nature of this argument (it should be obvious to anyone that those of us who believe in two spaces are a minority that's relentlessly and mercilessly persecuted by the bloodthirsty masses, both through jeremiads like Manjoo's and through the technological eradication of our ability to express our beliefs). Which of the points in the above argument are rhetorically meaningful?</p>
<p>Only point 3 really carries any weight with me. I'll take Manjoo's word that all typographers like a single space between sentences. I'm actually pretty sympathetic to arguments from authority, being the big-state-loving paternalist that I am. But, with apologies to friends and colleagues of mine who care passionately about this stuff, I lost my patience with the typographically-obsessed community when they started trying to get me to pay attention to which sans-serif fonts were being used anachronistically on <em>Mad Men</em>.</p>
<p>I love you guys, but you're crazy. On questions of aesthetic preference there's no particular reason that normal people should listen to a bunch of geeky obsessives who spend orders of magnitude more time on these issues than average. It's like how you probably shouldn't listen to me when I tell you not to use .doc files or that you might want to consider a digital audio player with Ogg Vorbis support. I strongly believe those things, but even I know they're pointless and arbitrary for everyone who doesn't consider &quot;Save As...&quot; an opportunity for political action.</p>
<p>Nor should we assume that just because typographers believe earnestly in the single space that their belief is held entirely in good faith. They're drunk on the awesome power of their proportional fonts, and sure of the cosmic import of the minuscule kerning decisions that it is their lonely duty to make. <em>Of course</em> they don't want lowly typists exercising their opinions about letter spacing. Those people aren't qualified to have opinions!</p>
<p>(For what it's worth, I don't think you rabble should be using Flash or Silverlight or anything other than plain text in your emails. You can't be trusted with it! And, not that this motivates me or typographers at all of course (we just want what's best for you), but when you do such things it makes my job slightly harder.)</p>
<p>Manjoo's argument about beauty, like all such arguments, is easy enough to dismiss: I disagree. I find it easier to read paragraphs that are composed of sentences separated by two spaces. Perhaps this is because I, like most technologists, spend most of my time working with (quite lovely!) fixed-width fonts for practical reasons. But there's also a deeper beauty to the two space rule -- a sort of mathematical beauty. Let me explain.</p>
<p>Consider the typical structure of writing. Letters are assembled into words, which turn into phrases, which are arranged into sentences -- at the same time being assigned to speakers, a neat trick -- which are then combined into paragraphs.</p>
<p>It's a chemical process, a perfect and infinitely flexible hierarchical system that should command our admiration. Being able to rationally examine, disassemble and interrogate the final product is a mark of the system's beauty. Anything less is settling for a sort of holistic mysticism.</p>
<p>It's disrespectful to let writing's constituent elements bleed into one another through imprecise demarcations. If you see me &quot;making mistakes with comma placement&quot;, please rest assured that I'm doing it deliberately. In most cases the comma doesn't belong to the phrase delimited by the quotation marks that enclose it. Placing an exclamation point or question mark to the left or right of a close-quote is a weighty decision! That we violate the atomic purity of quotations with injected commas is an outrage.</p>
<p>And though I don't get quite as worked up about it, the same sort of thinking motivates my belief in the double space. Sentences deserve to be clearly delineated, but because of the complications of quotation, ellipses, interrogatives and exclamations (among others), there is no reliable punctuation that can be counted on as a terminator for sentences. Single spaces are already spoken for: they separate words. The double space is an elegant and subtle solution.</p>
<p>To operationalize it: I can split any of the paragraphs in this post (as composed, not as rendered) into its constituent sentences with a simple line of Python:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">[cc lang=&quot;python&quot;]</div>
<div class="line">for x in paragraph.split(' '):</div>
<div class="line">print repr(x)</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">&quot;And though I don't get quite as worked up about it, the same sort of thinking motivates my belief in the double space.&quot;</div>
<div class="line">&quot;Sentences deserve to be clearly delineated, but because of the complications of quotation, ellipses, interrogatives and exclamations (among others), there is no reliable punctuation that can be counted on as a terminator for sentences.&quot;</div>
<div class="line">&quot;Single spaces are already spoken for: they separate words.&quot;</div>
<div class="line">&quot;The double space is an elegant and subtle solution.&quot;</div>
<div class="line">[/cc]</div>
</div>
<p>Further disassembly is easy from there. I can't do that with the degenerate text that Manjoo prefers. As a journalist who makes his living on consumers' pageviews it's perhaps understandable that he would deliberately complicate news consumption for his non-human audience. But I hope the rest of us can make our aesthetic decisions a little less selfishly.</p>

                    <p>It's a little pointless to speculate about where the Arizona shooter got some of his super-crazy ideas: presumably he will eventually be medicated and/or interviewed enough to simply tell us. Still, the press's sudden fascination with David Wynn Miller strikes me as a little over-eager. There isn't really much evidence tying him to Loughner. Yes, both men seem to have strange ideas about the government using grammar as a means of mind control. It seems perfectly possible -- maybe likely -- that Miller's the source of that. But for what it's worth, I think we probably shouldn't rule out simultaneous, uh, discovery.</p>
<p>It's just that Miller's ravings aren't as novel as they might seem. Consider <a class="reference external" href="http://www.timecube.com/">timecube.com</a> (it's a lot sadder to read than it was a couple of days ago). In this case the author is convinced the government is exerting control through a conspiracy centered around the 12 hour clock. There's also plenty of railing against evil educators, biblical allusions and specious logic.</p>
<p>In Gene Ray's case it's the clock, not grammar. But it could easily have been grammar. This kind of sickness seems more about obsessive and broken thought than conceptual synthesis. Whatever bibliography we generate is going to be meaningless, and it seems a bit ludicrous to be playing name-your-influences as if Loughner had just released a debut album.</p>

<p>Libet's work isn't the conclusive case against free will that it might seem at first blush. Neural evidence of motor planning can occur without resulting action; such planning may not occur in the same way for different types of decisions; and you can come up with various free-will-as-last-minute-veto accounts that strike me as pretty lame but seem to make some people feel better. You don't <em>have</em> to accept conscious experience as an epiphenomenon. Still, I've always found the result a great means of attaining a mild but pervasive sense of existential worry, which I think is worthwhile on its own merits.</p>
<p>I was prompted (through a clear chain of causation!) to search for the video after reading <a class="reference external" href="http://www.concatenation.org/futures/whatsexpected.pdf">this</a> (PDF), via <a class="reference external" href="http://chneukirchen.org/trivium/2011-01-04">Trivium</a>. It's short and worth a look. It descends into improbable and grandiose flourishes after the first column (people like me would keep a Predictor on their keychain and then get on with their lives). But with all the excitement over <a class="reference external" href="http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2010/11/feeling-the-future-is-precognition-possible/">Daryl Bem's paper</a> that's arisen during the last few months, I'm feeling pretty good about my odds of being able to buy a Predictor-like gadget from <a class="reference external" href="http://www.dealextreme.com/">DealExtreme</a> in the next decade or two.</p>

                    <p>It was good to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.wired.com/magazine/2010/12/ff_angrynerd_geekculture/">read this</a> (via the great&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/#!/incanus77">Justin Miller</a>). In it, Patton Oswalt laments the cooption of geek culture by the masses. He lovingly describes his youth as a Northern Virginian Otaku, and laments that culture’s adoption by the mainstream.</p>
<p>I’m sympathetic, but Oswalt is totally wrong. It’s not a problem that jocks like <em>Watchmen</em> or <em>Buffy</em> or whatever else. It’s great that they do. If something has artistic value, it should be enjoyed by as many people as possible.</p>
<p>I get that this stuff feels like a life raft to teenagers in legitimate pain; that it provides a sense of identity for outcasts. I was one of those kids. But I’ve reluctantly concluded that it’s not healthy to create these islands of identity. Imbuing pop culture with value, then borrowing that value for yourself — it’s not a winning formula. If kids who can throw footballs know who Boba Fett is, and if that cuts the legs out from under some aspiring introverts… I guess I think that that’s a good thing, even if it’s painful for them in the moment.</p>
<p>Oswalt’s lamenting the destruction of the nerd ghetto, and proposing that we build a new one. That’s an understandable impulse, but it’s wrong. Undercutting the drive to self-victimize can appear cruel when considered in the context of young people’s deliberate and inevitable victimization of one another. But the alternative isn’t really mercy; it’s just assisted masochism.</p>

                    <p>I'm a bit late to this, but for the record: it's extremely disappointing to see the most important cyclist advocacy organization in the city <a class="reference external" href="http://waba.org/blog/2010/12/resolve-to-set-the-stage-for-even-stronger-advocacy-in-2011/">concern trolling its own members</a>. &nbsp;As others have noted at length, the proposed pledge to more lawful behavior is both insulting and potentially unwise:&nbsp;complete and mechanical obedience to the rules of the road can be dangerous in its own right. &nbsp;I'd say I'm pretty scrupulous about following the law -- dorky hand signals and everything! -- but if you think I'm going to hang out in a left turn lane facing a red light but no oncoming traffic, waiting for someone to plow into me from behind, you're nuts.</p>
<p>I get pretty upset when I see someone salmoning up a one-way street or failing to yield the right of way, but the actual incidence of serious cyclist misbehavior seems to me to be relatively small. &nbsp;In the same way that many motorists habitually execute rolling stops, or fail to signal, or go five miles over the speed limit, cyclists commit a lot of offenses that don't represent serious safety problems. &nbsp;No one spends much time bemoaning drivers' peccadilloes because we're used to them. &nbsp;But first-hand experience of biking through the city is still pretty rare. It's unfortunate, but I think that without such experience, drivers are unqualified to weigh in on what constitutes dangerous behavior, and consequently overstate the problem of cyclist recklessness to an astounding degree. &nbsp;In perfect world everyone would make at least a few commutes using each mode (and in the presence of users of other modes) before engaging with this topic.</p>
<p>Motorists often mistake their own surprise for evidence of a safety problem. &nbsp;This is understandable; we should all resolve to surprise each other as little as possible on the road. &nbsp;But sometimes a driver's surprise represents proof of a cyclist's erratic behavior, and sometimes it's just evidence of the driver's lack of experience around bikes.</p>
<p>I think folks behind the wheel are used to having responsibility vested with them. &nbsp;As is often repeated, they're in control of deadly weapons. &nbsp;A burden of responsibility is understandably placed on them, rather than pedestrians. &nbsp;Unfortunately, the speed and vulnerability of cyclists combined with drivers' inexperience around them makes this two-party arrangement untenable. &nbsp;Cyclists have to adopt a patronizing attitude toward people in cars: to declare themselves the judges of how the street should be navigated. We're the most vulnerable; no one else is willing to take charge of keeping us safe. &nbsp;If we decline that responsibility, it's our own asses.</p>
<p>This isn't an ideal state of affairs. &nbsp;The burden should be shared, and codified by law. And it really can be that way! &nbsp;I rode in the Netherlands this fall; that's how things work there. But that experience was both inspiring and depressing: believe me when I say that we are nowhere near ready to rely wholly on the rules of the road in the way that American drivers and all of the Dutch are able to (the only time I have been hit by a car as an adult, I was completely in compliance with the law; the driver simply didn't expect a bike to be there). &nbsp;The current situation will obtain in most American cities for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>Besides, sharing the road is a pain in the ass. &nbsp;That's just the truth: it would be a lot more convenient for me if there weren't any cars in the street, and it would be a lot more convenient for the drivers of those cars if I walked to work. &nbsp;That's just how it goes. &nbsp;Some folks in cars are never going to be happy that I'm on the street, on a bike.</p>
<p>Safely navigating the city on a bike and keeping drivers happy are goals that are somewhat in tension. &nbsp;Trying to meet drivers' motivated and at times incoherent expectations is a losing proposition. &nbsp;Changing those expectations is the only way forward, and the only way to do that is to get more bikes on the road. &nbsp;I wish WABA's staff was focused on that task instead of spending time scolding the people they're supposed to be representing.</p>

                    <p>I had some interesting Twitter conversations this morning about <a class="reference external" href="http://travel.usatoday.com/flights/post/2010/12/american-airlines-orbitz/135972/1?csp=34travel&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+TP-TodayInTheSky+(Travel+-+Today+In+the+Sky)">American Airlines' departure from Orbitz</a>. <a class="reference external" href="http://consumerist.com/2010/12/american-airlines-yanks-fares-from-orbitz.html">Various sites</a> seem to be pissed off at AA for this, presumably because they interpret any additional consumer inconvenience as the likely result of a greedy corporate cash grab. That's not a terrible rule of thumb, but in this case the situation is a little more complicated.</p>
<p>On the one hand, you've got online ticket agents (OTAs) like Orbitz, Kayak and the like. On the other you've got the airlines. In between are the <strong>global distribution systems (GDSes)</strong>. These are the centralized reservation databases that are used by airline staff when they have to book you a new flight on another airline; they're the things that were used by travel agents back when travel agents still existed. The OTAs use them, too -- though the situation here gets a little bit complicated, as some of the OTAs are in bed with and/or wholly owned by the GDSes. GDSes aren't just price aggregator: they do various complicated things like hold tickets for you while you're in the process of checking out through a travel site. They're sort of like stock exchanges for airline tickets.</p>
<p>The key thing to realize is this: the GDSes are old systems, and represent something that is at least a bit cartel-<em>like</em>. They introduce friction; they charge fees. They're middlemen who serve other middlemen. If we can manage it, eliminating our collective reliance on them would be a good idea. Disintermediation should benefit the consumer!</p>
<p>As I understand it, American Airlines is asking the travel search engines to talk to AA's systems directly instead of going through a GDS. Perhaps this is a temporary tactic that's being used to put pressure on a particular GDS as AA renegotiates the terms of their contract. Perhaps it's an earnest effort to begin tearing down the overcomplicated system currently governing airline booking. I don't know. What I do know is that AA is getting a pretty raw deal in the media. I find it astounding that any reporter could be so credulous as to write <a class="reference external" href="http://www.tnooz.com/2010/12/23/news/expedia-removes-american-airlines-fares-in-support-of-orbitz/">this story</a>. Expedia's offering moral support to Orbitz? Right. Sure.</p>
<p>So look, I don't know how much goodwill AA deserves in this situation. But all that they're asking Orbitz to do is talk to their systems directly. This would involve some technical work by Orbitz, but would allow for the elimination of a Ticketmaster-like entity that's currently involved in the purchase of air travel. That could potentially mean lower prices. What they're <em>not</em> doing is saying, &quot;Sorry consumer, I don't care about the extra hassle I'm causing you; you're just going to have to search for and buy tickets straight from our own site so that I can avoid paying any helpful search engines a booking fee.&quot; (This, incidentally, is exactly what Southwest, jetBlue and various other discount airlines used to/still do, but for some reason it didn't stop anyone from loving them). If they were doing that, I'd be a lot more sympathetic to the hue and cry that's being kicked up. As it is, this is just a business flexing its muscle to get out from under a gatekeeper's thumb. I'm all for it.</p>

                    <p>I’ve been following the “Do Not Track” discussion with interest. I’m not sure I have any particularly strong feelings about the proposed implementations, but I’m curious to see what happens. And of course it’s been hilarious, as always, to see some of the knee-jerk pro-corporate responses that the policy proposal has prompted.</p>
<p>There’s an aspect of the debate that I briefly tweeted at Harlan Yu, and I guess it might be worth expanding on a bit. Consider an excerpt from <a class="reference external" href="http://techliberation.com/2010/12/03/do-not-track%E2%80%93-a-single-%E2%80%9Cnuclear%E2%80%9D-response-for-a-diversity-of-choices/">this post</a> over at TLF:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The FTC’s report calls for a “uniform and comprehensive” way for consumers to decide whether they want their activities tracked. The Commission points to a Do Not Track system consisting of browser settings that would be respected by web tracking services. A user could select one setting in Firefox, for example, to opt out of all tracking online. The FTC wrongly calls this “universal choice.”</p>
<p>Really, it’s a universal response. It’s a single response to an overly-simplified set of choices we encounter on the web. This single response means that tracking for the purpose of tailored advertising is either “on” or “off.” There is no middle setting. But it is the “middle” where we want consumers to be. The middle setting would represent an educated setting where consumers understand the tradeoffs of interest-based advertising – in return for tracking your preferences and using them to target ads to you, you get free content/services. But an on/off switch is too blunt and not, err, targeted enough. There is no incentive for consumers to learn about the positives, they’ll only fear the worst-case scenarios and will opt-out. In return they’ll also opt-out of the benefits. [more on the “middle” below].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Aside: can we please stop with the transparent attempts to frame the debate in a self-serving way through use of the word “nuclear”? Everyone knows what you’re doing, dude.)</p>
<p>Let me quibble with the free content/services bit embedded here. Implicit in this assertion is the idea that advertisers’ ability to possess better information about consumer behavior allows ads to be more precisely targeted, making the ads more valuable to the businesses that place them. This increases the revenue available to ad-supported industries, many of which provide valuable content or services through what is a de facto tax on businesses.</p>
<p>I think the evidence for this dynamic is weaker than a lot of people suspect. As far as I can tell, it’s all based on Google. GOOG showed up and provided contextualized ads to consumers and a model that allowed advertisers to only pay for purchases that were “working”. This is pretty much the only way they make money, and they make a lot of it.</p>
<p>But Google’s a huge success in a landscape of failure. Online ads sell for pathetic rates relative to broadcast or print. This is because by all accounts online advertising doesn’t work very well. You can measure whether someone clicks on an ad, and often whether they buy something after that click. But it turns out they rarely do those things. So businesses aren’t willing to pay very much for ad space on websites.</p>
<p>Is it really a coincidence that the advertising medium with the best instrumentation also appears to be the least effective? I suspect it’s not. It may be that ads never worked as well as the industry had told us; or it may be that the eyeballs/clicks/conversions funnel is a naive conceptualization of how the system works. Either way, Google has succeeded by giving advertisers what they <em>think</em> they want, which is analytic tools that seem to reveal that the whole enterprise is horribly ineffective.</p>
<p>I think the push for better tools and more efficient ads is basically a race to the bottom. In fact, less perfect instrumentation might allow the ad industry to capture a bit more revenue from business thanks to decreased efficiency. If I’m right, those in the business of selling ads should be excited about initiatives like Do Not Track. I don’t think it’s conceivable that the market will cease pursuing greater efficiencies unless this kind of regulatory intervention occurs.</p>
<p>It might sound a little strange to hear me sign off on the government propping up an industry I detest. Honestly, advertising is a big reason I find myself on the liberal side of the corporate/state distrust spectrum. There aren’t many things I find more odious than cynical attempts to manipulate people’s thoughts and desires — especially when it’s done using quirks of biology and psychology. Our anti-propaganda norms make it quite clear that we don’t tolerate such manipulation from government; when examples of it are revealed, they’re harshly criticized and punished. Yet we accept as perfectly normal the idea of such manipulations being pursued by private entities, who are free to try to cajole us into doing things contrary to our own interests, and without any mechanisms for controlling them other than the adeliberate market and (viciously resisted) regulation.</p>
<p>It’s a bit weird. Distressingly weird! So I think preserving personal privacy is probably worth the introduction of this kind of inefficiency. And I think the preservation of the media creation business is desirable, and I don’t really believe in any models for accomplishing this except some sort of (probably convoluted) public subsidy. If I’m right, decreasing the efficiency of advertising will act as a de facto tax on businesses which choose to advertise. We’ll consequently pay slightly more for products sold by such businesses, and the difference will help pay for our magazines and newspapers and web videos and music. I think that’d be an okay deal.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>Earlier tonight I tweeted something snide about &quot;Big Data.&quot; &nbsp;Some people actually replied! &nbsp;This was a useful reminder that Twitter is not just a black hole into which bile can be thrown. &nbsp;It also made me realize that I should probably explain my thinking a bit more.</p>
<p>At this point, I consider software development to be a trade. &nbsp;It's easy to pretend otherwise, what with so many of us having degrees in computer &quot;science&quot; and the fact -- often only apparent to practitioners -- that a program's implementation can reflect an aesthetic sensibility. &nbsp;But in truth those of us who work in the industry perform tasks that are a lot more like the work of an electrician or plumber than that of a sculptor or theoretical physicist. We apply a relatively small number of solutions to an almost infinite landscape of problems. &nbsp;There's still plenty of room for variation and artistry in the execution -- there's more than one way to skin a cat -- but it really is about deploying specialized tools to solve applied engineering problems.</p>
<p>Ted Dziuba once wrote something like &quot;scalability is the problem that every software engineer wishes he had, and ten actually do.&quot; &nbsp;There's something to this, but it's a bit unfair to the people who wish they had the problem. &nbsp; A run-of-the-mill web developer studying scalability is a bit like a construction carpenter studying Amish furniture making techniques. &nbsp;Is it relevant to his work? &nbsp;Well, strictly speaking, no. &nbsp;He just needs to be able to tack up frames so the drywall guys can come by. &nbsp;Still, if you're choosing which carpenter to hire to help build a townhouse, it might not be a bad idea to pick the guy who's interested in learning about dovetail joints and how to build a dresser without using any nails or screws. &nbsp;To be clear: this is not where the guy's talents are actually needed. &nbsp;He could be rebuilding houses in Haiti, or New Orleans, or wherever. &nbsp;There are plenty of problems that need his skills. &nbsp;Still, there's nothing wrong with a guy taking pride and interest in his craft.</p>
<p>And that's about where we are with software developers interested in scalability, or Big Data, or whatever. &nbsp;Interest in esoteric topics is healthy! &nbsp;It shows that a person is engaged and anxious to learn. &nbsp;A very few of those people actually will need to build dovetail joints someday. &nbsp;And yeah, they could probably just learn once the need arises. &nbsp;But it's not a particularly grievous misallocation of resources for them to learn now instead of later.</p>
<p>But things get a little dodgier once you get beyond this circle of technologist self-betterment. &nbsp;It is not particularly helpful, for instance, to start writing news stories about how the future of carpentry is the phase-out of screws, and how in the future no firm that hasn't prepared itself and its employees for the screwless economy is going to be able to compete. &nbsp;It's just not true. &nbsp;Some smart people are interested in this stuff, but that doesn't mean it's about to transform the industry.</p>
<p>So, look: Big Data. &nbsp;Do some people genuinely deal with this class of problem? &nbsp;Yes, some do. &nbsp;Many more, myself included, wish they did: I get as excited as anybody else by the idea of marshaling huge quantities of information to reach interesting conclusions! &nbsp;The problem here is really just the &quot;big&quot; part. &nbsp;Computers are <em>so</em> powerful. &nbsp;How big does a problem need to be before a single machine is an impractical solution? &nbsp;The answer is: very, very, VERY big. &nbsp;For instance, I've got the last ten years of federal spending data on the laptop on which I'm typing this. &nbsp;That's about 31 million rows of data. &nbsp;That's a lot! &nbsp;But it's still nowhere near the point where I'd need to pursue exotic optimizations for my queries. &nbsp;Most startups do not do as much business as the federal government; and most well-designed systems don't need to constantly query a huge working set of data. &nbsp;I can't help but wonder whether we'd be better off spending more time teaching each other how to run regressions, or just calculate a confidence interval (how big do you need that data to be before you can arrive at a decent answer, anyway?).</p>
<p>But this is just my own sense of the matter. &nbsp;The fact is that I don't do a ton of work in this area. &nbsp;Perhaps I'm way off-base here! &nbsp;But I kind of get the sense that engineers are getting excited about interesting things, and others are concluding that those interesting things are <em>broadly important</em> things. &nbsp;It's not always so.</p>

</p><p>Halloween is kind of a big deal for me. This year I was sad not to be able to throw an enormous party, but it did give me an opportunity to put some more thought into my costume than usual.</p>
<p>I always go as something comic-book-related; typically I go as a super-villain (I broke that tradition last year and sort of regretted doing so). In the past I've chosen characters based on my personal affinity for them and a balance between the feasibility and potential awesomeness of the costume. I kind of ignored that this time. This year I went as Dr. Manhattan. Like every other self-respecting geek, I love <em>Watchmen</em>, and there were some personal resonances that made me want to go as doc.</p>
<p>I'm supposed to be dressed <a class="reference external" href="/static/2010/10/31/watchmen_source-20101031-202344.png">the way Dr. Manhattan was when he made a TV appearance in the comic</a>. There isn't anything particularly important about that scene -- it's just the only one where he isn't naked (I wasn't <em>that</em> committed to the project).</p>
<p>I think people tend to have a confused reaction to Dr. Manhattan when reading the book. It's very tempting to view him as a sympathetic character. For one thing, he's omnipotent, and people naturally find themselves sucking up to all-powerful authority figures. Also, his backstory does make him something of a victim. Finally, he's helpless -- in a sense -- and people mistake helplessness for innocence. But this is a bad judgment. In truth the guy's actions are abhorrent both before and after his self-imposed exile. So I feel comfortable including him in the &quot;villain&quot; costume list.</p>
<p>At any rate, the costume was well-received, though most often as &quot;blue man&quot; or &quot;blue man group&quot; (on the way home a woman yelled out to me that her brother-in-law is an <em>actual</em> blue man group blue man, an admission that I think left us both embarrassed). Choosing a costume that's so thoroughly makeup-based is definitely a pain in the ass -- I think it'll be a few years before I go down that road again. And to be honest, people mostly just liked the contact lenses: they worked great, thoroughly disturbed people, and seem not to have blinded me. And hey! <a class="reference external" href="http://www.bodyjewelleryshop.com/online_store/white-mesh-contact-lenses-pair.cfm">At a mere $25</a>, I think they're well worth the investment. A+++, would stick into my eyes again.</p>

                    <p>It's a very good movie. You should go see it.&nbsp; I don't have much more to say about it than that.</p>
<p>What I do want to observe, though, is that the reaction to the movie on Twitter has been fascinating.&nbsp; A surprising number of people are leaping to Zuckerberg's defense.&nbsp; Many are linking to <a class="reference external" href="http://gawker.com/5643915/mark-zuckerberg-describes-the-dirty-tricks-that-led-to-the-facebook-movie">this account</a> of the legal maneuvering dramatized by the film -- an account which doesn't actually exculpate Zuckerberg, but is written as if the author thinks it does.&nbsp; Even more astounding are posts like <a class="reference external" href="http://alexpriest.com/2010/10/04/perhaps-the-digital-divide-is-much-bigger-than-we-thought/">this one</a>, which lionize Zuckerberg as a sort of Nietzschean hero.</p>
<p>It's all a little weird.&nbsp; People clearly have reservoirs of affection for and identification with the founder of Facebook. Presumably this is because of what his invention means to them.&nbsp; I suppose that's fine.</p>
<p>But let me offer my predictable cranky technologist perspective.&nbsp; Zuckerberg is wildly successful, and I don't begrudge him that.&nbsp; Nor do I find myself particularly outraged on behalf of the various people he seems to have betrayed, all of whom are now even more astoundingly wealthy than they started out being.</p>
<p>There's a strange tendency in this country to declare everyone who's <em>extremely rich</em> to be some sort of visionary genius, whose unprecedented perspective allowed a break from the chains of history.&nbsp; This is ridiculous.&nbsp; Mark Zuckerberg did not invent social networking.&nbsp; His achievement at Harvard wasn't even that remarkable: 400 unique visitors to a just-launched website is great, but hardly unprecedented.&nbsp; Nor are his technological achievements all that impressive: assuming the movie's depiction to be accurate -- and I suspect it basically is, judging by the tasks he was performing -- he seems like a strong web developer, but not any kind of wunderkind (Facebook's ability to operate at its current scale using a hugely rewritten version of PHP is a genuinely impressive achievement, but the entry-level LAMP stuff Zuckerberg himself did is simple enough).</p>
<p>What Facebook did was deploy an extremely effective marketing scheme -- one based on exclusivity -- at exactly the right&nbsp; moment.&nbsp; From there, network effects took over and delivered success.&nbsp; This is an impressive commercial achievement, but it is not a triumph of vision or technical skill.&nbsp; <a class="reference external" href="http://www.danah.org/papers/talks/PDF2009.html">Depending on your perspective, you might not even consider it to be particularly admirable</a>.</p>
<p>In the absence of Zuckerberg, <a class="reference external" href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/ezra-klein/2010/10/zuckerberg_zuckerberg_zuckerbe.html">someone else would have almost certainly come along and stolen Myspace's thunder</a> -- just as someone or something will surely supplant Facebook before its <a class="reference external" href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/2585-facebook-is-not-worth-33000000000">ludicrous valuation</a> is realized.&nbsp; Zuckerberg is not one of history's great men -- he's just one of its richest.</p>

                    <p>I'm taking some grim satisfaction in the dissolution of the Haystack Project. If people have actually been hurt by this software, I'll be removing the &quot;satisfaction&quot; part of that reaction.&nbsp; But given the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2010/06/07/the_twitter_revolution_that_wasnt">relentless overhyping</a> of technological interventions in pro-democratic organizing, I'm hopeful that little actual damage has been done.&nbsp; These technologies will no doubt soon become genuinely crucial to people living under repressive governments, but I'm optimistic that Heap's work didn't spread far enough to cause serious trouble.</p>

<li>The twitter stream of &#64;ioerror, beginning at <a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/ioerror/status/24425326976">this tweet</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I think Nancy's piece raises the most important questions: why did the media -- and more importantly, the federal government -- fall for Austin Heap's bullshit?&nbsp; Here I disagree with Nancy: I don't think it's just a question of technical expertise.&nbsp; I've been <a class="reference external" href="/2010/06/10/checking-in-on-twitter-and-iran/">skeptical</a> of <a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/sbma44/statuses/20716325414">Haystack</a> since its announcement, but I couldn't write a secure crypto proxy to save my life.&nbsp; That stuff is really hard.</p>
<p>But here's the thing: the technology is hard, but it's also <em>done</em>.&nbsp; Smart people have looked at these problems and have solved the ones that are solvable.&nbsp; There's work left to be done at the edges -- better hash algorithms, that kind of thing -- but I guarantee that's not the sort of flaw that's afflicting Haystack.</p>
<p>The thing to realize is that good security is a set of patterns.&nbsp; Relatively few of them have to do with technology (although learning about the technology behind security systems can certainly help you understand the patterns).&nbsp; The media's naivete springs from the idea that the right app could liberalize Iran.&nbsp; Ignorance of the app's internals is a much smaller problem than the sort of wishful thinking that gets that story pitched and approved (and read).&nbsp; Recognizing a snake oil salesman is just as important as recognizing an exploit.</p>
<p>Alarms should have gone off when Heap announced he was writing new software.&nbsp; Why write software?&nbsp; We have software.&nbsp; Did Heap think the limitations of Tor and Freenet and Freegate and PGP and all the others exist because those tools' authors are lazy or stupid?&nbsp; That was never the problem.</p>
<p>I guess what I'm trying to say is that reporters should spend more time reading <a class="reference external" href="http://www.schneier.com/">Bruce Schneier</a>.&nbsp; Even the repetitive entries. <em>Especially</em> the repetitive entries.</p>

                    <p>I'm not in much of a blogging mood, but I wanted to get this down now, with a timestamp, so I can say &quot;I told you so&quot; in 9 months: <em>app</em> is going to become a dirty word.</p>
<p>At work I've been fielding a number of calls from tech companies who would like us to develop a version of one of our offerings customized to their upcoming platform -- whether mobile, or web-based, or (most ridiculously) centered around a particularly power-efficient x86 processor.&nbsp; This enthusiasm is a testament to the quality of the work my colleagues do and to the excitement currently surrounding the open gov space.&nbsp; Both of those are wonderful things!&nbsp; And to be clear, I intend to take advantage of some of these opportunities.&nbsp; There is publicity to be had. In some cases I think that saying &quot;yes&quot; is the rational, self-interested thing to do.</p>
<p>But only insofar as it allows us to take advantage of an essentially irrational trend.&nbsp; It is increasingly clear to me that, in the fall and winter, exclusive&quot; app stores will begin proliferating at a pace that is unjustifiable, and which will likely lead, appropriately, to the concept of &quot;apps&quot; and &quot;app stores&quot; being denigrated and then stigmatized.</p>
<p>Companies have looked at the runaway success of Apple's mobile application distribution model and found themselves slavering.&nbsp; Nevermind that the mobile space, and Apple, and their first-mover advantage are all unique.&nbsp; These copycats are going to try to recreate that success.&nbsp; Everyone can have their own walled garden!&nbsp; Every platform will be exclusive and revolutionary!&nbsp; An no, of course we're not trying to lock anybody in to anything. Why would you even think such a thing?</p>
<p>It's heinous, it's stupid, and it's contrary to the norms that have made the internet as great and powerful as it is.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>To get philosophical for a moment, all this is an iteration of one of a handful of archetypal technology debates -- in this case, <em>open versus closed</em>.&nbsp; The thing is, this is a very boring debate: we know that the answer is &quot;almost always open&quot;, and we've known it for a while.&nbsp; I'd much prefer to go back to <em>fat client versus thin client</em> (aka &quot;the cloud will change everything forever and I have the powerpoint to prove it&quot;).&nbsp; That debate is at least deservedly cyclical, driven by the ebb and flow of processing power, storage, technology's social ubiquity and, more recently, battery life and wireless bandwidth.&nbsp; We'll probably arrive at an answer there, too, but not before we get a bit closer to the fundamental physical limits constraining our technologies and/or nervous systems.</p>

<p>This makes me wonder, though, about the compensation structure of top-tier professional writers.&nbsp; I have a hard time believing that Charles Murray is feeling the financial pinch of the collapsing media industry, his complaints about Times op-ed rates notwithstanding.&nbsp; It seems a lot more likely to me that his compensation has shifted away from writing-for-hire and toward various cushy sinecures.&nbsp; Rich people tend to have friends who'll help them stay rich, after all.&nbsp; I have a feeling that <a class="reference external" href="http://www.chicagobusiness.com/cgi-bin/news.pl?id=33794">the way things went down at the Chicago Tribune</a> is fairly typical.&nbsp; Or maybe I just took that last season of The Wire a bit too much to heart.</p>

                    <p>So!&nbsp; At work we've been spending a couple of days working on off-the-wall projects -- it's a change of pace, a chance to work with folks not on our usual teams, an opportunity to try out new ideas, and a venue for some friendly competition.</p>
<p>One of the projects that my team considered but ultimately discarded was some sentiment analysis on on press statements made by legislators about the BP oil spill.&nbsp; I figured we could pull some press releases, scan them for their level of aggression (or whatever) and compare the results to the level of oil industry support enjoyed by that legislator (thanks, <a class="reference external" href="http://transparencydata.com/">Transparency Data</a>!).&nbsp; The result probably wouldn't have set the world aflame, but if it turned out the way I expected it might've made for a fun and topical visualization.</p>
<p>As I said, we didn't end up pursuing that idea.&nbsp; But I did get far enough in researching sentiment analysis to realize that I'd like to use the ANEW dataset -- a spatial model of various emotionally-charged words that would help me classify arbitrary texts.&nbsp; Now, Emily says that she thinks sentiment analysis is &quot;kind of bullshit&quot;, and I'm not sure I disagree.&nbsp; But I think it might still be interesting to run the numbers and see what comes up.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the folks who created ANEW <a class="reference external" href="http://csea.phhp.ufl.edu/media/anewmessage.html">don't want to give their data away</a>.&nbsp; Well, that's not quite right: they'll give it away, for free, if you're a researcher.&nbsp; A researcher who has a .edu email address.&nbsp; And who isn't a student.</p>
<p>This seems a little silly to me.&nbsp; And it seems <em>really</em> silly when you consider that their <a class="reference external" href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Affective%20norms%20for%20English%20words%20%28ANEW%29%3A%20Instruction%20manual%20and%20affective%20ratings&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;sa=N&amp;hl=en&amp;tab=ws">widely-available 1999 paper introducing ANEW</a> contains a complete data set.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="/2007/10/16/hypem-revivified-then-vivisected/">You can probably see where this is going</a>.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="/static/2010/06/anew-1999.tar.gz">Here's the data in CSV format</a>.&nbsp; <a class="reference external" href="http://github.com/sbma44/begin_anew">Here's the code used to generate it</a>. <a class="reference external" href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/757723154j4w726k/fulltext.html">Here's a paper that shows how to use ANEW</a>.</p>
<p>Given the age of the paper its widespread availability, I can't imagine there'll be any objections to transforming its contents slightly into a more useful format. If there are, I'd be happy to hear them in comments -- and if any are made by the folks responsible for ANEW, I'll be happy to remove the link to everything here that contains even a whiff of their copyright.</p>
<p>And of course this is pretty old data.&nbsp; I'm sure that ANEW's gotten better in the last decade (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.sci.sdsu.edu/CAL/wordlist/">this page</a>, for example, refers to ANEW as containing 2000 words; my copy has just over a thousand).&nbsp; But it's something to start with.&nbsp; It'd be great if its creators decided to remove some of the hoops surrounding their list -- there are lots of research efforts that exist outside of the .edu TLD.</p>

                    <p>Alright, a quick poll for those of you who love this album: what have you been listening to it on?&nbsp; The last time I really checked these guys out was when they were being tweeted about endlessly during SXSW.&nbsp; I headed to the Hype Machine and listened to what had been released or leaked.</p>
<p>It was physically unpleasant. I mean, not painful, exactly. That would be going too far.&nbsp; But my old man ears really, <em>really</em> recoiled from it.</p>
<p>But that was all on headphones (sealed-back headphones at that). Today I'm giving the album a chance over speakers, and I have no complaints.&nbsp; I actually like it!&nbsp; And am adding it to my still-extremely-tenuous &quot;2010 = summer of anthemic rock&quot; thesis (Fang Island being the other major data point).</p>
<p>Maybe I'm an outlier here.&nbsp; I still think the clipping is a gimmick, and one that really, really doesn't work without a room full of air to mellow it out.&nbsp; But I'm excited at the prospect of being less of a pain in the ass about this record.</p>
<p>(And yes, I realize that this post constitutes an inevitable but still detestable descent into explicit audiophile pain-in-the-assery.&nbsp; But if you know me you've known for a while that this was only a matter of time.)</p>

<p>But I feel some ambivalence, too.&nbsp; I'm increasingly convinced that it's fruitless to consider social networking products in terms of their absolute, instantaneous attributes.&nbsp; A changed privacy policy is just one small force in a vast landscape of shifting demographics and trends.&nbsp; Considering the situation as if the market is settling down, converging on some stable attractor -- (&quot;blogs and Twitter are the answer and always have been -- now they can take their rightful place!&quot;) -- that's a shallow way of thinking about it.</p>

                    <p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0510/36789.html">This Politico story</a> finishes solidly, but man does it ever start off badly.&nbsp; I suppose I shouldn't expect anything different, but the newspapers' obsession with an imagined era of dispassionate objectivity is now less charmingly eccentric than it is indicative of a distressing disconnection from the fundamental nature of reality.&nbsp; Anyway, <a class="reference external" href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/ezra-klein/2010/05/a_theory_of_bloggers_and_the_m.html">Ezra's take</a> is both smarter and, hopefully, will allow those truth-and-justice-believin-in newspapermen a way to mentally sidestep the dreaded question of partisanship.</p>
<p>In other MSM-bashing news: man, I had a hard time writing the <a class="reference external" href="http://dcist.com/2010/05/morning_roundup_pretty_awful_editio.php">morning roundup</a> today.&nbsp; The latest details from the UVA lacrosse player murder were clearly one of the day's most prominent stories, and I found myself trying to thread the slim gap between condemning the coverage and failing to condemn the murderer.</p>
<p>To be clear: Huguely, having reportedly confessed to the crime, can't be considered anything other than a monster.&nbsp; But I can't help but recoil at the way the Post's editors handled this story.&nbsp; I mean, take a look at <a class="reference external" href="/static/2010/05/05/cartoonish-20100505-130108.png">this</a>.&nbsp; It's cartoonish.&nbsp; If you <a class="reference external" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/05/04/AR2010050402215.html?sid=ST2010050304618">read the story</a> it's clear that the reporters were unable to turn up any really damning quotes about Huguely from anyone who actually knew him or his victim.&nbsp; So instead they hang their case for his obvious villainy on a drunken run-in with the cops where he seems to have mouthed off, then engaged in some violent behavior before or in the course of getting tasered.&nbsp; That's not the mark of a model citizen by any measure, but it's also not an outrageously unusual thing to find on a fraternity member and varsity athlete's resume.</p>
<p>The story goes to even more ridiculous lengths, actually underscoring <em>in the text</em> the disparity between the victim's lovely class photo and Huguely's bedraggled mug shot.</p>
<p>I'm not at all anxious to rehabilitate the image of a murderer.&nbsp; But I do think the Post is doing everyone a disservice by playing up this guy as some sort of transparent villain, skulking through the UVA campus until his dark and brutal nature finally, inevitably, claimed a victim.&nbsp; That sort of laughable oversimplification doesn't help anyone except those who enjoy clucking their tongues and patting themselves on the back -- as if they don't know anyone who could ever perpetrate or fall victim to domestic abuse.</p>
<p>Far more useful would&nbsp; have been an effort to tell the story that seems to be implied by the scant quotes people who actually knew the couple: that all too often people fail to anticipate these tragedies before they occur. Unfortunately, even monstrous human beings rarely appear to be the sort of villainous caricatures that sell newspapers.&nbsp; It's worth taking that idea seriously more seriously than the Post did.</p>

                    <p>Yesterday <a class="reference external" href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2010/04/queueing">Ryan posted</a> about the dread he feels at the prospect of one day having to take his daughter to an amusement park.</p>
<blockquote>
Specifically, I'm dreading the queues. Endless, winding queues, lasting hours, all to ride a roller coaster for two minutes.</blockquote>
<p>He proposes the creation of a market for individual rides -- whether through actual pricing or some sort of scrip -- which would help shorten lines and, hopefully, do a better job of letting customers use the attractions they value most.</p>
<p>I don't like this idea! I am a roller coaster enthusiast -- though each visit to a theme park makes it clearer that adult bodies are physiologically unsuited for such entertainments -- and I would hate to have to participate in a market for rides. I'm sure it would lead to more efficient outcomes in a narrow sense. But the increasing body of literature around the power of &quot;free&quot; as a price point indicates why this would still be a drag: freedom from calculation, judgment and decision-making has utility all its own. This would be no kind of way to run a society, but for entertainment it often makes a lot of sense to excuse people from the burden of weighing pros and cons. Folks really like all-you-can-eat buffets, even if they have to pay a little more. Besides, nobody wants to take their kid to the park and be asked why the rich families don't have to wait in line.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I think technology can save us (surprise!). Disney's got something called <a class="reference external" href="http://disneyworld.disney.go.com/guest-services/fast-pass/">FASTPASS</a> that lets park visitors claim an electronic reservation for a ride, then wander around the park until the appointed time. Limits on the each customers' number of simultaneously-held reservations are enforced to prevent opportunistic oversubscription, and dynamic displays showing the expected wait times help regulate demand across the park's attractions. You spend much less time in line listening to the loud, looping and probably-broken pre-ride video presentation, and the park has successfully put you back into the market for games, concessions and other add-ons. Everyone wins! Plus, with the ubiquity of mobile phones, the up-front cost to implementing such a system is driven way, way down -- all you need to do is hand out some ziploc bags to make the system log flume-compatible.</p>
<p>So there. I think these systems will proliferate, solve Ryan's worry, AND still provide enough interesting data for an econ paper or two. I think everyone can get excited about that.</p>

<p>As he points out, this didn't actually point to any copyright-violating files.&nbsp; The link just discusses the leak.</p>
<p>I don't think this is deliberate suppression of the <em>discussion</em> of piracy.&nbsp; What I think is probably happening is this:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Copyright-holding Corporation A pays Technical Vendor B to monitor Twitter for leaked albums. They can do this cheaply by creating an automated process that looks for band names and the word &quot;leaked&quot;, or through some other simple heuristic.</li>
<li>Matching results are turned into DMCA takedown notices with a minimum (or no?) human intervention.</li>
<li>Twitter receives the notices, removes the user's content and notifies the user with a minimum (or no?) human intervention.</li>
</ol>
<p>The user is then free to make a counterclaim!&nbsp; Unfortunately, there is not a button or script for that.&nbsp; Before long he or she will have to pick up the phone, find a lawyer, and pay that lawyer to fight on their behalf.</p>
<p>This is flatly unacceptable.&nbsp; The need for a DMCA-style simplification of the takedown process is understandable, but this level of automation of the process should not be tolerated.&nbsp; As currently structured, it's a surefire recipe for Type I errors.&nbsp; We've known this about the DMCA takedown process all along, of course, but this really brings it into stark relief -- there's a huge power asymmetry introduced by the DMCA, so much so that the rights-holders it empowers can't even be bothered to follow a link and read a paragraph.&nbsp; Why would they?&nbsp; There's no incentive for them to.</p>
<p>There ought to be substantial sanctions -- payable to the counterclaimant -- that can be recovered when copyright holders suppress legal content through spurious claims.&nbsp; Let's get some of those much-maligned trial lawyers up in here.</p>

                    <p>My colleague Kerry assures me that I am insufferable when I talk about the interesting things I do in an increasingly desperate attempt to forestall... well, whatever [INSERT SUBJECT OF EXISTENTIAL DREAD HERE].</p>
<p>Still, with apologies, I will persist.&nbsp; First, though: Emily tells me that research indicates that the utilitarian return on investment is better for experiential purchases -- things like classes -- than anything else.&nbsp; I believe this!&nbsp; I've been on kind of a class-taking kick lately: surfing, trapeze, microcontroller-programming and now welding.&nbsp; It's working out so far. Take some classes!</p>
<p>But okay, welding.&nbsp; I'm taking a class at the Art League.&nbsp; It's very affordable, but apparently in high demand.&nbsp; The subject is oxy-acetylene welding -- there are opportunities to learn to use MIG and arc welding setups, but the focus is gas welding, which is both easier and less dangerous than those alternatives.</p>
<p>Welding is neat.&nbsp; In the past, I've done quite a bit of soldering, a process in which a low-melting alloy is used to make electrical connections.&nbsp; This background proved to be both helpful and confusing.</p>
<p>It was helpful when cutting metal.&nbsp; This is probably the coolest thing I've done in the class -- it's a very different operation from welding.&nbsp; The oxy-acetylene flame is used to heat the steel to a yellow-hot state, at which point you press a lever on the apparatus that projects a jet of pure oxygen onto the heated spot.&nbsp; The steel then serves as the fuel, sending sparks everywhere.&nbsp; The oxygen both fuels the reaction and physically pushes the molten steel away.&nbsp; It's an interesting trick, playing with metal right at the edge of liquefaction, trying to melt some but <em>not too much</em> of the metal in order to blow away an optimally precise slice of steel.&nbsp; Soldering electrical components can definitely convey an understanding of how metal melts and flows.&nbsp; I was pretty good at cutting right from the start.</p>
<p>I sucked at welding.&nbsp; You learn to be tentative when soldering: you do have to work quickly, before the flux burns off, but in general you learn to be careful about applying heat.&nbsp; Too much and you'll burn the component; better to back off and resolder, if necessary.&nbsp; This isn't the case with welding. You need a lot of heat, and to patiently wait as the structure of the piece begins to collapse, forming an entirely new and unified hunk of metal.&nbsp; It's unnerving to watch this happen.</p>
<p>It gets even worse when you start to incorporate a feeder rod.&nbsp; I'm assured that this makes for a stronger (abeit less attractive) weld than working without one, but it sure is frustrating.&nbsp; When you feed solder into a joint, it dissolves, flows, incorporates.&nbsp; The feeder rod really wants to <em>stick</em>.&nbsp; Gently rocking it back and forth sort of works -- I can see how this will eventually make sense -- but it feels pretty unnatural.&nbsp; Particularly given that your other hand is manipulating an insanely powerful jet of superheated gas.</p>
<p>Anyway!&nbsp; Below is some evidence of my efforts at cutting, and my first and second weld (each of which is half with-rod and half without).&nbsp; It's all quite fascinating, I'm sure.</p>

                    <p>Now it can be said:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Those of you who enjoyed the new Titus Andronicus record -- which should be all of you, as it's really good -- would do well to reconsider the Bright Eyes records <em>Digital Ash in a Digital Urn</em> and <em>I'm Wide Awake It's Morning</em> (and maybe the rest of the oeuvre; I couldn't say). At the time of their release, I can't recall any friends saying anything even vaguely nice about these albums, with two exceptions: 1) Lindsay expressed delight at the phrase &quot;hoodie-clad trim&quot;, which I suppose doesn't really count, and b) Susan agreed with me that they were good and hey maybe all this NEXT DYLAN BUSINESS was maybe not so crazy, potentially? No: probably it was crazy! But pause for a moment and consider that, statistically speaking, Susan is almost certainly both smarter AND deadlier than you. Then reflect on whether you have given Conor Oberst a fair shake or whether you have discriminated against him just because he has <em>so many feelings</em>. Or because he was overhyped, or because his fanbase uses strange social networking sites that confuse and terrify you.Get past that. They're good albums, is what I'm trying to say, with timbre, cadence and emotional content similar to the Titus album. Worth a shot.</li>
<li>On Monday I listened, for the first time in at least half a decade, to the high points of the first big-hit Everclear LP. You know what? It holds up. This was not actually a surprise to me: I have been an apologist for <em>Sparkle &amp; Fade</em> and <em>So Much For the Afterglow</em> for years now (the other albums: emphatically not). What was surprising: this is an alt-country album! Sort of, anyway. The guitar work is a bit too clean, and there's nobody playing pedal steel while chain-smoking. But try listening to the phrasing of the songs on <em>S&amp;E</em> with the words &quot;Son Volt&quot; in your mind; I think you might be surprised. And anyway albums about heroin always tend to punch above their weight. Reconsider.</li>

                    <p>I hate being a NIMBY. The truth about city life is that it's crowded. Not unpleasantly so, not most of the time, but you're going to find yourself around a lot of your fellow men, and sometimes they'll get in your way and sometimes you'll get in theirs. It's your responsibility to try to hold your tongue in the case of the former and count on your obliviousness to the latter to even everything out. If everyone threw a fit about every inconvenience they had to suffer, none of us could enjoy the things that are great about living together.</p>
<p>But I think the disruptions accompanying the nuclear disarmament summit at the convention center go a bit beyond the normal give and take of city life. I hasten to add that I haven't suffered much personal inconvenience -- walking a few extra blocks on Sunday evening has been about the worst of it. My discomfort is more about how the event feels than what it's done to me, and maybe that means my objections should be ignored. But it's disturbing to see the streets barricaded, to feel suspicious eyes on you as you walk from the grocery story and past an idling Humvee. I don't like that the folks living in the apartments on the same block as the convention center are being physically searched before being allowed into their homes. I don't like that businesses in the area have had to shut down for the duration of the summit.</p>
<p>And it's hard for me to really see the case for hosting this event. DC has a lot of non-negotiable obligations to the federal government, many of them understandable. But the convention center? It's still a business, right? They could have said no, right? That they're sorry, but they can't handle the security requirements; that the economic boost that a convention is supposed to bring would, in this case, be swamped by the disruptions that would ripple across the city; that the city's facilities exist for its residents, and the proposal on the table asked them to make sacrifices without receiving comparable benefits.</p>
<p>Maybe they could have said this, but I think they probably didn't. And now a commuter has died <a class="reference external" href="http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/archives/2010/04/cyclist-killed-by-military-vehicle.php/comment-page-2#comment-1809745">what sounds like a truly horrific death</a> because of the decision to try to protect and accommodate the world's most important people in the middle of a working city.</p>
<p>I'm sorry to be upset by this, because I know this city is filled with suffering that I easily shrug off. It's stupid that I feel angry just because she and I got to work the same way.</p>
<p>But I am angry. Because people online are blaming the victim. Because the security equipment used to protect our leaders has continued to grow even as the threats they face have withered. Mostly because it could easily have been me, or someone I know.</p>
<p>I know it's the federal city. We will grit our teeth and mostly go along, thinking little of pausing for the daily motorcades down Connecticut, contenting ourselves with grumbling half-heartedly about a commuter tax from time to time.</p>
<p>But now that the planners' ever-escalating <em>24</em> fetishization has shown its deadly potential, it needs to be put in check. Military vehicles do not belong within city limits. I'm all for nuclear disarmament, but I hope federal officials take their next high-risk party to a more appropriate location. I intend to insist that city leaders do what they can to make that happen.</p>

<p>The AVR is a particular brand of microcontroller (&quot;uCs&quot; for short) -- the same one that powers the Arduino, in fact. I should maybe explain what that means. Microcontrollers aren't very useful by themselves. They need power supplies, things to interact with, and sometimes some supporting components to protect the relatively delicate chip. The Arduino platform adds a bunch of commonly-used circuitry around an AVR chip. It also provides a software environment -- both on the chip and on the computer you use to write code -- that's easier to work with than vanilla AVR code. With Arduino you don't have to worry about binary arithmetic or anything like that -- the metaphors in use are similar to the ones employed when programming a full-sized computer system. The software environment abstracts that stuff away. It makes for a much less daunting experience, particularly for those who have taken an introductory CS class.</p>
<p>As you might expect, Arduino has to make some sacrifices to achieve this ease of use. The AVR has some interesting features that aren't exposed, or aren't fully exposed, by the Arduino environment. Things like interrupts (a useful way to increase the responsiveness of your application and avoid messy loop structures), variable clock speeds (a good way to save power) and sleep modes (another good way to save power) are more easily worked with through direct manipulation of the AVR. Plus there's the fact that, for many applications, an Arduino is overkill. It's physically larger, it has circuitry for features you may not be using, and it costs $15 bucks or so, instead of as little as a dollar or two for an AVR.</p>
<p>The AVR/Arduino system is actually a great example of the power of abstraction: not only does Arduino make AVR development easier, but AVR taken by itself also represented something of a landmark in the simplification of microcontroller development. That's because you can write programs for the AVR in C, instead of the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.virtualdub.org/blog/pivot/entry.php?id=84">inscrutable assembly code</a> demanded by most other architectures (the PIC family of uC is also popular with hobbyists because it let them program in a flavor of BASIC -- but AVR is supplanting it).</p>
<p>Of course, to a scripting language-oriented CS fraud such as myself, programming in C is still daunting. I haven't really worked with compiled languages since college, and I certainly wasn't any good at them -- there's a <a class="reference external" href="/2010/01/29/the-stack/">threshold of understanding</a> that I didn't cross until years after graduation; I'm still years away from the sophistication on these matters that people like <a class="reference external" href="http://al3x.net">Alex</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://timothyblee.com">Tim</a> possess.</p>
<p>But even they would probably find AVR programming to be a bit bizarre. It mostly involves the manipulation of the specific bits located in specific places in memory. There are helpful macros for this stuff exposed by avr-libc, but figuring them out still involves trudging through <a class="reference external" href="http://www.atmel.com/atmel/acrobat/doc2467.pdf">novel-length PDFs</a>. And since there's obviously no monitor attached to the chip, debugging presents some unique challenges.</p>
<p>My advice to anyone starting down this path would be to find a class, like I did. Having someone who can supply you with a working Makefile counts for a hell of a lot.</p>

                    <p>If there's one flavor of reporting I find more irritating than innumerate science &quot;journalism&quot;, it's got to be the cybersecurity beat. <a class="reference external" href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=125598665">This morning NPR was the offender</a>.</p>
<p>I should admit up front that I automatically assume that anyone employing the prefix &quot;cyber&quot; is an idiot, and this unfortunately means that I'm inclined toward skepticism even when listening to actual experts in the field. But this NPR piece is symptomatic of a undeniably idiotic tendency to lump together every governmental system that takes electricity, then assume that summarizing the first twenty minutes of <em>Transformers</em> and asking &quot;WHAT IF?!&quot; qualifies you as some sort of digital Cassandra.</p>
<p>The piece starts out by discussing Russian vandals' successful efforts to screw with the Georgian government's website -- something that can be plausibly done by a disaffected teenager -- then jumps rapidly to &quot;monkey[ing] with GPS&quot; which involves, you know, <em>satellites</em>, or at least skill at building, concealing and fortifying radio transmitters; and, if anything other than a braindead denial of service, would also require the discovery of a novel attack on the system's design. These things are much harder than checking to see if the recently-launched website of a small ex-Soviet country is running slightly outdated software that someone else has written an exploit for.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Of course, the U.S. military is planning its own cyberattacks. Pentagon cyberwarriors have detailed plans to take down power, telecommunication and transportation systems just about anywhere.</p>
<p>There is just one problem: What if the other side strikes first? In cyberwar scenarios, pre-emptive attacks are favored, and effective retaliation can be difficult.</p>
<p>&quot;We have extremely good cyberoffensive capabilities and almost nothing in the way of cyberdefense,&quot; Clarke says.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?</em> Disrupting the operation of a website is very different from disrupting the operation of the internet, which is very different from interfering with military communication systems, which is very different from interfering with military <em>battlefield</em> communication systems, which is very different from being susceptible to the interception of digital communications. But all of these things are just jammed together, mindlessly.</p>
<p>What kinds of electronic attack are possible? To what extent are our defense systems susceptible to them -- in particular, are those systems at all tangled up with the internet? If not, what economic consequences could plausibly be inflicted on our country by disruption of the internet, and how do they compare to the historical example of, say, a blockade? If an online attack originates from overseas, what countermeasures are available? And do we have a protocol in place with the major backbone operators to implement them?</p>
<p>None of these questions are asked or answered. Blah blah blah cyber. That's it, over and over. This is a multi-part series, so perhaps future installments will resolve this problem. But so far NPR's approach is just to quote a bunch of people in the cyberwar pontification business making ominous intonations about our need to take cyberwar more seriously (i.e. spend more money on people like themselves).</p>
<p>Then there's this:</p>
<blockquote>
For a country whose economy operates largely in cyberspace and whose military pioneered Net-centric warfare, this is a serious failing.</blockquote>
<p>This author pretty clearly has no idea what Net-centric warfare is supposed to mean -- it's just used a nice lexical break from those relentless &quot;cyber&quot;s. Here, <a class="reference external" href="http://fpc.state.gov/documents/organization/33858.pdf">have a CRS report</a>. Yeesh.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>If you ask me, there are two excellent reasons for learning how to surf. When you're young, it seems to be a great way to achieve a lifestyle focused on taking drugs and having sex. And when you're older, the sport is a surefire wellspring for pretentious mystical ruminations, as memorably/disastrously demonstrated by <em>John From Cincinnati</em>*.</p>
<p>Well, I'm not young any more, but I'm also not yet good enough at surfing to bore you about it properly. Emily and I finished our Costa Rican vacation in <a class="reference external" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=dominical,+costa+rica&amp;sll=38.908292,-77.025269&amp;sspn=0.010035,0.017273&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Dominical,+Puntarenas,+Costa+Rica&amp;ll=9.698228,-84.04541&amp;spn=3.25376,4.421997&amp;z=8">Dominical</a>, a town only recently connected to the rest of the country by reliable highways, and still tucked behind an intimidatingly industrial plane of geometrically-arranged oil palms. It's everything you could want from a surf town: if there ever was an authentic local culture to feel liberal guilt about, it was washed away years ago by the slacker tide. Every restaurant is simultaneously a tourist trap and a locals' hangout. Every shop seems both dangerous and sleepy. Everyone is always at the beach; everyone is always hanging out; everyone is beautiful, tanned and weather-beaten. They all look like surfers, because they are.</p>
<p>We stayed a kilometer up the beach, at a place called <a class="reference external" href="http://www.rocaverde.net/">Roca Verde</a>, which has a reputation for hosting a particularly noteworthy and raucous disco every Saturday night. We missed it; for us, the place mostly made an impression as being comfortable, stocked with good food, and run by a scrupulously honest and helpful owner named Frank. He's the one whom we asked to book us a surf lesson -- this was the one thing I came to Costa Rica really wanting to do, and it was the reason we had come to Dominical. Frank left a bunch of voicemails for his preferred surf instructor, but never managed to connect with him. Finally, he reached out to a different guy, a local by the name of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.gatosurfcamp.com/">Jose Obando</a>. &quot;To be honest, this might be better for you,&quot; Frank said. &quot;Jose's probably the best surfer on the beach.&quot;</p>
<p>Well, I'm sure he says that to all the clueless tourists. But Jose was certainly an impressive surfer, and a very good teacher. Emily and I managed to each get up on our first try! The rest of the lesson went well, too -- well enough that I asked if we could take another lesson the following morning, before leaving town. I wanted to ride a real wave.</p>
<p>Jose said okay, so we met him the next day and drove to Dominicalito, a beach just up the road with smaller waves. As I said, our first lesson was on &quot;whitewater&quot; -- waves that had already broken -- and they weren't much to worry about. But further out the swells at Dominical's main beach are pretty big (the guidebooks insist: <em>don't surf while stoned</em>), so it made sense to head to a less ambitious location.</p>
<p>It was still pretty tough. The first day of surfing -- two hours of surfing, really -- had left us beaten up. Emily and I both got sunburns despite conscientiously-applied SPF 30. We'd picked up some nasty board rash, too -- proper technique involves a lot of time spent arching your back and placing your torso's weight on the bottom of your ribcage. For me, this translated into a bruised rib (exacerbated by my stupid tendency to flop onto my board like a wet sack of meat), which is still a minor nuisance three weeks later. And besides the injuries, surfing is <em>hard work</em>, particularly when you don't know what you're doing and are therefore not doing it gracefully, and even more so when you're responsible for managing an incredibly large (though incredibly stable!) surfboard.</p>
<p>By the hour mark of our second lesson Emily and I had both successfully caught several waves, albeit with helpful launching pushes from Jose. But my ass was dragging. Getting back beyond the break was a chore. Waves crashed over me, pushing me back, forcing me to roll with my board, only to be caught by the next wave, wasting energy, slowing down. My ribs burned whenever I lifted my head off the board, preventing me from paddling efficiently to where I needed to go. I still had a helpfully buoyant surfboard attached to me with an ankle leash, in water only slightly over my head. But I was swimming in the ocean, clearly near exhaustion, and there were moments when it started to get a little frightening.</p>
<p>We called it a day a few minutes shy of our lesson's planned two hours. Our board rashes had begun to produce spots of blood; worse, the backs of Emily's legs had been completely devastated by the sun -- her reward for staying on the board and paddling like she was supposed to. I'm glad to have done the second lesson, and I want to do more. But I left it utterly beaten up and exhausted.</p>
<p>So you should dismiss the pretensions to surfing lyricism that you're about to catch me spouting. My intermittently-ecstatic surfing experience was punctuated by a lot of exhaustion, pain and gulps of seawater. But I can definitely see why the surfer-cowboy-poets like it. The way Jose could pick developing waves out of the mass of water beyond the break; or point out riptides by sight; or know when to paddle hard to steal the wave's energy; all that stuff mystifies and fascinates me. It's somewhere between tracking a deer and doing a Fourier transform, and I sort of doubt it can be taught except by making someone's unconscious neural machinery stare at an undulating plane of water for hours on end, bobbing contentedly and not thinking of much of anything at all.&nbsp; And that sounds alright to me, too.</p>
<p>So yes, surfing. I think this could be a pretty good sport for an old guy.</p>

                    <p>This will interest nobody, but I need to complain (and perhaps spare others some fruitless googling): the iPhone version of Safari seems to be broken when using AJAX in offline caching in HTML5 applications.</p>
<p>&quot;Why would you want to use AJAX in an offline app?&quot; you ask, and it's a good question. Well, I'm trying to make an HTML5 interface to the <a class="reference external" href="http://sunlightlabs.com/blog/2010/our-door-opener-science-project/">office door-opening thingy</a>, because the native iPhone version, being a non-App Store offering, will be expiring soon in an irritating way (insert entirely different anti-Apple rant here).</p>
<p>Users will, of course, need network access to open the door. But I don't see any particular reason to make users download the 300-some-K of assets necessary to make a proper <a class="reference external" href="http://www.jqtouch.com/">jQTouch</a> iPhone app work every time they need to get into the office (or change their settings) -- particularly since I'm using a little onSuccess wav file (just for fun). So I set about using some offline caching to keep all that material decidedly on the iPhone, and not subject to the whims of Safari's caching policy.</p>
<p>This works fine until it's time to issue the request to open the door. The cache manifest file, which allows you to specify which items will be stored offline, allows for a whitelisted &quot;NETWORK&quot; section that will never be subject to the cache. Typically, you add your AJAX endpoint(s) to that section. Except in this case that AJAX request is made to a different domain than the one where the application lives (and when the application is being served from an offline cache who knows where it *thinks* it lives?), utilizing the now years-old-but-still-awfully-clever <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP">JSONP</a> to escape the same-domain restrictions of a vanilla AJAX request.</p>
<p>This all works fine, <a class="reference external" href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1911614/how-do-i-avoid-having-jsonp-returns-cached-in-an-html5-offline-application/2572077">according to other people</a>. But not for me. My application's endpoint uses SSL in order to protect users' door-opening credentials, and that seems to make the difference. It just. doesn't. work. If you change the cache manifest, prompting the app to be reloaded, everything will work fine. Once. When you reload the app, pulling from the offline cache, the AJAX request produces a momentary activity indicator in the status bar, but there's no response. (No error, either! Thanks a bunch, Apple and/or jQuery.)</p>
<p>I've tried <a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/p/jqtouch/issues/detail?id=179">updating jQuery</a>. I've tried whitelisting &quot;*&quot;. I've tried whitelisting the http version of the endpoint, and just the path portion of the endpoint, and the full domain name of the endpoint (SSL and not). No dice.</p>
<p>Here's the relevant code, for anyone feeling particularly curious/masochistic. I've tried a lot of variations on it -- at this point I'm pretty sure that this aspect of iPhone Safari circa OS 3.1.2* is just broken. Ah well. No caching isn't the end of the world, but it is kind of annoying.</p>

                    <p>Oh right: back from Georgia, only sort of jetlagged, back up to speed shortly. It was great! But let me share one useful lesson learned on my trip: guys, when flying, wear a jacket.</p>
<p>I wore a jacket on my way out; on my way back, I opted for a frumpier but more practical fleece. The difference in how I was treated by the airline staff was astounding. No <a class="reference external" href="/2010/03/24/they-call-it-wien-which-i-am-still-immature-enough-to-find-hilarious/">offered upgrades to business class</a> on the trip back; in fact, they wouldn't even let me hang up my garment bag -- not because there wasn't space, but because I was flying coach. This was not a problem on the way out.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I'm not going to back down from the idea that wearing dress shoes for 36 hours of travel is a terrible idea. &quot;Hip but important internet guy&quot;: I think that's the sweet spot I want.</p>

                    <p>And I was thinking that I wasn't going to emerge thrilled about the book, but once through the (necessary) parts about Oscar's mom it gets pretty great. How can you not want to be Yunior's friend? (er, at the point in the story where I am, I should say. Maybe something terrible happens. Well, okay, obviously something terrible is going to happen; maybe Yunior's complicit, I mean).</p>
<p>I have no other media recommendations to make, other than to note that Russian sitcoms dubbed into Georgian don't seem as funny to me as they do to the guys in the bar downstairs. Or it may be that it's all about sophisticated wordplay; hard to say.</p>

                    <p>Tbilisi continues to be great, and I'm really pleased by the amount of useful work that I'm getting done with the TI folks -- we've gotten up to speed very quickly. Turns out that being a technologist at a transparency-oriented nonprofit in Georgia is pretty similar to being a technologist at a transparency-oriented nonprofit in America, except that if you were going to find an author for the novelization you'd want someone closer to John le Carre than Joseph Heller.</p>
<p>I'm staying at Betsy's Hotel, which seems to be a kind of hub for the expat community. It's a very nice place, and even has programmer-friendly amenities like the one you see below:</p>

<p>Zero-indexed floors! C'mon, you can't find that kind of accommodation in the states. Admittedly you have to worry about an out-of-range exception whenever you head to the dining room in the basement, but so far nothing bad has come of it.</p>

                    <p>Aside from some dude spilling tomato juice all over me, my next flight was uneventful. I got into town at 6 this morning, slept for two hours, then put in a full day at the TI Georgia offices. To say I'm going to sleep soundly wouldn't even begin to describe what's about to happen. Past jetlag-sleep episodes have featured slumber so sound that kindly old ladies held mirrors under my nose to check if I was still breathing. But that was after only half as much travel as this time.</p>
<p>But before I hit the sack, here's a video of my extremely comfortable accommodations, and of the broadcasting tower at the top of the hill above me. Driving into Tblisi was fun -- not just because of the high speed employed by my driver, but because of the way the city is lit. Grandiose architecture is lit with sometimes-garish accent lighting, and the effect is really pretty striking. It's near-Eastern Soviet decay under a layer of New Orleans' sinister pageantry -- that's the closest I can come to describing it, anyway. I actually really like it.</p>
<p>The tower in this video doesn't mesh with the color palette or static nature of most of the lighting, but it does seem to have sprung from the same mindset that launched the overall illumination program, which I'm told is only a few years old. The tower was the first thing I could see through the fog from my airplane window, and if it isn't visible from space I'm sure the administration will soon tear it down and build one that is.</p>

It's not that anything's been a surprise, exactly (in fact, everything has gone almost miraculously well: I've caught every train, made every flight and even took the exact right number of euros out of the ATM for my layover). I wasn't mentally prepared, but I <em>knew</em> I wasn't prepared. It's been something like eight years since I spent a night in Stansted. I'm pretty sure that's the only trip during which I've spent more time in airports.</p>
<p>For what it's worth, the Vienna airport isn't bad. They seemingly want to stamp your passport every time you head to the bathroom, but otherwise I have no major complaints. Free wifi, an okay number of power outlets, and the above-average number of screaming children are offset by relatively humane bathrooms. Protip: the chairs between A and C terminals are your sweet spot for internet access and charging capability.</p>
<p>But this isn't to say that the trip has been sunlight and roses. Tbilisi is not exactly easy to get to, and this weekend, neither is Vienna. I'm told that some storms backed things up, and my flight was overbooked. They offered me business class to add an initial leg to Frankfurt, but I balked: Frankfurt is the only airport I've been through that insists on swabbing your laptop for explosive residue when you're merely trying to get to a connecting flight to the US or a Schengen country. They're nuts over there -- driven mad, perhaps, by the vast empty expanses of their concourse -- and I didn't want to put my connection to Tbilisi at risk: I suspected that if I missed it I'd be losing a full day. Besides, I was sort of looking forward to sightseeing during my layover in Vienna.</p>
<p>Two people at the gate changed my mind. First, the agent, who offered me cash instead of an upgrade. I was still wishy-washy and worried, though, until a grizzled Russian executive, who was lined up at the desk to arrange for a ride in the jump seat to an eye surgery appointment and seemed to be straight out of a Bond movie casting office's &quot;rejected: drunk&quot; pile, emphysematically gurgled assurances to me that the Vienna/Tbilisi transfer was a piece of cake. &quot;It's no problem,&quot; he said, occasionally clutching his throat, &quot;I've done it many times. Besides, you're on the manifest, your bags are checked through. They have to wait for you.&quot; That seemed convincing enough, so I took the deal and started wondering whether the Frankfurt airport had a casino suitable for blowing $400 of Austrian Airways' money.</p>
<p>As it turns out, the gate agent was confused, or he confused me, or I'm just bad at this. My time in Frankfurt was short -- as always, their crazed security almost made me miss my connection -- but I found myself in Vienna pretty much in line with my original schedule, and with much of the day to kill before my flight. By this point I was delirious with fatigue, so I performed the world's slowest toothbrushing, sat on a bench for a while, and eventually figured out how to pick up my voucher, check my garment bag and board the CAT train into the city.</p>
<p>From there I hopped on the U3 to the Stephansplatz -- an efficient but boringly off-the-shelf European subway line and central square, respectively -- then wandered around until I found a cafe that looked bearably non-touristy, but which still had wifi and some English on the menus. Cafe Mozart served me some overpriced but tasty <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tafelspitz">tafelspitz</a>, then I headed around the corner to the Hotel Sacher and had some <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachertorte">Sachertorte</a> (a damning IFA post is forthcoming) before strolling through the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.aboutvienna.org/parks/burggarten.php">Burggarten</a>, then doing my trip from the airport in reverse.</p>
<p>I'm now sitting at Terminal A's Cafe Johann Strauss (as you might have already inferred form the name, it's not as good as the other one), drinking a pleasantly metric-sized beer, and reveling in the suddenly-working-again wifi. My flight's been pushed back an hour, to 10:25, and if everything goes according to plan I should be getting into Tbilisi around 5 or 6 AM. At this point catnaps actually seem to be doing something, and I'm further from collapse than I might have expected. I am really, really, really looking forward to being in a hotel room, though. The vagaries of wifi access and waterproofing mean that I may not be able to liveblog the shower I'm going to take when I get there, but my suspicion is that it's going to be GREAT.</p>

<p>I'm supposed to spend 12 hours in Vienna along the way, so if anyone has any particularly good ideas about how to utilize a brief Austrian lunchtime interlude, please let me know.&nbsp; I half-suspect those hours will be used up on tortuous sleep in the airport: normally I would be feeling good about my prospects for rest during the flight, having just bought the CVS generic antihistamine with the most severe-sounding warning about operating heavy machinery that I could find.&nbsp; But I came down with a cold this weekend, and am several years older than the last time I dealt with serious jetlag, and generally suspect that waking up early could kill me.</p>
<p>Despite this, it should be fun!&nbsp; I'm looking forward to seeing Georgia, a country that's possessed an incredible mystique for me ever since I read Susan's writing about it (more recent reports from my colleague Ryan have done nothing to diminish the myth).&nbsp; It's a little strange to be leaving the office so soon after getting back from Costa Rica, but I think the trip is going to be worth the disruption.</p>
<p>And yes, I haven't yet written up any of the additional Costa Rica blog posts I intend to write.&nbsp; I still intend to write them!&nbsp; Who knows, hotel-bound paralysis born of pathetic language skills just might make it happen...</p>

                    <p>Oh! Hello there! I'm not in Costa Rica any more, it turns out.&nbsp; Actually, I've been back since Saturday evening, but I've been too busy growing an entirely new layer of skin to write anything here.&nbsp; That process is now wrapping up, which leaves just the photo editing and fighting with Picasa-to-Flickr uploading (but then it turned out to be a network proxy problem) and then realizing that my <a class="reference external" href="/2006/10/26/fun-with-lightbox-and-booze/">Flickr/Lightbox gallery script</a> didn't make it past the move to Wordpress, and considering writing a WP plugin to fix it but then deciding to try out a half dozen until I finally found <a class="reference external" href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/flickr-tag/installation/">this one</a> which does what I want. Whew.</p>
<p>What? Right, Central America.&nbsp; Emily and I just spent 7 days in Costa Rica, driving through mountains, clouds and grids of oil palms, attempting the full volcano/cloud forest/beach trifecta.&nbsp; I want to write about each of those things, but for now you'll have to be satisfied with some pictures.</p>

                    <p>A few weeks back Emily and I were out at Bob &amp; Barbara's having some drinks with our friends Sarah, John Carlos and Tara. We got to talking about art and technology and sculpture, and with the help of my phone John Carlos found a video of some work he'd done.&nbsp; The bar wasn't the best place for watching it, so I emailed it to myself and forgot about it until just now:</p>

<p>The look is just as bespoke, concentrated and confusing as his description had implied, and the noise it makes every bit as terrible as Tara had promised.&nbsp; I think it's great.</p>

<p>Charles and I have been watching the Olympics avidly, as it's provided a welcome and unexpected outlet for the violent anti-Canadian sentiment that we hadn't even realized was building up inside us, poisoning our hearts and minds. <em>They think they're so great. Or at least, they think they're okay, but will resolve to try harder.</em> Those bastards.</p>
<p>The Olympics come with various apocryphal stories, most having to do with athletes overcoming personal adversity.&nbsp; But Charles also heard a good one about the South Korean speed skating team's training regimen.&nbsp; Supposedly they're in the habit of doing interval training where they sprint for 40 seconds, then walk for 20, then repeat the cycle seven more times.&nbsp; Charles said he'd tried it and it was a surprisingly exhausting way to spend 8 minutes.</p>
<p>I can back that up.&nbsp; When I was done with my first attempt, I could swear I tasted blood.&nbsp; I kept walking around the track for what seemed like forever, afraid to let my heart rate drop to the level it desperately wanted to.&nbsp; Eventually I was fine, though I felt like I had completely exfoliated the inside of my lungs.&nbsp; <em>Man</em>, was it exhausting.&nbsp; And I was cheating, using 30 second rests!</p>
<p>Perhaps your cardiovascular system is not as pathetic as my own (I hope not; these lungs have proven to be serious underperformers).&nbsp; Either way, this is worth a try.&nbsp; And as a bonus, it produces an unusually bumpy and cool-looking heart rate graph, captured courtesy of the neat Garmin monitoring doohickey that Emily bought for me a year ago (that first peak is from me climbing up the six floors to the YMCA's indoor track).</p>

                    <p>(Spoilers ahead)</p>
<p>Emily and I saw it on Valentine's Day, and although its lack of sexy vampires meant it was starting at a disadvantage vis a vis other werewolf movies, it was still fairly good.&nbsp; In fact, for the first third of the movie it was just about everything you could want from a werewolf movie.&nbsp; The moors were misty, the townspeople were appropriately panicky, and the beast -- unspoken, unseen -- was terrifying.</p>
<p>Anthony Hopkins is especially good -- stacked up against a bunch of lesser and/or less professionally diligent actors, it becomes immediately apparent just how real a quality charisma is.&nbsp; He does a great job as the obvious Colonel Kurtz figure, telegraphing the coming action to the audience in a dread-inducing way while keeping his character's status close enough to ambiguity that the rest of the cast's &quot;oh I think maybe he's just depressed&quot; treatment of him remains plausible.&nbsp; Hell, for the first act even Benicio del Toro seems okay, if you allow yourself to succumb to the tempting fantasy that his puffy, waxy aristocrat is being played that way to better contrast with his coming bestial descent. Actually, though, it turns out he's just a bad actor!&nbsp; Or doesn't give a shit.&nbsp; Either way.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, things degrade once the filmmakers let the werewolves out of Scotland.&nbsp; The Victorian London on display is even less imaginative than the one from <em>The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen</em>.&nbsp; And, <a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/al3x/status/9082789161">as al3x points out</a>, a proper werewolf demands a snout.&nbsp; I get that they were intentionally sticking with the classic wolfman look, but it really needed more of an update from that &quot;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.cinemaretro.com/uploads/wolfman2.jpg">I would have combed my hair if I knew I was going to be photographed</a>&quot; look.</p>
<p>The movies does nothing with the tension-creating dynamics of the rules surrounding werewolf transformations.&nbsp; The feints toward the destroying-someone-you-love theme that's essential to werewolf stories seem half-hearted. The first act culminates in a fantastic scene at a gypsy camp, but everything else involving the gypsies turns out to be a red herring.&nbsp; In fact, everything after that scene is either completely banal and straightforward, or a half-assed fakeout that does nothing but waste your time and attention.&nbsp; And Hugo Weaving continues to annoy and disappoint me whenever he's not playing a computer.</p>
<p>But man, what could've been! Really, the first third is very well done, and well worth sitting through when it arrives on HBO.&nbsp; Hopefully by then you'll be able to stream <em>Dog Soldiers</em> off Netflix, and you can turn off the later parts of <em>Wolfman</em> in favor of that.</p>

<li>It's interesting to watch how people are using the service, and to try to deduce the norms that will soon emerge arround it.&nbsp; I just de-linked my Flickr account because I realized I didn't mean to push a recently-uploaded photo on my followers.&nbsp; I still have Twitter linked to it -- though given the FB status/Twitter faux pas, I suspect I'll remove that connection soon, too.</li>
<li>The automatic importation of contacts strikes me as a big mistake.&nbsp; Not only because it's a privacy problem, but because it short-circuits <a class="reference external" href="/2009/07/02/after-twitter/">the normal lifecycle of social networks</a>. It's a profoundly elitist opinion, but I do think that it's important to have an initial phase during which early-adopting users fill a new service with high-value content -- amusing, uncensored, nonprofessional/noncommercial communication -- creating a attractive networking target for the rest of the population, which then filters in.Instead, Google has&nbsp; opted to drop its users into the midpoint of its new network's lifecycle.&nbsp; I'm not sure this is a bad idea, exactly -- I'd love to have a network with the immediacy of Twitter, but (slightly) looser space and media limitations (I'll be curious to see whether Google has built the infrastructure behind Buzz to make more Twitter-like use cases possible). In theory, Buzz can satisfy that desire: it's basically FriendFeed, but with a very high adoption rate among my contacts thanks to Google's marketing advantage.&nbsp; But because it skipped the (ahem) buzz-building phase, Buzz will never garner the excitement and accompanying celebrity and media evangelism that Twitter has.</li>
<li>Similarly, I doubt I'll adopt an evangelical stance toward the service among my peers -- I don't do that very often, don't have much of a talent for it, and don't want to spend personal capital pushing a new social network (which, these days, is always a low-percentage play).&nbsp; But I'll keep watching, and I'll keep using Buzz if other people do.</li>

And yes, I'm kind of sick of reading, and okay, I ate sardine tacos for lunch, and no, I have no idea what I would do if my power went out (but it's okay because THAT WILL NEVER HAPPEN).</p>
<p>But I still love the snow.&nbsp; It reminds me of that one big storm during my childhood, when a layer of snow was packed down to icy horribleness, then another foot was deposited on top, then a eighth-inch crust of freezing crust topped things off.&nbsp; That certainly gave the plows problems -- I got the whole week off school.&nbsp; Almost as good, it was just strong enough to support my form, when that form was properly enveloped in a puffy coat and on its stomach and sliding down the sleepy-streets-turned-gentle-hills of the neighborhood between my house and my friend Rob's.&nbsp; If you timed it, this turned out to not be such an efficient means of locomotion.&nbsp; At the time, though, it was the fastest, most thrilling way I'd ever moved across that space.</p>
<p>This storm seems likely to involve a bit less ecstatic ad-hoc sledding and a bit more disgusting slush and missing Taylor sandwich ingredients.&nbsp; Childhood in the suburbs has a commanding lead over adulthood in the city when it comes to winter wonderment.&nbsp; But I'm still thrilled to see icicles on my neighbors' gutters, and drifts accumulating in the corners of the alley below. C'mon, guys: <em>snow day</em>. Those words are going to thrill me until the day I die.</p>

                    <p>A couple of weeks ago, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/?p=826">Bunnie Huang wrote this in response to a piece on NPR</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here’s [the part of the NPR story that] I found particularly poignant:</p>
<blockquote>
Two centuries ago, our forebears would have known the precise history and source of almost every one of the limited number of things they ate and owned. They would have been familiar with the pig, the carpenter, the weaver, the loom and the dairymaid. The range of items available for purchase may have grown exponentially since then, but our understanding of their genesis has grown ever more obscure. We are now as imaginatively disconnected from the production and distribution of our goods as we are practically in reach of them, a process of alienation which has stripped us of opportunities for wonder, gratitude and guilt.</blockquote>
<p>That last sentence, I think, resonates strongly with my personal motivation as a Maker. I dive deeply into the supply chain, learning the processes and understanding the people behind our Things, because it enables me to once again feel the wonder, gratitude, and guilt for the Things we otherwise take for granted. Wonder at the skill of craftsmen and the cleverness of designers; gratitude for the passion and hard work of my peers; and guilt for the sacrifice, waste, and unsustainable practices motivated by an obscure system of perverse economic incentives.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I was a kid, I fell in love with computers.&nbsp; The world was incomprehensibly vast and terrifying, but here was a sort of bounded system, created by and therefore obviously understandable by humans, yet still mysterious enough to fascinate.&nbsp; It was the closest thing to magic that I knew of that I also knew I could master.</p>
<p>So, without even realizing what I was doing, I started to try to learn about computers.&nbsp; I messed around with AppleSoft BASIC; I set up BBS software; I figured out how to get a dual-modem setup working for 3-person games of Doom; I snipped the keyboard lock wire on my parents' 386 so that they couldn't keep me off of the thing during summer break while they were away at work.</p>
<p>Along the way I began to understand bits and pieces of these systems.&nbsp; More importantly, I began to understand the larger aesthetic that unified them.&nbsp; It's a cliche that kids are better at technology than adults -- the joke's now about programming Tivo instead of programming the VCR, but it persists because it's true.&nbsp; I think that's mostly because kids come to new interfaces with fewer preconceptions about how they ought to work, and with more patience because their time is worth less (I've certainly found myself getting worse at learning new interfaces as I've gotten older and (even) less patient).</p>
<p>But I was <em>really</em> good with technology, not just kid-good, and I think it's because I had immersed myself in so much of it.&nbsp; The thing you have to understand about bad interface design is that it's not a product of stupidity: it's a product of engineering.&nbsp; There's a reason that your childhood TV's power button made a bigger click than its channel button did.&nbsp; There's a reason that the channel button only became a button after it was a dial!&nbsp; At that age, I couldn't explain those reasons.&nbsp; But I could sense their existence, and became able to make inferences based upon them.</p>
<p>This isn't a project that I've completed, and certainly not one that I've abandoned.&nbsp; People sometimes refer to &quot;stacks&quot; of technologies that work in complementary ways -- the PHP scripting language runs on the Apache webserver, which runs on a machine using the Linux operating system that also has a MySQL database installed, and together they form the so-called LAMP stack that serves a lot of the web's content.</p>
<p>What the above quote is talking about is what I think of as the stack: the system of abstractions and physical mechanisms that makes digital computing possible.&nbsp; There is <em>so much of it</em>.&nbsp; It's a good thing, too, because as you chase down an explanation for one mysterious part, the fascination associated with it recedes.&nbsp; There was a time when I didn't know how web pages worked, and was thrilled to learn HTML.&nbsp; Now, frankly, I don't give a shit.&nbsp; But I <em>am</em> interested in how HTML is interpreted by Mozilla's layout engine. And how operating systems work. And how those operating systems abstract away the varyingly serial and parallel nature of processors.&nbsp; And how silicon doping and photolithography produce those processors (and why ever-higher wavelengths frequencies of light are needed for that -- and what limits there are on this technique). Or how sound is stored on a hard drive. And what makes a keyboard's keys rebound, and how USB keyboards are different from PS/2 keyboards. And how copper is mined, and how we create a voltage across huge stretches of it.&nbsp; And what a voltage is! And why my LCD monitor needs to create such a large voltage to produce light, and how that light is encoded by my retina.&nbsp; And the way that an HTTP request becomes TCP packets which become ethernet frames, and then how that's all reversed on the other side.</p>
<p>I can give pretty good answers to a few of these questions, perform tolerable hand-waving for others, and am totally at sea for some.&nbsp; As you might've noticed from my list, I've become less and less interested in what's happening within software's incredibly vast tangle of abstractions as I've gotten older -- the abstraction itself eventually becomes a predictable pattern, and therefore a bit boring.&nbsp; These days it takes a relatively extreme case of novelty to get me excited about software (typically something that will be completely inscrutable to non-geeks who don't share my now-quite-perverse taste).</p>
<p>And of course there's always more. Really, the computer was a conceptual frame and gateway through which I could start considering every piece of technology, bit by bit.&nbsp; It's a little more than a hobby and considerably less than a religion, but pondering the stack is important to me.</p>
<p>It's not for everybody, though.&nbsp; <a class="reference external" href="http://www.rinich.com/post/358597818/i-love-walled-gardens">Here's an example</a>!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some of the biggest complaints [about the iPad] come from programmers that say the closed system means people won’t be able to satisfy their computer curiosities. To which I again say: Good! Then they’ll have to satisfy their curiosities about emotional maturity and social interaction and possibly even thinking about making the world a better place.</p>
<p>It is not productive to spend an hour learning how to change the font on your computer’s clock. Even if while you’re doing that you’re learning about how computers work, you’re wasting your time and getting somewhere trivial very slowly. It reminds me of those copies of Shakespeare schools give children with all the annotations defining words and metaphors and techniques, so that kids can appreciate Shakespeare. It doesn’t work. It just makes Shakespeare look like a cryptogram that you can’t read like you do a normal play. Opening up a system that wasn’t meant to be opened just makes little kids cry.</p>
<p>The standard response, when I sink so low as to let programmers communicate with me, is: “But Rory, programming is my passion. I was willing to spend that long learning how to code.” No, I think back at them — programmers are not given the satisfaction of hearing my voice. No, you were willing to spend that long because you had obsessive-compulsive problems mixed with an antisocial attitude.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>This system is closed! No tinkering! You can browse the Internet, or check your mail, or take notes, or listen to music, but when you’re out of little buttons to press then you’re out of things to do. Discover something else. You are not allowed to delve into the things that nobody ought to care about. You’re forced to get another button, or to put down your pad and make out with the other people wandering, dazed, unsure of what to do.</p>
<p>But however will children learn how to program? Simple: We will make them applications that teach them how to program. Every kid wants to make video games and Google, so it’s not like having a closed system will make them forget that such things are possible. When they go to learn, however, they will not learn by wasting their time doing things that will never make them happy in life. Instead, they will go to the carefully-screened App Store, and they will search for “How do I make video games”, and they will find a little button that teaches them and gives them a run-time environment in which to tinker. And because the iPad is so elegant and makes elegance so relatively easy, these apps will be elegant. We won’t get a row of advanced text editors too complex for people to understand. We will have a lot of simple, easy things that show us how joyful it is to tinker around, and that reveal their complexity and power as we learn enough to work at that level. I might even try my hand at something like that myself.</p>

<p>There is something to this!&nbsp; And yet, it's just <em>wrong</em> about how to teach programming.&nbsp; Programs that teach programming are stupid -- they're for tourists.&nbsp; The motivating impulse is noble, and I'd use one to give a class of students an idea of how computers work, but the talented engineers that emerge from that class will abandon such toys as soon as they can.</p>
<p>This is how people like <a class="reference external" href="http://al3x.net/2010/01/28/ipad.html">Alex</a> and myself learned to do the things we can do.&nbsp; Like anyone else, we like some things about ourselves, and we don't like things that we perceive as threats to the cultural dynamics that made us the way we are.</p>
<p>And I think this is why we don't like the idea of the iPad.&nbsp; More abstraction is good for users and bad for budding engineers.&nbsp; A kid today will learn much less about engineering from an HDTV's on screen menu than he would from my grandparents' chunky black &amp; white set.&nbsp; There's just more complexity to sort through, and replacing those raw objects d'engineering with stupid toys that represent what some engineer <em>thinks</em> is important about engineering -- well, I'm not sure there's a better alternative, but really it's just adding another layer of abstraction, one that will inevitably have to be peeled back.&nbsp; The entry point to the stack is getting <a class="reference external" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/matthewyglesias/~3/i0sJv8S8apQ/the-end-of-hierarchical-file-systems.php">further and further away from its bottom</a>; the task ahead of those kids is getting harder and harder.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we're not all going to be issued iPads.&nbsp; The personal computer will continue to exist.&nbsp; It's still quite modular, projects like Linux are still going strong, and the geeks of tomorrow will still be able to get a foothold as they begin to figure out how the world works.&nbsp; But hopefully this explains why things like the iPad are galling to people like me.&nbsp; My objections aren't really technical; they're cultural.</p>

                    <p>One thing you have to say for the iPad: it sits right in the middle of three classic consumer hardware debates: fat/thin client; walled garden/libre; and information appliance/general purpose device.&nbsp; I have no idea whether this position makes it a better device, but it sure does generate a lot of passionate (though fundamentally boring-and-cliched-as-hell) blog posts.</p>
<p>The libre/walled garden is the only one I find even remotely interesting, and that only because of the cultural considerations it embodies -- see <a class="reference external" href="http://al3x.net/2010/01/28/ipad.html">this post</a> from Alex Payne for more on that.&nbsp; <a class="reference external" href="http://io9.com/5458822/why-the-ipad-is-crap-futurism">Those making the assumption that the iPad represents some unitary future for computing</a>* are being quite silly, I think -- that's not going to happen.&nbsp; But it's worth reading Alex's post to understand <em>why</em> that admittedly-unlikely event would be <a class="reference external" href="http://mill-industries.com/post/341-breaking-curfew">a terrible thing for people like him and me</a>.</p>
<p>* Incidentally: any time you read something that approvingly quotes an expert whose listed credential is &quot;futurist&quot;, you should immediately dismiss it outright, and possibly also phone in a bomb threat to the publishing organization.&nbsp; Also: SixthSense is a neat tech demo, but assuming it works as well as the video is an astounding act of credulousness.&nbsp; Besides, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.google.com/search?q=snow%20crash%20gargoyle">no one wants to look that dumb in public</a>.</p>

                    <p>I didn't watch the iPad announcement. Having read <a class="reference external" href="http://createdigitalmusic.com/2010/01/27/how-a-great-product-can-be-bad-news-apple-ipad-and-the-closed-mac/">this</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://timothyblee.com/?p=2169">this</a> -- which I think you should read, too! -- it sounds like it was incredibly disappointing.&nbsp; Between my laptop, netbook and iPhone, the thing that I wish I could do but can't is read digital content while I'm sitting outside in the sun.&nbsp; To me the only thing that's interesting about this device is the <a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/choitotheworld/status/8288754455">psychotic</a> level of interest in its announcement that was on display, even by people from whom I wouldn't normally expect it.&nbsp; I'm increasingly convinced that the enthusiasms that make up geek culture (to the extent that such a thing exists) are part of a larger, communicable pathology that an ever-growing segment of the population is becoming susceptible to -- and not just because it's fashionable.</p>
<p>Anyway! Of today's tech news, I thought that the <a class="reference external" href="http://rdist.root.org/2010/01/27/how-the-ps3-hypervisor-was-hacked/">PS3's hypervisor getting cracked</a> was much more interesting than the iPad.&nbsp; Not really in an applied way -- you can already boot Linux on the thing (props to Sony for that), so you've gotta suspect that piracy is the primary aim of these efforts, which is a bit boring (especially since I don't plan to buy a PS3). But the technical details are just <em>neat</em>.&nbsp; The linked account gives a good rundown, but maybe I can explain <em>why</em> they're neat.</p>
<p>In the case of the PS1, Xbox and Xbox360, circumventi0n* techniques were clever but essentially reflective of failures of security design. By contrast, the engineering of the PS3's protection still looks logically bulletproof.&nbsp; The approach used by geohotz -- who also has done good work opening the iPhone, incidentally -- was to introduce a bunch of very tiny brown-outs into the system, screwing up the progress of the security-related things that it finds itself doing from time to time.&nbsp; There's more to it than that, of course: he needed to use what access to the system he <em>was</em> allowed to establish conditions such that when something went wrong, it was likely to go wrong in a way that was advantageous to him.&nbsp; As you might imagine, this is a considerably trickier thing than just pulling the plug until the power LED is half-faded (though using an FPGA sounds like overkill to me).</p>
<p>But still!&nbsp; More than the specific technical prowess involved, this speaks to the incredible difficulty of securing a system over which you can't assert physical control (especially if that system runs too hot to just encase its vulnerable parts in a blob of epoxy).&nbsp; In that respect it's kind of like <a class="reference external" href="http://freedom-to-tinker.com/blog/felten/new-research-result-cold-boot-attacks-disk-encryption">freezing RAM to make it preserve its contents long enough to extract them</a> (something done at the program <a class="reference external" href="http://www.timothyblee.com">Tim</a>'s attending, I should note).</p>
<p>* This is a completely providential typo. I have no idea how it happened, but I'm sure as hell not fixing it.</p>

                    <p>I asked this on Twitter last night, then quickly backed off, deferring to smarter friends to explain their outrage over the spending freeze that the President is proposing. I mean, in general I get it: we're liberals, we believe the government needs to expand in various ways, and we'd like to have some freedom to spend on our policy priorities while we're in power. It seems stupid for the president to tie his hands behind his back without even extracting concessions for doing so.</p>
<p>But then I think about the actual agenda: I'd put HCR, addressing climate change and dismantling the terrorball apparatus at the top of my list, as, I think, would most progressives. A spending freeze doesn't really preclude any of them*. In fact, all of them are potential deficit reducers!</p>
<p>Plus this, <a class="reference external" href="http://motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2010/01/little-night-music">via Kevin Drum</a>, just seems entirely wrong:</p>
<blockquote>
conservative Rich Lowry shows via Twitter that he understands why, even if the White House doesn't: &quot;spending freeze, no matter how notional, is a huge ceding of rhetorical grnd by WH. will give GOP more leverage in makng anti-hcr, stim case.&quot;</blockquote>
<p>You say &quot;ceding&quot;, I say &quot;co-opting&quot;. Reading <a class="reference external" href="http://washingtonindependent.com/74687/tea-partiers-and-freedomworks-craft-a-2010-agenda">Dave's piece from yesterday</a>, I was left with the impression that the alliance between establishment conservatives and the tea partiers -- the only actually vibrant part of the right at the moment -- is tenuous at best (&quot;...and starring Newt Gingrich as Ahmed Chalabi!&quot;). Maybe I'm being naive, but it seems to me like signaling a commitment to the teabaggers' (admittedly incoherent) concerns about fiscal responsibility could do a lot to confuse that burgeoning relationship. If it can be done without seriously endangering social welfare entitlements; without affecting the party's main policy initiatives; and hey, maybe even with it as cover for going after a few things like <a class="reference external" href="http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/archives/2010/01/obama-budget-to-call-for-freeze-in-non-security-discretionary-spending.php">farm subsidies</a>, then that all sounds okay to me.</p>
<p>Anyway, consider this <a class="reference external" href="/2010/01/12/in-which-my-ignorance-of-finance-is-revealed/">another plea</a> for explaining the obvious thing(s) I'm missing. At the moment I find myself convinced that this strategy <a class="reference external" href="http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/archives/2010/01/what-will-the-spending-freeze-amount-to.php">could blow up quite easily</a>. Certainly the last few weeks haven't instilled a ton of confidence in the Democrats' political skill. In fact, odds of this play working seem low!&nbsp; The idea that defusing this <em>one last minority critique</em> will yield dividends is a mistake that's been made many times in the past few months.&nbsp; Still, this specific proposal doesn't seem obviously crazy to me, or even that destructive.&nbsp; And though I'm in no position to say, it seems likely that <em>somebody</em> in the administration thinks it'll help in the fall.</p>
<p>* Obviously another stimulus becomes untenable under this proposal. Was that really all that likely, though?</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> <a class="reference external" href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/26/obama-liquidates-himself/">Yikes</a>. Okay.</p>
<p><strong>BUT ALSO:</strong> <a class="reference external" href="http://motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2010/01/spending-freeze-kabuki">This</a>. Which seems dumb, but okay.&nbsp; &quot;It's almost certain that Congress will pass, and the president will sign, a jobs bill&quot;, though? Well, okay, maybe!&nbsp; I don't know how to read all these sorts of tea leaves, and I'm not on any secret listservs or conference calls or anything like that. But it kind of seems to me like the Republicans have been complaining about ARRA's (alleged -- but absolute!) ineffectiveness for a while now, laying the groundwork for obstruction of any last-ditch effort to fix the economy before the election (which should be done! But c'mon, at this point it obviously won't save anybody.).&nbsp; I mean, yes, clearly everyone is about to start <em>talking</em> about jobs.&nbsp; I'm unclear on why folks think that'll turn into something, though.</p>

                    <p>It's official: the New York Times is erecting a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/21/business/media/21times.html">partial paywall</a>.</p>
<p>The first thing to say about this is that it's not going to work.&nbsp; Not in a technical sense. You can't give away your content for free some of the time, then stop -- not when the cost of reproducing that content is zero.&nbsp; It seems likely that users will be asked for an email address in order to use the site at all.&nbsp; But of course it would be easy to generate a ton of accounts and then build a firefox plugin to cycle between them (with some scripting, your monthly free-article-views can be multiplied by the number of captchas you're willing to fill out).&nbsp; Or&nbsp; you could create a site that caches NYT content, reducing the need for &quot;spending&quot; your free credits.&nbsp; Or you could make a browser plugin that uses P2P to serve viewed content to others who've asked for it after their credits are spent.</p>
<p>None of that's likely to be necessary, though -- the NYT has created <a class="reference external" href="http://nytimes.blogspace.com/genlink">loopholes</a> for bloggers and search engines before, and I imagine they'll do so again: it's just too tempting, and their future is too uncertain to close off any avenues of imagined salvation.&nbsp; But it will probably be fairly simple to take advantage of those loopholes for general reading.&nbsp; The web simply wasn't designed with the sorts of systems necessary to prevent that from happening.</p>
<p>Of course, even though the proposed scheme, like all other half-hearted (aka commercially viable) DRM systems, is technically hopeless, the system might work in a practical sense.&nbsp;&nbsp; Most people won't bother with the circumvention techniques that will emerge.&nbsp; People still make money selling DVDs even though CSS is cracked, for instance.&nbsp; But, as others have noted, the papers that have had the most success with paywalls are the ones that have asked readers to spend someone else's money on a subscription -- their employer's money, typically.&nbsp; I doubt the NYT can pull that trick off.</p>
<p>I don't have a solution, really.&nbsp; If I were in their shoes, would I try to put up a paywall? Maybe. If you're ever going to try, you should do so while your cultural import is at its height, which means as soon as possible -- the old media oligarchy is clearly set for steady decline.&nbsp; But if I were going to build a wall, I certainly wouldn't build cracks into it.&nbsp; A subscription-only model would radically diminish the paper's influence and consequently transform its components. But the choice may be between that and oblivion, and if it is, the time to choose is now.</p>
<p>They won't, though.</p>

                    <p><a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/sbma44/status/7712418746">I was wrong</a> about SMS donations to Haiti lining the pockets of mobile carriers: I'm told that the carriers are waiving their fees (which normally consume about half of the funds donated through SMS). I'm happy to be proven wrong! If you want to give to relief efforts by texting, you can do so without worrying that your money will be wasted. I still wish you wouldn't, though.</p>
<p>By waiving their fees the P-SMS vendors have escaped the following critique, but it still holds for the general case: premium SMS is an expensive way to donate. And it's going to remain so. Your mobile carrier has a monopoly on adding things to your phone bill. Like room service, buyers of P-SMS are part of a captive audience, and will always pay more than he or she would for the same good in more competitive arenas.</p>
<p>Just how bad is the carriers' cut?&nbsp; It's a little tough to say, though the most often-cited number is 50%.&nbsp; If you look at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.mgive.com/Pricing.aspx">this page</a>, from mGive, the prices actually look pretty good!&nbsp; They're competitive, at least, with what you might get charged by a bulk email vendor for handling your nonprofit's fundraising.&nbsp; But then you see something like <a class="reference external" href="http://www.txt4giving.com/price.html">this</a>, from a vendor in Europe -- a more developed P-SMS market -- and realize that mGive's slice of the pie doesn't include the fees charged by carriers, which dwarf the processor's cut.</p>
<p>I'm glad that the carriers aren't taking a percentage this time. But I suspect it's a relatively cynical -- and canny -- decision on their part. If you use P-SMS to provide aid to Haitians, you're helping to legitimize and standardize P-SMS. More organizations will consider adopting it -- will feel they <em>need</em> to adopt it -- and, to whatever extent it's used as a substitute for giving through mechanisms with lower costs, it will hurt the cause of charitable giving.</p>
<p>Perhaps the situation will eventually improve. Certainly the enormous cut that carriers routinely take is impossible to justify. But when you consider that the cost of normal SMS has been increasing as the service becomes more popular -- despite expanding network capacity and very low costs to carriers -- I think there's reason for pessimism (in terms of pure bandwidth, SMS is by far the most expensive type of data that is bought by normal consumers (by which I mean people who are not in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, nor on their way to the moon)).</p>
<p>I'm sorry to have provided incorrect information this morning about the specific case of using P-SMS to give to Haitian relief efforts, but I have no regrets at all about pushing people away from P-SMS giving in general. It's a bad deal, and I think it's likely to remain so. You shouldn't give it your business, and you shouldn't imply to others that doing so is a good idea.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Via comments, I see that the situation is yet <em>more</em> complicated.&nbsp; There's something called the <a class="reference external" href="http://mobilegiving.org/?page_id=51">Mobile Giving Foundation</a>, which seems to be a coalition of wireless operators who vet nonprofits and waive their normal predatory fees for those who qualify.&nbsp; I think that's how it works, anyway -- the site isn't very clear about it, and certainly makes no mention of what normal fees for P-SMS are.</p>
<p>It still appears to me to be an effort to promote P-SMS and deflect criticism, and I see no assurances that the fee waiver is a permanent policy.&nbsp; Judge for yourself, but I'm still pretty skeptical, and will not be donating via text message any time soon.</p>

                    <p>I gave <a class="reference external" href="http://attackerman.firedoglake.com/2010/01/11/automated-ticketing-exactly-like-rape/">Spencer short shrift</a> when I <a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/sbma44/status/7645289275">tweeted</a> earlier; he's doing the lord's work, and deserves recognition for it.</p>
<p>But, with credit established: let's assess.&nbsp; The Politico-with-more-irritating-headlines part seems fairly well done, I guess, I couldn't really say. But <a class="reference external" href="http://dailycaller.com/2010/01/09/the-beer-garden/">this</a> is offensive and inexplicable; <a class="reference external" href="http://dailycaller.com/2010/01/11/the-diary-of-s-e-cupp/">this</a> reads like the first entry from an about-to-be-abandoned blogspot site; and <a class="reference external" href="http://dailycaller.com/2010/01/11/welcome-to-ask-matt-labash/">this</a> -- well, I guess we've all run into that one guy who gets drunk and ruddy and decides to boom forth some comedy, because his unapologetic, un-PC take on current events never fails to elicit big laffs from people who know how important his dad is.&nbsp; But most of us have the good sense to smile, say &quot;that's okay&quot; when he spills his drink on us, and make our excuses.&nbsp; We certainly don't <em>publish</em> the guy's nonsense.</p>
<p>Anyway, almost all of these examples are stolen from <a class="reference external" href="http://www.vanityfair.com/online/wolcott/2010/01/if-the-day-one-of.html">James Wolcott</a>, who also manages much better one-liners than I can (I stole the other one from Alex G).&nbsp; But really: the opinion section needs, um, tweaking.&nbsp; You can't just take the celebrity-fueled idiocy of HuffPo opinion pieces, subtract the celebrity and expect things to work out.</p>
<p>I suspect there are a bunch of competent, harried young reporters hammering away at the substantive side of this operation.&nbsp; I might not like the audience they're courting or the way they're courting it, but I know people like them, I know that they're in a tough line of work, and I wish them well.&nbsp; But for their sake, here's hoping something gets done about that Superfund site of an opinion section.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Alright, this is true: last week, when DCist posted about the story, I came across <a class="reference external" href="http://jimtreacher.com/archives/002152.html">this post</a> ` &lt;<a class="reference external" href="http://dctrawler.dailycaller.com/2010/01/11/last-week-i-saw-a-police-sting-like-a-block-away-from-the-office/">http://dctrawler.dailycaller.com/2010/01/11/last-week-i-saw-a-police-sting-like-a-block-away-from-the-office/</a>&gt;`__ and briefly took it at face value.&nbsp; Then I read back in the archives a bit and became convinced that the site must be a parody blog set up by someone from TWI (the connection to the recovered-camera story is what fueled my suspicions).&nbsp; I concluded that if I knew who Jim Treacher was it'd probably be hilarious, but I don't, so I mostly just felt mildly irritated to have been taken in by that last entry.&nbsp; Earlier ones betrayed a less refined comic voice -- one that was a little too upfront with the &quot;diary of my class trip to DC&quot; tone that I took to be meant to belittle the real Treacher.</p>
<p>Anyway, nope, <a class="reference external" href="http://dctrawler.dailycaller.com/2010/01/11/last-week-i-saw-a-police-sting-like-a-block-away-from-the-office/">it's the real thing</a>, and I'm very confused.</p>

<p>But this is all premature.&nbsp; The voters of Connecticut deserve to decide for themselves.&nbsp; If Linda does gain the nomination, she can count on my support, likely via the pay-per-view wing of her fundraising operation.</p>

                    <p>It's a little silly to be writing a third post about <em>Avatar</em>, particularly after seeing <em>Up in the Air</em> over the holiday and regaining some perspective on what movies can actually do.&nbsp; But this is about technology!</p>
<p>After <em>Avatar</em> we sat around Rocket Bar, snapping the 3D glasses in half and trying to recreate the day we spent screwing around with polarizing filters in middle school physics class (though more drunkenly this time). As with all 3D-via-2D-surface technology, different images need to be delivered to each eye, and since the glasses weren't the stupid red/blue combo from days of yore, we figured that they were doing so by delivering left-eye and right-eye frames in different polarities of light, with correspondingly different polarizing filters to keep the signals distinct.&nbsp; Combining the two filters ought to have let us filter out <em>all</em> light.&nbsp; Or so the classic experiment goes.</p>
<p>But it didn't work!&nbsp; Well, maybe it did, a little.&nbsp; When you put the lenses in front of each other and rotated one 90 degrees, there was a noticeable dimming, but not the total blackout that I expected.</p>
<p>Today a gentleman named Daniel posted some information to the HacDC list explaining what's going on: the light isn't linearly polarized, it's <em>circularly</em> polarized.&nbsp; I can't claim to really understand this, but the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_polarization">relevant wikipedia page</a> contains a diagram that almost fools me into thinking I do.&nbsp; More from Daniel:</p>
<blockquote>
... circular polarization is a lot like linear polarization and unless you're viewing circularly polarized light it IS a linear polarizing filter. However if you're viewing circularly polarized light then the benefit over linear-only is that you can turn your head from side to side without losing the effect (not real clear on how this works). RealD's breakthrough was in coming up with a cheap way to combine the linear filter with a quarter wave plate in one package without costly lamination, so they've brought the more advanced circular technology into the mainstream by making it affordable. However, there is additional cost in that the screen has to be coated in aluminum paint or something that will reflect the light while maintaining polarization.</blockquote>
<p>Interesting!&nbsp; The <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RealD_Cinema">RealD wikipedia page</a> fills in some more blanks.&nbsp; There are really only four parts to the system: a high-end digital projector that can manage crazily high frame rates and which your theater has hopefully already bought; the aforementioned polarity-preserving coating on the screen;&nbsp; a polarizing filter that sits in front of the projector, rapidly flipping between directions of circular polarization as right eye/left eye frames pop out of the projector; and the glasses, which are just specially-treated plastic.&nbsp; So there you have it.</p>
<p>What may be even more interesting than RealD's tech is how this will all play out in the home theater space.&nbsp; Matt told me that he'd spoken with his dad, who's a screenwriter (among other things), and that the industry is extremely excited about the prospects of <em>Avatar</em> because people can only get the 3D experience in the theater -- and anything that can prop up the perpetually-ailing (but completely essential-to-the-industry! for reasons of&nbsp; history, vanity and stupidity) theater business will be very welcome indeed.&nbsp; So it'll be nice to have that precious 3D magic bottled up in the theaters, ensuring a steady stream of fat-walleted rubes.</p>
<p>Except, of course, that <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Cameron%27s_Avatar:_The_Game">the Avatar videogame, which you will play at home, is going to be 3D</a>.&nbsp; Actually, this is technology that's been out for a while.&nbsp; Rather than fancy alternating-frame polarization, which a normal TV can't manage, the viewer wears glasses with LCD shutters that snap on and off to control which frames each of her eyes sees.</p>
<p>This kind of setup <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/product_Geforce_3D_Vision_Glasses_us.html">doesn't appear to be particularly cheap at the moment</a> -- you need some wireless syncing stuff in there too, not just amped-up solar calculator technology -- but it's certainly not unattainably expensive, and you can bet that the price will drop tremendously when someone begins pushing this as an essential home theater amenity and not just a niche gamer accessory.&nbsp; For all I know the <em>Avatar</em> game will drop the price considerably -- I imagine it'll be shipping SKUs that include the glasses.</p>
<p>And at that point, it's hard to imagine that the industry won't shoot itself in the foot, reenabling piracy when it foolishly decides to buy whatever DRM snake oil it's being pushed by tech company salespeople to excuse the lucrative sale of Blu-Ray 3D discs.&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean, sure, in-theater cam work would be more difficult with a 3D film, but this stuff is getting distributed digitally anyway.&nbsp; I suspect we'll see 3D torrents within 8 months of the first home theater-compatible 3D movie release.&nbsp; Then we'll see some codec adjustments to make the formats more space-efficient, and then we'll be back at the status quo.&nbsp; And then, as the joke must inevitably go: on to Smell-O-Vision/the iTablet/whatever, the new savior of the film industry.&nbsp; I just hope this silly 3D cycle completes its run before I'm forced to buy any stupidly 3D-capable audiovisual equipment.</p>

                    <p>Well, the holiday break wasn't quite the triumphant return to blogging/exercise/filial-website-development that I'd hoped.&nbsp; It was plenty enjoyable, though, with an awfully nice stretch of time spent in Cazenovia and what has to be considered a successful New Year's -- certainly it was an improvement over last year's edition, if only because the bodily fluids spilled at this party were merely couch-threatening rather than life-threatening.&nbsp; Honestly, though, even the Mystery Puker acquitted himself well: that semi-comatose young man and his Brother With The Enigmatic Accent left sheepishly and cooperatively, but not before handing Charles $60 for &quot;cleaning costs&quot;/hungover New Year's Day dinner.&nbsp; Well done! If you asked Emily Post about the best way to go about regurgitating in a stranger's house, that is exactly what she'd tell you to do.</p>
<p>This year the special Party MVP award goes to Dave and the Governess, who were there at the front lines and quick to deal with all the unpleasantness.&nbsp; Someday, when life becomes more like the Lord of the Rings movies I watched over the weekend, there will be alabaster statues of you, next to the ones of Courtney, Radley, Becks, Ficke, and all the other New Year's Party heroes from the Fourth Age of Men.</p>
<p>As for the Christmas holiday -- well, I was hopelessly, embarrassingly spoiled.&nbsp; The two most egregious single pieces of loot: a new Weller soldering iron from my sister and her boyfriend and, from Emily, a Bosch jigsaw that I'm hesitant to look up on Amazon lest I find myself horrified at how much she spent.&nbsp; I'm pretty excited to start making (hopefully progressively-less-) ugly wooden boxes once the temperature in the garage becomes tolerable.&nbsp; In addition to those I also received really lovely, thoughtful gifts from Emily's mom and sister, my own mother, my dad, and really everyone who puts up with my nonsense.&nbsp; I am feeling quite grateful and more than a little sheepish about it all.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>Via Yglesias and Spencer, io9 makes the race-based case against the movie: <a class="reference external" href="http://io9.com/5422666/when-will-white-people-stop-making-movies-like-avatar">When Will White People Stop Making Movies Like &quot;Avatar&quot;?</a> It's a good piece, and worth reading.</p>
<p>It's a lousy headline, though. First, the answer is obvious. Second, while I think this is a valid reading of <em>Avatar</em> and movies like it, I think it makes some unfortunate implications about the motivations of the people making these films. The self-congratulatory white guilt narrative discussed emerges from narrative necessity as least as much as it arises from an incoherent, subconscious and pervasive sense of racial culpability. Put another way: it's not <em>just</em> liberal guilt! It's professional laziness, too!</p>
<p>Consider an alternate explanation for the movie's setup. We're writing a script! We've gotten an impressive rendering farm online and built these neat cameras and the crew jackets are all printed up, but there are still a few nagging details to work out before we start rolling. For instance, we need a protagonist around which the action will revolve. He or she needs to have an arc. And the opposing sides of the central conflict need to be drawn in stark Manichaean terms — the innocents need to seem super-innocent — because we're not trying to make That Kind of Movie. When things blow up at the end, we want to audience to be happy!</p>
<p>All of this can lead us directly to a colonial narrative, and it can do so without anyone trying to atone for white privilege at all. It also explains <em>Romeo Must Die</em> perfectly well, for example. And <em>The Transporter</em>. And <em>Total Recall</em> (though admittedly that movie added some pleasantly confusing recursion). And <em>The Professional</em>. And really just about every other action movie, where a protagonist recognizes his complicity in an evil enterprise and then assumes an unrealistically prominent (and violent!) role in resolving the central injustice.</p>
<p>When you draw boundaries between factions along planetary lines, it makes sense to insert race as a dimension in your story. And once that happens, I agree that an insulting and naive sort of primitivism is sure to follow -- something that Reihan gets at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.forbes.com/2009/12/20/avatar-media-james-cameron-opinions-columnists-reihan-salam_print.html">here</a> (though there's a <em>hell</em> of a lot of projection going on in that piece -- the movie says nothing about half the claims that Reihan makes about the Na'vi).</p>
<p>But I think that the strictures of dumb action movies are what really determines the shape of <em>Avatar</em>. Sure, Cameron's only too happy to toss in some junk about Iraq, and the environment, and race. Again, the white guilt narrative isn't an incorrect reading. But I think it is a mistake to assign it outsize importance -- if you do so you wind up in weird places, like the blog post quoted by that io9 piece that essentially complains about Cameron not casting an ethnic Na'vi actor for his lead role.&nbsp; I mean, you do realize you were wearing 3D glasses, right?</p>

                    <p>So, look: the conservatives have a point: this movie does not present an even-handed consideration of the case for rapacious, imperial, homicidal, psychotic resource extraction. Probably there are some really cool consumer electronics that were made possible by burning down the ancestral homeland of that indigenous population!&nbsp; Not once does James Cameron's script discuss the boost in Na'vi GDP made possible by the incineration of their psychic soul tree thing.&nbsp; For shame.</p>
<p>Seriously, though: any conservatives who object to this movie are automatically giving up the game.&nbsp; Are you really taking offense at a polemic against <em>murdering natives and destroying the environment for naked greed?</em> Really: you think your ideological program stands in opposition to the idea of not killing innocent people and stealing their land?&nbsp; I mean, if that's the war you want to fight, be my guest.&nbsp; We can deal with that.&nbsp; But I sort of thought we had called a truce and agreed that we were all trying to figure out a positive-sum way to reconcile our unbearable hippie nonsense with your corporate overlords' ruthlessness.&nbsp; We were all going to drink Coca-cola in idyllic natural settings, no?&nbsp; I guess I just think it might be better for you to sit this one out.</p>
<p>But whatever. All that aside, it really was an awesome movie, in the original sense of the word.&nbsp; A lot of comparisons are being made to a lot of different movies, but I think the most relevant one is <em>The Fifth Element</em>. Like Jim Cameron, Luc Besson made a bunch of great movies, then revisited a story he had been mulling since before he could conceive of decent stories.&nbsp; <em>The Fifth Element</em> was a visually arresting, relentlessly kinetic and occasionally emotionally-compelling spectacle, and because of all that it didn't really matter that its core was totally risible <em>Captain Planet</em> bullshit.</p>
<p>I think the same can be said of <em>Avatar</em>.&nbsp; This movie would be better without narration. It would probably be better without dialogue!&nbsp; But by saying that I don't mean to imply that it's trading solely in effects-driven flash rather than story.&nbsp; It's just that the story is so vast, so archetypal, that the specifics don't matter, and are consequently allowed to devolve into camp (really: <a class="reference external" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0298814/">unobtainium</a>?).&nbsp; THIS IS A BIG FUCKING MOVIE.&nbsp; That's all I can really say about it with any sense of confidence.&nbsp; That, and: go see it.&nbsp; Wear the stupid glasses.&nbsp; You'll like it.</p>

                    <p>If you ask me, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/06/us/06charity.html?_r=1&amp;sudsredirect=true">this New York Times article</a> is fairly asinine.&nbsp; Is our collective decision to exempt the nonprofit sector from taxation a good idea? Well, I don't know.&nbsp; I think you can make a pretty good case that it isn't -- that the sorts of problems that charities try to solve would be more constructively handled with coordinated state action, and that there's not much of a reason at all for exempting various types of membership organizations from taxation.</p>
<p>But the article really doesn't get into any of that.&nbsp; Instead it just talks about the large <em>number of nonprofits</em>, rather than discussing where the big tax expenditures actually lie.&nbsp; Then they throw in some anecdotes about charities for donkey rescue and sending clown noses to soldiers, which, ha ha, sound pretty stupid to readers that don't care about donkeys or clown supplies (but probably do care about various tax-exempt universities with big endowments and profitable sports programs (also tax-free) that've <em>still</em> been raising tuition much faster than inflation).</p>
<p>At any rate, we're working on the nonprofit sector over at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.subsidyscope.com">Subsidyscope</a>, and will have more to say about it soon. But for now, suffice it to say that health care and education is where the money is in the nonprofit sector.&nbsp; Podunk institutes and foundations that seem to be put together to secure prestige for their organizers more than to do good works might offend our sensibilities, but they're not really costing our government all that much money.</p>

                    <p>I should take this opportunity to note the awesomeness of last night's premiere of <em>Steven Seagal: Lawman</em>. Gabe Delahaye ably sums up the basic mechanic that they've established for the season:</p>
<p><img alt="image1" class="aligncenter" src="/static/2009/12/03/seagal-20091203-160858.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 154px;" /></p>
<p>But it's oh-so-much more than just a crappy, bloated, arthritic has-been hassling poor black men in run-down parts of Louisiana.&nbsp; There's also the poorly-affected cajun accent! And the constant prefacing of every utterance with &quot;as a lifelong practitioner of the martial arts...&quot;! And the relentless pomposity that Seagal directs at his fellow officers, like a tourist advising a gypsy how to better beg for coins.&nbsp; He gives driving directions; he helps a supposedly hapless overweight colleague train for firearm certification; he expounds wisely and constantly on how his wisdom offsets the constant danger that they're all in (nice kevlar vest, incidentally! Though I couldn't help but notice that the officers who aren't unstoppable human weapons don't seem to feel they need them...).</p>
<p>It's a great, great show, is what I'm trying to say. Talk to your Tivo about it.</p>

                    <p>Hi there. You might have noticed me not blogging. Well, work's been busy, and I've been uninspired by the post-Halloween lull. Mostly I've been retreating into messing around with videogames and technology in an unproductive way (though I <em>have</em> leveled up quite a bit).</p>
<p>Some things that happened:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Charles put on a classical guitar concert! It was pretty great: those in attendance were unanimous in their affection for Charles' guitar playing and their horror at my turn as a page-turner. &quot;Creepy&quot; and &quot;cadaverous&quot; were adjectives that may have been applied. Oh well. The bigger problem was the audience's unwillingness to travel through the rain to our apartment after the show, which led me to consume considerably more cheese and red wine than could be strictly justified within the evening's sophisticated sensibility.</li>
<li>WEP-cracking: as easy as the nerds have warned you. Well, if there's a client associated. I'm still figuring out how to efficiently manage it when it's just me versus the access point. But though it took a little work, running Backtrack 4 off a bootable USB drive lets weaponize my eeePC 1005HA pretty efficiently. Airoscript-ng is giving me some MAC address-related guff, but I'll sort it out eventually. Next up: tackling the considerably-more-formidable WPA.</li>
<li>I'm pretty sure that I have tendonitis from trying to play &quot;Feel the Pain&quot; on hard in <em>Rock Band 2</em>.</li>
<li></li>
<li><em>Borderlands</em> is really fun. Or if not fun, then compelling. Or if not compelling, then addictive. And if addictive, then debilitating. An FPS where you collect experience points: dear lord someone save me from this waking nightmare but not until I get just a little more (I can use this new fire revolver at level 26) and oh god what have I become</li>
<li>I'm working on a neat electronics project for the new office at work, though it's driving me slightly insane as I try to get python running on a WRT54GL. Turns out it's harder than getting it to run on a Fonera! Which is unexpected and therefore dumb. More on this when it's actually finished.</li>
<li>It looks like I'll probably be heading to Tbilisi in early December to help an NGO get their mobile and web infrastructure up and running. It's exciting! But the whirlwind nature of the trip is making me dread travel involved. I get a day in London on the way over, but heading back involves a 19 hour itinerary of flights. Ugh.</li>
</ul>

                    <p>Halloween's over, and I've finally started to reassemble the pieces of my shattered life.&nbsp; It's amazing how one little coffin-and-spider-construction project can derail gym attendance, laundry completion and sleep.</p>
<p>But man, it was a good party.&nbsp; People danced all night; the booze held out; no one got sick; no one's costume was ignited by a candle; and even the many, many people who fell down the stairs all emerged miraculously unhurt. Then, at the end, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7y1tynWh5WI">Blelvis</a> showed up.&nbsp; Thanks to everyone who came, and especially those of you who elected not to steal anything.&nbsp; You can find photos <a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/fickeween/">here</a> that prove the whole thing happened (and if you have photos of your own, please consider uploading them to Flickr with the tag &quot;fickeween&quot;).</p>
<p>Now! As you might know, this was the third installment of this particular party in this particular house.&nbsp; Unfortunately, it might be the last: the house is on the market, and although the asking price seems to reflect the owners' relative prioritization of, say, fake Tiffany lamps versus, say, non-leaking roofs, it's possible that we'll need a new venue for next October. Please get in touch if you or someone you know has access to a network of abandoned steam tunnels, or parents who are using their retirement to renovate abandoned mental hospitals, or even just knowledge of a cave that stretches deep -- deeper than human feet should tread -- toward the eldritch horrors at the Earth's core.</p>

<p>The comparisons between this particular movement and purely political movements can be extended further than you might think -- right down to some of the same issues that <a class="reference external" href="http://reason.com/archives/2009/10/20/are-property-rights-enough">Kerry</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://timothyblee.com/?p=1360">Tim</a> have been discussing this week in an entirely different context, where the removal of licenses/laws isn't enough to address for the pernicious effects of less clearly-defined norms and dynamics.&nbsp; It's also been an important part of my ideological education: watching the continued success of free software despite the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flame_war">seemingly pathological dysfunction of many of its contributors</a> has gone a long way toward convincing me that our society isn't (necessarily) doomed.</p>

<p>It made me wonder, though: of drug dealers, professional videogame players and style guide authors, who do you think contributes least to society?&nbsp; I feel like pro gamers are solidly in the positive column, if only thanks to the wealth they generate through Mountain Dew endorsements.&nbsp; The other two are trickier -- you'd have to figure out how many drug dealers participate in violence, and how much violence the style guide authors elicit.&nbsp; Anyway, I think it's certainly an open question.</p>

                    <p>Not to undercut <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ryanavent.com/blog/?p=2239">Ryan's point</a>, which seems to me to be correct — geoengineering probably <em>is</em> much harder than its boosters currently think, and anyone who ignores the experts calling for first taking a crack at emission reduction is a dope — but I think his point's getting a bit lost in all the me-too-ery. <a class="reference external" href="http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2009/10/geoengineering-freakiness">Here's Kevin Drum</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
But geoengineering isn't something that a single country can pull off. It's a global problem, after all. That means treaties and conferences and endless debate over costs and benefits and what the target temperatures ought to be and who's responsible for side effects. There just aren't any easy answers here.</blockquote>
<p>I'm pretty sure this is wrong: geoengineering <em>is</em> something that a single country could pull off.&nbsp; That's sort of the whole point. The Atlantic got <a class="reference external" href="http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200907/climate-engineering">a bunch of experts to say exactly that</a> earlier this year -- actually, they say it's something that Richard Branson could manage if he were so inclined.</p>
<p>And, contrary to what's being asserted, I think history makes it clear that undertaking massive scientific and engineering projects that put foreigners at risk is something that's actually pretty easy to get away with. I mean, consider that time we <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhopal_disaster">gassed tens of thousands of Indians to death</a>. Or that time we were worried about <a class="reference external" href="http://www.fas.org/sgp/othergov/doe/lanl/docs1/00329010.pdf">the Manhattan Project igniting the atmosphere</a> (PDF) but went ahead with it anyway. Or US agribusiness's release of GM food products into the wild. Or all the space junk we've flown up over and crashed down past foreign countries. And that's to say nothing of the environmental devastation that the first world has wrought upon any number of countries with resources we fancy.</p>
<p>Again, this isn't to minimize the argument that geoengineering is unlikely to be the simple cure-all that some imagine. I'm certainly no expert on the subject, but that seems right to me.</p>
<p>But if we decided we wanted to do it, it's pretty hard for me to imagine anyone stopping us. That's the appeal of these solutions: they sidestep the collective action problem that CO<sub>2</sub> reduction represents.&nbsp; You could (and should) attach to geoengineering proposals the same collaborative hurdles that emission reduction requires.&nbsp; But you don't really <em>have</em> to.&nbsp; I'm sure you'd see some flushed faces around Turtle Bay if we started pumping sulfur dioxide out of military jets circling the globe, but no number of submarine meetings of the Maldives cabinet could seriously dissuade a superpower from undertaking some mad science in the face of what it earnestly believes to be an existential threat.&nbsp; Hell, it might even be possible to dump SO<sub>2</sub> into the atmosphere in a sufficiently diffuse way that other countries couldn't easily prove we'd done it.&nbsp; You know, like how the government is using <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemtrail">chemtrails</a> to build an electromagnetic superweapon.</p>

                    <p>Matt sent me <a class="reference external" href="http://yle.fi/uutiset/news/2009/10/1mb_broadband_access_becomes_legal_right_1080940.html">this link</a>, which mentions that Finland has just declared broadband access a legal right. By next summer, all Finnish citizens will be entitled to a 1mbps connection; within a few years that speed requirement will climb to 100mbps.</p>
<p>Perhaps predictably, I think this is great. Big government! Technology! Heedless disregard for cost or affected corporations! What's not to like?</p>
<p>Actually, though, the English-speaking press seems a little fuzzy on what exactly this announcement it means. It appears to be a guarantee of access, not a promise of internet service paid for by the state. It's also not quite as novel as it sounds: a French court <a class="reference external" href="http://technology.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/tech_and_web/article6478542.ece">declared net access a human right</a> earlier this year (though I believe that decision was expected to be quickly overturned).</p>
<p>But whatever the specifics, a lot of people will no doubt find the idea of enshrining network access as a right to be frivolous or silly. They shouldn't.</p>
<p>I think the temptation is to romanticize rights as timeless philosophical axioms; to connect them to an imagined state of nature from which your preferred understanding of the social contract then arises. It's no doubt difficult to admit technology into that picture. But what's the second amendment if not a guaranteed right to technology? &quot;Arms&quot; is, admittedly, a bit more poetically vague than &quot;100mbps broadband connection&quot;. But considering all the headaches that've been produced by that bit of American lyricism, it's hard to blame the Finns for being specific.</p>
<p>To me it seems simple: society needs to guarantee its members the ability to do certain things, like defend themselves and communicate and participate in the economy. If the march of progress makes it absolutely or practically impossible for them to do so without access to some enabling technology, then the ability to use that technology will have to be guaranteed, too, right?</p>

                    <p>Shoot me an email. We should chat.</p>
<p>Long story short, the skies were kept safe tonight from any designs I had on synthesizing a maple-based plastique while in flight. TSA acted professionally, in the sense that they said &quot;sir&quot; as they went about their officious buffoonery.</p>
<p>If you haven't already, you should read <a class="reference external" href="http://www.schneier.com/interview-hawley.html">this interview</a> with former* TSA chief Kip Hawley, conducted by Bruce Shneier. It will make two things immediately clear.</p>
<p>First, this agency was run by a man named Kip.</p>
<p>Second, the frustrating and apparently arbitrary nonsense that you, I and all other air travelers are continually subjected to is just what it seems. When the agent tried to explain to me that the listed weight of my proscribed carryon (in grams) was evidence of its violation of the volume limit? When the woman next to me was told that the difference between the limit, in millilieters, listed on the TSA.gov printout she was holding and the limit, in milliliters, being enforced against her owed to some arcane fact involving unit conversion and Canadian passengers? These are not merely the failings of overtaxed and undertrained staff. The whole agency is awash in arbitrary authoritarianism. Shneier pulls the curtain back, and the man behind just sits there smiling at him. He's named Kip! Glad to meet ya! But he couldn't possibly comment on that thing you just said, because if he did, one of our vaguely-defined but utterly-relentless enemies might realize the obvious thing that your non-expert mind just thought of during a fit of idle pique.</p>
<p>I understand why a Democratic administration can't undo this nonsense. But I am looking forward to the day when a new Republican administration decides to help itself to an easy PR victory by undoing the liquid ban and, hopefully, driving a naked, horsewhipped Kip Hawley -- or whomever has continued his legacy --through the laughing streets of DC.</p>
<p>There. Now I feel better.</p>
<p>* It appears that Kip is out as of the Obama administration, but a permanent replacement has not yet been named. Hopefully they will either be more thoughtful, or at least have a name of similar hilarity, making it easyto update this post.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>I sort of buried this point in one of my long, super-boring net neutrality posts, but I've been going back and forth with Brooke about it on Twitter today, and consequently feel like emphasizing it: neutrality opponents would do themselves a favor by dropping the critiques that essentially say, &quot;Well, if you want to make your ISP more like the DMV, be my guest!&quot;</p>
<p>I mean, I get it: everyone hates the DMV, and the Post Office, and the IRS.&nbsp; Why, their eternal inefficiency is recorded in the formulaic sitcom scripts of our youth; for culture-free postmodern nostalgists, that's practically holy writ.</p>
<p>And actually, it <em>is</em> sort of true. I did find myself waiting at the Post Office for about 40 minutes earlier this year because they couldn't find a package that I'd gotten a delivery slip for (turns out it was already out for re-delivery, but they had no record of this).&nbsp; I've been bored at the DMV like everyone else.</p>
<p>But last week I spent 30 minutes on hold with Verizon before getting hung up on.&nbsp; This came after a visit to their store where the clerk gave me information that I know is incorrect, which came after a visit when the clerk just gave me some pamphlets (and more incorrect information) when he learned I already had an iPhone under contract. &nbsp; It took Comcast&nbsp; two appointments to get my Tivo set up when they could have just mailed me the goddamn CableCard. WTTG used to drop out during the 9 o'clock hour for some reason. Verizon once sent a collection agency after me for charges during a trial period that a clerk had assured me I wouldn't owe.&nbsp; And Emily paid for DSL for at least four months, during which time it worked <em>maybe</em> twice -- this despite both of us making repeated calls to tech support, and a couple of failed service calls.&nbsp; Hell, when my family first got DSL our troubleshooting file became so long that I had to wait about ten minutes every time I called in just so the tech could read it.</p>
<p>From everything I've seen, these experiences are not at all atypical.&nbsp; The point being: people might hate government inefficiency, but they really, <em>really</em> hate their ISPs.&nbsp; Maybe it's my own inclinations coloring my perceptions; maybe it's hopelessness in the face of bureaucracy versus fury at not getting what you paid for; but from my vantage point it's not even close: the home broadband duopoly has delivered a level of service significantly inferior to the one people expect from the public sector.</p>
<p>This is not to say that there are no good arguments to be mustered against government regulation of ISPs.&nbsp; But if you could make Comcast behave more like the water utility, most of their customers would immediately envelop you in a tearful, joyous embrace.&nbsp; The &quot;not the post office!&quot; free market trope is not only tired, but particularly ill-suited to this debate.</p>
<p><strong>TO CLARIFY:</strong> I don't think that the ISPs' awfulness is an affirmative argument <em>for</em> regulation.&nbsp; I just don't think that their wonderfulness is much of an argument <em>against</em> regulation.&nbsp; I've tried to make this distinction over at <a class="reference external" href="http://timothyblee.com/?p=1105&amp;cpage=1#comment-4523">Tim's place</a>, too.&nbsp; The broadband market is weird, and screwed up, and regulation might help or hurt or not matter much.&nbsp; But I don't know any consumers who are particularly in love with the status quo.</p>

                    <p>I just got back from seeing Pains of Being Pure at Heart at the Black Cat. It was pretty good! Honestly, they offered just about everything that you could ask of a twee-pop band. They were fresh-faced and well behaved. They were <em>so excited</em> to be in DC (&quot;we love Teenbeat!&quot;). One of them had bangs! They were exactly what you would expect, and to say that is not to diminish their charm one bit.</p>
<p>The show didn't quite click for me, though. I can come up with a lot of plausible reasons: they front-loaded the setlist, their songs only have a couple of tricks, or, most obviously: I'm too old for this. Honestly, though, I don't think that's it. I think I'm just a bit out of practice. Sommer and I were talking about this in the Red Room before the show: we need to get back in the concert-attending habit. If the two fifty+ year-olds behind me in line were any indication, it's not over for us quite yet.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there's a hell of a lot of good stuff coming to the Black Cat in the next couple of months. I'd encourage any interested parties to pester me to attend the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>10/6 - Title Tracks - $8 (backstage)</li>
<li>11/6 - Thao with the Get Down Stay Down - $15</li>
<li>11/7 - Le Loup - $12</li>
<li>11/14 - Olivia Mancini &amp; the Mates - $8 (backstage, CD release)</li>
<li>11/20 - The Wrens - $15</li>
<li>12/3 - Ted Leo Rx - $15</li>
</ul>
<p>I guess that's it. I could be talked into Bishop Allen, Girls, Dirty Projectors, that guy from Television, or virtually anyone else who isn't Art Brut. And of course the Cat isn't the only game in town. I've got tickets for Gaslight Anthem, but I also see Dinosaur Jr., the Raveonettes and Built to Spill coming up at 9:30. Headlights is coming to DC9 on 10/25, and I'm <a class="reference external" href="/2008/05/01/aots-08/">on record</a> as loving them. A bit more tentatively, I could under the right circumstances head to RNR for the Spinto Band or Titus Andronicus.</p>
<p>In short: make me go to some shows, please. I'll drop these into a Google calendar shortly; if you're interested in contributing to that effort, let me know.</p>
<p>And to irrefutably prove that I'm serious, I'm making an <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Hearos-211-High-Fidelity-Plugs/dp/tech-data/B0002CZYS4/ref=de_a_smtd">impulse purchase</a> to facilitate this resolution.

                    <p>This Roman Polanski business is bothering me. Not that he's been arrested — I meant <a class="reference external" href="http://dcist.com/2009/09/morning_roundup_selective_enforceme.php">what I said in the morning roundup</a>: arresting him was the right thing to do, and I'm glad it happened.</p>
<p>But I'm bothered by those who are on my side (if I have to have a side). There are quite a lot of people expressing the sentiment that &quot;RT &#64;someguy: Polanski is a rapist and he belongs in prison. FULL STOP.&quot; I think they're basically right. But they're making a terrible error by being so self-satisfied about it. When we punish people, it's nothing to celebrate. We should perhaps make allowances for those personally affected by the misdeeds of the party that is to be punished. But when the rest of us glory in it, 140 smug characters at a time, we have no excuse. God, but it's bloodthirsty. This is an old man who will be punished for an old crime, and it's not going to do anybody any good, not really. It's just that it has to be done.</p>
<p>When I was writing that roundup I came across the story of a teenager who had just been sentenced for the murder of two people. The young man went into a house to steal and came across a gun. He loaded it, and it appears that he then discharged it into the head of a teenage boy who was sleeping on the living room couch. He then fled, but returned to collect a jacket he had lost. He encountered the boy's mother, who was on the phone with the police, and he shot her in the ear at close range.</p>
<p>I left that out of the roundup — I take pride in omitting crime stories with a sensationally terrifying element. But can you imagine a crime more casually horrible? Still, how could anyone picture the coming decades of that boy's life in prison and feel anything but crushing sadness?</p>
<p>By saying this I don't imply that I'm above what I'm decrying — in that morning roundup I took the Polanski case and spun it into a framing device that traded on crass moralism, and I did it simply because I wanted a punchy intro that would let me get to bed on time. But I, and everyone else, should probably show a little more restraint before reveling in the misfortune of the guilty. I hope that we punish people because it serves a larger purpose; it's the means by which we recommit ourselves to a system that has just failed us. For that reason it's a hopeful but fundamentally melancholy act. If it feels otherwise, something is wrong.</p>

<blockquote>
Randomly wondered when/why RAR supplanted ZIP as the default compression scheme. Internet knows: <a class="reference external" href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000798.html">http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000798.html</a> - &#64;normative, <a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/normative/status/4370570567">9/25/2009</a></blockquote>
<p>The Coding Horror writeup is characteristically excellent, but the story is actually a little more complicated than it implies.&nbsp; It provides good reasons why RAR is superior to ZIP.&nbsp; But why hasn't RAR been beaten by something else?</p>
<p>As with many technologies, the answer lies in the balance between the advantages of the new technology and the costs of sacrificing the incumbent technology's network effects -- that, and simple timing.&nbsp; To wit: 7Zip is a format that, in most situations, is <a class="reference external" href="http://kikizas.net/en/apps.7z.html">as good or better than RAR*</a>.&nbsp; It's also an open standard, unlike RAR.</p>
<p>So why isn't 7Zip in use instead of RAR?&nbsp; I think it comes down to timing.&nbsp; The standardization of large-file trading on Usenet demanded a format that could be broken into chunks, as a single post can only carry a limited amount of binary data**.&nbsp; ZIP can handle this sort of operation -- I have fond memories of spreading friends' EGA games across innumerable bitrot-ridden 1.44M floppies -- but it's a feature that had been ignored or intentionally dropped by many Windows 95-era ZIP clients.&nbsp; RARs were also typically a few percentage points smaller than ZIPs at a time when the average home user's internet connection was several orders of magnitude slower than it is today.</p>
<p>There was a moment when piracy became professionalized, and at that moment RAR was the best thing going.&nbsp; And it's still pretty good!&nbsp; The situation is quite similar to that of the MP3 format: it's been beaten by better audio compression schemes like Ogg Vorbis and AAC, but MP3 is good enough -- and popular enough -- that it's not worthwhile to tear out out the infrastructure that's been built around it.</p>
<p>Admittedly, I doubt that RAR will remain in vogue as long as MP3 will.&nbsp; A shift in audio codec means buying hardware players with new chipsets -- and, not infrequently, acquiescing to the DRM gimmicks of whatever corporation is pushing the new format.&nbsp; Archive formats can be counted on to only matter in a flexible general-purpose computing environment, where those concerns don't really apply.&nbsp; Also, archive formats can be selected in an ad-hoc manner by release groups made of technical users that are largely immune to network effects -- the popularity or usability of their release is much less important in their insular prestige economy them than is its timing.&nbsp; For these reasons <a class="reference external" href="http://isohunt.com/torrents/7z">it's not at all uncommon to run across 7Zip torrents</a>.</p>
<p>So RAR might fall out of fashion some day. But it owes more of its popularity to being the right technology at the right time than it does to its current technical merits.</p>
<p>* This comparison asserts that RAR's dominance has to do with its &quot;repair archive&quot; functionality.&nbsp; I disagree; I've never found that feature to be reliable enough to be worthwhile.&nbsp; Usenet file-traders agree with me, and instead rely on a checksum metafile standard called SFV which helps both to correct errors and, in some situations, to replace missing files.</p>
<p>** Torrents are presumably still broken into volumes because the releases have been plucked from Usenet, which remains the font of nearly all piracy. It's also handy to be able to download a single volume and run a checksum on it to look for malware before grabbing the whole archive, but this is a relatively uncommon thing for casual users to do.</p>

                    <p>Well, the FCC has announced its net neutrality guidelines, which means it's time for those with institutional or philosophical obligations to oppose net neutrality to express some disappointment and/or outrage.&nbsp; This process will reach its apotheosis in a day or two, when the sysadmin familiars are summoned to spin some exotic technical fables about neutrality regulation sending the internet and Western civilization spiraling toward jitter-mediated destruction.&nbsp; Then they will be rebutted, then they will respond, then they will be re-rebutted -- at this point we'll be talking about something entirely different than what we meant to discuss -- and they'll proceed to cudgel their interlocutors with references to network RFCs that can only be viewed if you have a key to the CERN sub-basement.&nbsp; At that point we'll all drop it until the next time the FCC holds forth.</p>
<p>But for now my combatants are far more&nbsp; reasonable, and pleasant, and include my friend Julian Sanchez, who&nbsp; starts things off with <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cato-at-liberty.org/2009/09/21/eye-of-neutrality-toe-of-frog/">this post</a> over at Cato (full disclosure: I still have some comic books that I need to return to him).&nbsp; But bristling at today's announcement is&nbsp; a surprisingly hard job, and I'm not completely convinced that Julian's heart is in it. It's not that he doesn't have the strength of his convictions; it's just that the FCC said very little today, and even less that's plausibly objectionable.&nbsp; Arguing against transparency is tough, and the only other new guideline remains too vague to really engage with.</p>
<p>But Julian does his duty:</p>
<blockquote>
[T]hey’ll do their best to flesh out the definition of “reasonable,” but in general they’ll “evaluate alleged violations…on a case-by-case basis.” Insofar as any more rigid rule would probably be obsolete before the ink dried, I guess that’s somewhat reassuring, but it absolutely reeks of the sort of <em>ad hoc</em> “I know it when I see it” standard that leaves telecoms wondering whether some innovative practice will bring down the Wrath of Comms only after resources have been sunk into rolling it out.</blockquote>
<p>I read this and see just the opposite: the FCC is essentially saying that if ISP, Inc. is interested in undertaking some network monkey business, it would behoove them to get on the phone with Washington before they get on the phone with Cisco.&nbsp; This is a burden, I suppose, but network-wide changes are a big enough deal and pursued at a sufficiently careful pace that I don't think it's likely to be a particularly onerous one.</p>
<p>To my mind the alternative is for the ISPs to roll out an expensive network upgrade, then say &quot;Whoops!&quot; when the FCC comes calling -- they'll have some plausible excuse why they can't go back, and perhaps they could just pay a fine or better yet be grandfathered in instead?</p>
<p>Julian would rather wait and see what happens.&nbsp; I feel as though we've seen enough -- and heard enough executives saying very stupid things about what they're owed by their customers and online businesses -- that adding some clarity to the regulatory situation is probably worthwhile.</p>
<p>I think that this is ultimately a cultural difference, though.&nbsp; It's just as in <a class="reference external" href="http://www.timothyblee.com">Tim</a>'s <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=9775">net neutrality paper</a> -- which is well worth a read, incidentally.&nbsp; At the risk of boiling it down to an insultingly oversimplified nut, he's generally skeptical of regulation and generally optimistic about the market's capacity for providing incentives for being non-evil.&nbsp; He makes a good case, but ultimately I don't find it convincing; just as I'm sure he doesn't find convincing my complementarily chipper attitude toward regulation and somber concern about looming corporate malfeasance.</p>
<p>What I am relatively sure of, though, is that everyone is overstating what's at stake.&nbsp; &quot;Innovation&quot; is unlikely to be hampered -- small, agile ISPs typically sell themselves by virtue of their openness (see Speakeasy), and the lumbering behemoths still have a profit motive to push them toward clever new ways of overselling a given pipe*.&nbsp; Similarly, there's something to Tim's argument that network discrimination is unlikely to be lucrative -- for now, at least, it's hard to imagine many companies playing ball with an ISP's extortionary tactics so long as online video remains a money-losing enterprise.</p>
<p>Anyway, if you really want a properly impassioned response to this FCC business, I recommend <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cato-at-liberty.org/2009/09/21/preemptive-regulation-of-the-internet/">Jim Harper's post</a>.&nbsp; He points out that consumer pressure means that no ISP would be able to, say, <a class="reference external" href="http://torrentfreak.com/canadian-isp-is-throttling-bittorrent-traffic/">interfere with bittorrent</a> for <a class="reference external" href="http://www.broadbandreports.com/shownews/Rogers-Bit-Torrent-Cat-Mouse-71914">long</a>; that utility deregulation is an <a class="reference external" href="http://enron.com/">obviously</a> great <a class="reference external" href="http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/energy/2007-08-09-power-prices_n.htm">idea</a>; and that in a net-neutral world, interacting with your ISP might become more like your dealings with the water company and less, well, <a class="reference external" href="http://consumerist.com/5242464/worst-company-in-america-championship-aig-vs-comcast">Comcastic</a>**. That last one is meant as a criticism, apparently.</p>
<p>More seriously, though, I will say that I'm encouraged to find that this debate has advanced beyond the stage where people are constantly saying dumb or dishonest things.&nbsp; Proponents no longer picture Rosa Parks whenever they hear about subjecting packets to Quality of Service measures; opponents have mostly given up pretending that the FCC is likely to enact rules so transparently stupid that they'd bring the internet to a grinding halt.&nbsp; Now it's just about the level of philosophical gloominess you're naturally predisposed to feel toward government intervention.&nbsp; I doubt that the conversation will head anywhere productive from here, but at least we've been here before -- it's unlikely to be particularly infuriating.</p>
<p><em>* Besides which, we already know the bounds of what can ever be wrung out of a connection thanks to Claude Shannon.&nbsp; Practical improvements are possible! But this shouldn't be thought of as a field of inquiry that's amenable to bold, game-changing breakthroughs if only the heavy hand of government is kept at bay.</em></p>
<p><em>** Becks told a story about seeing someone at the gym wearing a t-shirt identifying herself as a part of Comcast's support staff.&nbsp; &quot;That's like wearing a confederate flag t-shirt,&quot; was her quip, which sounded about right to me.</em></p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Over Twitter, Julian says <a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/normative/status/4157793129">this</a>, which I think is a much better criticism:</p>
</p><!--  -->
<blockquote>
I'd b comfier w/ <a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/search?q=%23netneutrality">#netneutrality</a> if seemed boosters were thinking as much about incentive effects of specific rules as gen value of openness</blockquote>
<p>This is fair. You do occasionally see some thoughtless hippie nonsense coming from neutrality-boosters.&nbsp; But actually, changing incentives is <em>exactly</em> why I support this stuff.&nbsp; I want my ISP options to compete on price, reliability, speed and nothing else.&nbsp; I'm not interested in continuing to pay for the clever MBA who had all those &quot;SpeedBoost&quot; posters printed up.</p>
<p>Nor do I think that synergistic cross-subsidization schemes are likely to be helpful to the public.&nbsp; The example that tends to come to mind is those &quot;you can only use Visa at the Olympics&quot; ads.&nbsp; I guess we're supposed to think that the Olympics have only bothered to support the best or most important card.&nbsp; Or maybe that Visa's exclusive arrangement means that they're going to make ticket-buying easier by paying for some more kiosks that wouldn't be affordable in an open market? Whatever.&nbsp; In reality the setup is almost certainly this: Visa has taken some money from me and merchants I do business with in order to make life slightly less convenient for people attending the Olympics, then taken a bunch more money and spent it on telling me all about this bold innovation.&nbsp; Because they'd rather do this than be forced to compete by offering more favorable terms on their lending.</p>
<p>That's the sort of innovation I expect to see if we allow inventively-tiered pricing and partnerships.&nbsp; It's an unfortunately blunt mechanism, but if regulation is what it takes to convince Verizon that it's selling a commodity, that's fine by me.&nbsp; The market that's going to grow up on top of that system is more important than the principle of avoiding any imposition on the ISPs.&nbsp; Put another way: it may be that the drab, regulated water system has cheated me of consumer-facing innovations like leased rootbeer faucets, or additives that would save me from cleaning the tub as often.&nbsp; But I don't care about that: those gimmicks -- any water utility gimmicks -- are of miniscule importance compared to having a water system that works safely, predictably and efficiently.&nbsp; If Comcast needs to become a more boring place to work and a slightly less exciting business than it otherwise might be, it's not going to bother me even a little bit.</p>

<p>But I also find it kind of infuriating that these incumbent vendors are able to impose rents on the entrepreneur behind this effort.&nbsp; Sure, maybe he's glad to not have to finance or run a cart.&nbsp; But it's equally likely that he just isn't being allowed to compete because the city is artificially constraining the ability of food carts to compete.&nbsp; Instead some petrified halfsmoke purveyor gets some fraction of every dollar that this guy's ingenuity deserves.&nbsp; Why?!</p>
<p>Admittedly, my outrage at this probably has something to do with my own socioeconomic destiny.&nbsp; As a white guy who's getting older, fatter and more prosperous, it's only natural that I begin to feel increasingly outraged by insults to the burrito-selling Randian supermen that the market, freed from the clutches of incompetent District bureaucrats, would naturally elevate.&nbsp; To imply otherwise would threaten the legitimacy of my own relatively anointed status!&nbsp; And that's ridiculous: I am, after all, a valuable member of society, deserving of the respect and flat-panel TVs that come with my extraordinary and carefully-cultivated skills (ask me about the brilliant system I've devised for making sure I respond to email properly).</p>

                    <p><img alt="image1" class="alignright" src="/static/2009/08/23/appa-20090824-233346.jpg" style="width: 270px; height: 233px;" />The <a class="reference external" href="http://www.theawl.com/2009/08/avatar-promo-is-the-greatest-promo-ever-will-change-the-way-you-watch-promos-etc">internet</a> has been assuring me that there's a new movie called <em>Avatar</em> that's coming out, and it's going to be amazing. I agree! Prior to this weekend I'd consumed the source material furtively, typically while sitting in hotel rooms waiting to fall asleep, or for someone to get out of the shower, or for the goddamn downstairs buffet to open already. That changed this weekend: Emily and I caught the end of a marathon on TV and were hooked. The first season can be streamed from Netflix, and we're already about halfway through it.</p>
<p>Except apparently this isn't <em>Avatar</em>. I mean, it is. But that's not <strong>the</strong> <em>Avatar</em>, the one getting directed by James Cameron. Ours is <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em>, the Peabody Award-winning three-season animated series that's deeply influenced by Hayao Miyazaki's films. But the apparently-nominal <em>Avatar</em> that's gotten everyone else excited is a bulbous epic that appears to be one part Warcraftian Night Elf cinematic and one part <a class="reference external" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108843/">M.A.N.T.I.S.</a> I've got no idea why people find this premise compelling: it's hardly the first time that hard sci-fi specificity has been used to excuse high fantasy ridiculousness. But eh, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZH149fYbUM">whatever</a>.</p>
<p>What I can say is that this airbender business is pretty solid. It's admittedly all a bit Captain Planet; and the middle standalone episodes of each twenty-episode season are no better or worse than a standard kid's cartoon. But the art is of a consistently high quality, and the important episodes -- if this were the X-Files, we'd call them the mythology episodes -- are always engaging (and charming!). The super-powered fight choreography is also noteworthy: it's inventive, and it doesn't repeat itself. That's unusual.</p>
<p>Oh, also, one of the characters has a gigantic flying bison. In other words: recommended.</p>
<p>(For what it's worth, this property is also being adapted into a series of three films M. Night Shyamalan; I don't have particularly high hopes for them, though.)</p>

<p>On the other hand, I also agree with Julian that the government's proper response is probably to threaten to regulate rather than to actually regulate.&nbsp; It seems like the relevant bureaucrats might agree: <a class="reference external" href="http://timothyblee.com/?p=379&amp;cpage=1#comment-84">I think this may be the tack that the FCC is taking with respect to the iPhone and AT&amp;T</a>.</p>

Rather than respond inline, I figured I'd blog it and see if the navel-gazing contagion can't be made to spread further.</p>
<p>First: <a class="reference external" href="http://www.grammarpolice.net">Kriston</a> is <a class="reference external" href="http://attackerman.firedoglake.com/2009/08/17/what-secrets-lurk-within-district-9-white-anxiety/#comment-12619">bothered</a> by the film's formal conceit, or lack thereof:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For structural reasons the film can’t tell us what it wants us to know. They did a bad job deciding about whether it was a compilation of footage or an omniscient film. The move slips at its own convenience between heroic presentation and after-the-fact video artifact, which threatens the integrity of the premise but, much worse, leaves us kind of stranded as viewers. Is this supposed to be a reliable presentation of the facts? Or is it a highly edited, manicured presentation a la Starship Troopers?</p>
<p>[...]Blomkamp has established this narrator through whom all motives must be filtered. Because it isn’t supposed to be a filmed movie in a cinematic sense but an edited compilation of video artifacts. Presumably some post-MNU bureaucracy or media outfit is stitching together all these clips: Perhaps, in light of events and revelations at the end of the film, press were able to acquire access to extraordinary video accounts and so on. I don’t know — it’s really confusing to figure out who’s talking.</p>
<p>The structural aspects notwithstanding (which really ruined the film for me) I thought it was a negative racist message encoded within a positive racial message. As if the film were saying, “Yes, this is a film about positive mutual understanding between black and white Africans. No-no—not Nigerians, no. You know how they are.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm sympathetic to the complaints about the film's structure. At times I found myself wondering what medium I was supposed to imagine myself to be watching. Ultimately, I concluded that the filmmakers had taken the smart way out by simply declining to answer the question. Why make yourself a slave to a form? If the payoff to adhering to documentarian pretense is greater than the payoff of the available dramatic alternatives, fine. But in this case Blomkamp decided it was better to, say, show Wikus hiding in the tall grass, or to frame him with a close-up in the middle of a firefight, than to preserve the fake-documentary format. So that's what Blomkamp did — but, interestingly, he didn't then force himself to surrender the documentary trappings that allowed gigantic hunks of exposition go down (relatively) smoothly. The result doesn't make a lot of formal sense, but I think it's evidence of Blomkamp's properly-set priorities, and is therefore basically fine. There are some movies that are almost exclusively about their form — Blair Witch, Spinal Tap — and for them to step outside of the rules of the game would be disastrous. But this isn't such a film.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The question of the movie's Nigerian thugs is one I feel more sheepish about addressing. But if their inclusion bothers us, I have to wonder what an acceptably enlightened alternate portrayal would have looked like.&nbsp; My guess: pretty lame.</p>
</p><p>No one seems to be questioning the plausibility of a criminal enterprise emerging to prey upon the residents of District 9. So are we bothered by that operation's ethnic uniformity? That doesn't seem right — gangs only tend to be multiethnic melting pots in after-school specials and Jackie Chan movies. Are we bothered by the ruling warlord's embrace of abhorrent, primitive beliefs in the form of Muti rituals? Well, alright, but <a class="reference external" href="http://news.scotsman.com/latestnews/Muti-killing-suspect-deported-to.2380656.jp">Muti is a real thing</a> (click the link, that story's got killing for body parts, identifies Muti as South African, and involves a Nigerian). And of course warlords have adopted <a class="reference external" href="http://www.slate.com/id/2086490/">strange</a> mystical <a class="reference external" href="http://www.time.com/time/asia/magazine/2001/0129/thai.burma.html">beliefs</a> before (and no, by that first link I do not mean to conflate vastly distant and different African cultures within a single, oversimplified continental bin — but the point that bad, ignorant people can subscribe to bad, ignorant religious beliefs shouldn't be particularly controversial).</p>
<p>So, given that the film also features a number of black Africans behaving like normal human beings — though admittedly in this movie that's faint praise; and admittedly they do so without much screen time — I'm not sure how upset we should be at the portrayal of the Nigerian gang in the movie. Certainly I don't agree with Spencer that &quot;you could tell the morality play of District 9 entirely without [the Nigerians]&quot; — they're necessary to make a point about the weak preying on the weaker, and to hold up a mirror to the civilized facade of MNU.</p>
<p>But of course that's all pretty easy for me to say. And all of the preceding assumes that establishing plausibility (relative to the universe of the movie) is the same as a get-out-of-jail-free card.&nbsp; I'm not sure that's right.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The third thing to discuss is Peter's theory, relayed by Spencer, that <em>District 9</em> could represent the dawn of competent videogame filmmaking*; in the same way that the comic book movie crawled from the muck over the past decade, <em>District 9</em> could be the first of a set of movies to successfully translate games to film.</p>
</p><p>I think it's likely that Peter is right about how history will judge the question, but I think that judgment will be unjustified. Games are now an enormous industry, and it's inevitable that their brands will eventually be slapped on some films sufficiently well-made to distract from the fact that the underlying properties are all shameless ripoffs of Tolkien, Aliens and/or Blade Runner. But I think it's basically incoherent to talk about adapting a game for the screen. You might as well talk about adapting a breakfast cereal. Sure, Count Chockula could (and no doubt will) eventually show up at the multiplex. But would that have anything to do with cereal? I don't think it makes sense to approach the question that way.</p>
<p>It'll really just be the games' trappings that are adapted; the movies will have nothing to do with the essential thing that makes a videogame a videogame. Yes, you can buy a disc and put it in your Xbox and interact with it and see a great story (though the odds of this happening are extremely slim). But the &quot;great story&quot; part is really a separate artifact from the interactive component that defines the game. Virtually all genuinely good in-game storytelling happens when the user is bolted to his or her seat, temporarily removed from the decisions or tests of skill that make up the bulk of the entertainment.</p>
<p>Games' settings, characters and plots will be shuttled to the screen — we'll have lame quests, hackneyed sci-fi settings, enchanted swords and cursed hands aplenty. But those things are just window dressing for the actual play mechanic. They could just as easily exist in a comic or a novel or a Saturday morning cartoon. The essential <em>game</em> aspect of the thing won't be translated, except via the occasional ill-advised moment of fanservice (e.g. <em>Doom</em>'s first person camera shots).</p>
<p>I don't think the situation is the same for comic books — partly by convention and partly due to the format, certain types of stories, characters and storytelling techniques lend themselves to that medium. &quot;Comic book movies&quot; is therefore a somewhat more meaningful concept than &quot;videogame movies&quot; is likely to turn out to be. There's just much less overlap between what defines a good game and what defines a good movie than there is between what makes a good comic and what makes a good film. &quot;Lots of dialogue and action&quot; is a more helpful constraint for a creator than &quot;the protagonist needs to be able to recover health at various points in the story for no good reason&quot;.</p>
<p>I say all this as a fan of videogames. But I'm increasingly of the opinion that those looking forward to the dawn of great storytelling in games are kidding themselves. Games tend to tell great stories when they're at their least game-like; and when they do, the parts of the game that linger tend to distract from the narrative experience. Perhaps some day the desire for genuine self-determination can be married to the framework of an expertly-constructed narrative such that user actions can be both meaningful and their consequences dramatically satisfying. But I think that for the foreseeable future, those wishing to square that circle are going to have to stick to drugs and dreams.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the games that can be best turned into movies will be those that are glorified comics with an interface bolted on. Yeah, you can turn that into a movie. But there's no reason to pretend that its status as a game had anything to do with it.</p>
<p><em>* District 9 started out as an adaptation of Halo, but when that project fell apart the director was given free reign to pursue a smaller-budget adventure.&nbsp; What he came up with has a production design that is recognizably descended from the Halo universe, but which shares none of its ponderous, godawful backstory.&nbsp; Fanboys' refusal to acknowledge the incredibly-derivative-yet-also-really-stupid-and-boring nature of the Halo games' setting and story is a persistent source of irritation for me.</em></p>

Well, okay, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ryanavent.com/blog/?p=2201">Ryan doesn't think so</a>.&nbsp; You should go read that post and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/08/07/AR2009080702043.html?hpid=opinionsbox1">the Greg Clark column</a> that prompted this discussion, although I have a feeling I'm about to quote a lot of Ryan's entry:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="docutils container">
Machine and robotic resources aren’t free; they’re resource constrained just like everything else is resource constrained. We have the tecnological know-how to replace millions of human workers with machines <em>right now</em>, but we don’t because the expense of building, programming, operating, and maintaining the machines is too great. It’s not worth it. As demand for human labour falls, the price of human labour will also fall making the hiring of humans more attractive. Meanwhile, as demand for robot labour increases, the price of robot labour will also increase (since the stuff robots are made of is scarce), making the use of a robot for any given task less attractive. There will then be some market equilibrium which will, in all likelihood, involve plenty of employment for low skilled workers.</div>
</blockquote>
<p>This all seems generally correct, but only very generally.&nbsp; It strikes me that the same argument could have been made about the job security of horses at the dawn of the age of the automobile.&nbsp; And sure, there are still plenty of horses around, but I think you'd have to attribute that to a pretty generous horse-subsidization scheme.</p>
<p>Ryan lists a couple of constraints on mechanization:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="docutils container">
One is the analytical constraint — there are some human cognitive and physical processes that we haven’t yet learned to emulated in machines. This will continue to be less binding over time, enabling workers to potentially compete with humans in a steadily broader range of fields.</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Certainly some subset of tasks currently performed by humans will be difficult to automate for a long time yet.&nbsp; But not only will technology improve, as Ryan acknowledges, but we can simply eliminate many tasks that are resistant to automation.&nbsp; A computer can't have a conversation with a person the way that a customer service representative can.&nbsp; But instead of resigning themselves to this fact, businesses have simply moved to eliminate this class of commercial interaction, substituting for it with websites, IVR systems and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.comcast.net">brutal indifference</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="docutils container">
Then there is the energy constraint. Machines require power to operate, and the more machines we build, the more power they’ll need. This constraint might eventually be overcome, but until then energy costs will rise with the machine share of the labour force, helping to keep humans at work.</div>
</blockquote>
<p>I think this is overstated.&nbsp; It's a real issue, sure, but it takes energy to run a clerk, too -- it's just that it has to be slowly collected from the sun over a period of months, then the resulting chemical artifact collected, processed, shipped, stocked, sold and prepared.&nbsp; That cost is going to have to be covered by the clerk's salary, and on a per work-unit basis it's going to be a lot higher than burning coal somewhere and shoving the electrons into a high-tension wire.&nbsp; And this doesn't even account for the fact that our outrageous social norms demand that the business owner pay to power the clerk even when he's not making the firm any money.</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="docutils container">
And then there is the materials constraint. So long as it costs money to build things out of other things, it will be difficult and costly to scale up the machine share of the labour force.</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Raw materials seem to be holding pretty steady -- in the last few years we've seen a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.mongabay.com/images/commodities/charts/chart-index_metals.html">noticeable blip</a> in prices of copper and a few other things, and I admit I don't feel qualified to assess the scare stories about peak chromium/lithium/whatever that arise from time to time. But in general I don't think there's much indication that supplies of automation-enabling materials will limit further mechanization.&nbsp; The raw inputs -- metal, motors, plastics, microchips -- are already produced at enormous scale for many other sectors.&nbsp; If demand for automation products spikes, those resources can probably be reallocated without any enormous price shocks.</p>
<p>Besides, raw materials just don't make up that much of the price tag for this stuff.&nbsp; A large chunk of the cost is the engineering effort that goes into it, which is a knowledge product and therefore not something we can think of as subject to quite the same constraints as physical materials.&nbsp; As patents expire and as modularity and abstraction spread, I think the absolute price of automation technology is likely to continue to drop.&nbsp; You only have to look at the rise of Roomba to see that robots have been getting dramatically cheaper at a rapid clip.&nbsp; Certainly the burden of proof should rest with those who contend otherwise.</p>
<p>The crucial thing to realize about all this is that the less-than-fully-automated status quo is not proof that we've reached an equilibrium.&nbsp; There are cultural hurdles to overcome, for one thing.&nbsp; These days if I order a sandwich at Wawa, I do so through a computerized interface.&nbsp; Could this have been done fifteen years ago? Sure, probably -- maybe not with a fancy touchscreen, but pictographic buttons would've gotten the job done.&nbsp; I don't think that my grandparents' generation would've liked that, though, and I doubt that Wawa wanted to be the first chain to bet on such an approach.</p>
<p>Perhaps more importantly, it's also the case that the size of the total, cross-societal capital investment that we're talking about is pretty large.&nbsp; It seems reasonable to me to expect that it may take businesses decades to finance the purchase of as many robots as they should optimally have.&nbsp; It's a complicated undertaking for a business, and in many cases the specific, non-technological design of the systems is still being worked out.&nbsp; Consider automated parking garages: the necessary technologies -- magstripe cards, vending machines, robotic gates -- have existed for a long time, but the pay-near-the-exit kiosk setup seems to only have emerged in the last decade or two as the best way to organize it all.&nbsp; Or look at McDonald's: they've been experimenting with automation technology for at least a decade, slowly rolling out fry-loading machines and the like.&nbsp; Does anyone doubt that the basic technologies for robotic burger assembly already exist?&nbsp; But the firm's got a profitable business to run, and franchisees are no doubt slow to finance these upgrades; there's no hurry.&nbsp; It took decades to complete the electrification of the country, and its robotification -- which promises gradual economic benefits rather than immediate quality of life improvements -- may take even longer.</p>
<p>Broadly, I'm sure that Ryan's right: there'll be an equilibrium reached at some point.&nbsp; But I don't see much indication that we're there yet, and it seems conceivable that wages for unskilled human labor at that equilibrium point will be below the threshold that's necessary for funding a minimally-acceptable existence (some would argue that this is already the case).&nbsp; I'm no economist, but it seems like weird things are likely to occur as labor costs are converted to capital costs, and an unavoidable shift toward a vast welfare state seems like a totally plausible possibility to me.</p>
<p>The good news is that this can be inferred to be more or less what happened in the world of Star Trek*, and that seems to have worked out okay.</p>
<p>* Though of course our perspective on the matter is distorted by the focus on Starfleet</p>
<p><strong>YOU SAY ARTISTS, I SAY STARFLEET:</strong> Ezra <a class="reference external" href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/ezra-klein/2009/08/dystopia_in_the_outlook_sectio.html">weighs in</a>.&nbsp; Also check the unhyperlinkable comment by &quot;thedavidmo&quot; about how standards of living will be higher in our robot-filled future.&nbsp; Yes!&nbsp; And that's not even counting the benefits to be had by reducing the per capita level of <em>toil</em>.&nbsp; Not that I'll be alive for a revolutionary reduction in necessary work, mind you, but I think there's a decent chance of seeing many businesses move to a 4-day work week, which will leave the total number of hours worked mathematically pristine, but which in practice will mean a whole lot less time spent on (or thinking about) the job.</p>

<p>Most of the accounts of paper mail's decline explain it by pointing to the advantages of electronic communication.&nbsp; And it's true: email and the phone have the edge in terms of both speed and cost.&nbsp; But most commentators ignore one of their biggest advantages, which is that modern communication mediums outperform the mail by <em>not being terrible and useless.</em></p>
<p>It is, I admit, sometimes pleasant to find an envelope whose little tear-off sides hint that a check is waiting.&nbsp; But ignoring that specific case for a moment: what does mail do for me?&nbsp; For the most part, it's nothing more than a string of obligations -- and worse, ones that are hidden within a stream of cynical and dishonest commercial appeals, many of them specifically designed to trick me both by their packaging and their contents (credit monitoring sounds great! and look, the credit card company is sending me checks to use!).</p>
<p>Yet mail can't be ignored, because it's the de facto -- and often de jure -- system for notifying individuals of events that may ultimately have serious legal or financial consequences.&nbsp; If I've been sending an electronic bill payment to the wrong address, or am supposed to report for jury duty, or forgot to sign my tax return, the mail is the only place that I'll hear about it before the cable stops working or a deputy shows up.</p>
<p>But use of the mail for this vital function has been made more difficult at a steady clip as solicitations have become a bigger and bigger portion of each user's daily haul.&nbsp; It's gotten to the point where I almost never receive a replacement credit card the first time it's sent to me.&nbsp; The envelopes that carry such cards are, for obvious reasons, not clearly labeled, and so they wind up torn in half and in the trash.&nbsp; It isn't until I notice an expired card, call the company and make a mental note to start opening envelopes that the situation is resolved.</p>
<p>The reduction of home delivery to five days per week won't change this, of course, but if it represents a step toward the destruction of the mail as our society's official communication medium, I'm all for it.&nbsp; Messages about events that could impact my finances or freedom shouldn't be transmitted via a channel that's mostly filled with advertising.&nbsp; Instead we ought to be using a medium that's legally protected from commercial intrusion -- there are desperately few, but mobile phones come to mind, and cryptographically signed email could work.&nbsp; Really, almost anything would be better than burying important messages amidst advertisements designed to look like important messages.</p>

Besides, one of their developers showed up in comments and stated that they're willing to work with developers via their (not publicly disclosed) API.&nbsp; I've been emailing back and forth with him, and it's clear that they're willing to let people use their data if they enter into royalty agreements.</p>
<p>So I can either duplicate functionality (but try to do things slightly better -- unlikely, given my lack of iPhone development experience) or I could try to anonymously release a free, quick-hit application that undercuts Nextbus's slightly dodgy inclination to charge Metro, then turn around and charge the people who fund Metro.&nbsp; But doing that would certainly violate the license surrounding their data, and they'd get the app pulled and/or break whatever interface I cook up.</p>
<p>At the moment I'm leaning toward collecting data over a set period of time, then analyzing how badly Metro does at arriving at each stop on time.&nbsp; But doing that would require matching GTFS stops to Nextbus stops, which <a class="reference external" href="/2009/07/02/some-nextbus-stats/">isn't easy</a>.</p>
<p>So tell me, Nextbus-iPhone-app-users: is there anything you wish the app did that it doesn't?&nbsp; Or should I content myself with the above-proposed navel-gazing?</p>

<li>How is having a monolithic server installation in a datacenter consistent with avoiding ISP-level blocking by the government? How can this project succeed if the government just decides to block all encrypted traffic?</li>
<li>Why is there no discussion on the <a class="reference external" href="http://haystacknetwork.com/">project website</a> of the technical approach being used? Are the developers familiar with the architecture and history of the <a class="reference external" href="http://freenetproject.org/">Freenet</a> project, or <a class="reference external" href="http://tor.eff.org">Tor</a>? What are their technical credentials, anyway, other than having read the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/">Squid docs</a>?</li>
<li>Why isn't the app open source, or even just released? If the answer is &quot;security through obscurity&quot;, how long do the developers expect that tactic to work?</li>
<li>Why have the organizers been hitting people up for money ever since the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.prnine.com/releases-002834/iran/haystack-developers-announce-successful-test-plants-program-handful-iranians.html">first press release</a>?</li>
<li>And, most pressingly: what could possibly possess someone to unsarcastically describe himself by uttering the phrase, &quot;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.prnine.com/releases-002816/iran/haystack-program-providing-unfiltered-internet-access-iran-released.html">I have always been a man of principle</a>&quot;?</li>

                    <p>Via <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~tblee/">Tim</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/24/business/media/24content.html">here's the AP's new plan</a> for protecting its content from the depredations of those who would seek to promote it. Apparently they'll be adding a &quot;digital wrapper&quot; to each story, which will contain some sort of invisible watermark, or something, and will be able to communicate with the AP's servers in order to track unauthorized use -- including, astoundingly, use that is nothing more than a linked headline. A few points:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">This plan is technologically hopeless.&nbsp; It is essentially an effort to install DRM into plain text.&nbsp; That's impossible.&nbsp; DRM schemes fail even when added to executable, binary file formats that are read by systems under the control of the content publisher.&nbsp; Neither of those conditions apply here, nor will they, unless the AP attempts to eschew the web browser entirely.&nbsp; Presumably they're counting on some Javascript to phone home.&nbsp; That'll work fine for AP member sites, but it will not survive the copy-and-pasted trip into a HuffPo blockquote.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">This plan is dishonest.&nbsp; It's interesting that the AP thinks its headlines contain so much unique value that they deserve protection -- very interesting indeed, given that member organizations habitually rewrite those headlines (without penalty from the AP, of course).</p>
</li>
<li><div class="first line-block">
<div class="line">Even if the plan could work, it wouldn't work the way they seem to think.&nbsp; From the article:</div>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>“If someone can build multibillion-dollar businesses out of keywords, we can build multihundred-million businesses out of headlines, and we’re going to do that,” Mr. Curley said. The goal, he said, was not to have less use of the news articles, but to be paid for any use.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Similarly, if a lemonade stand starts charging $1000 per glass, their intent is probably not to reduce lemonade purchases. It's simply to create an industry-sustaining level of revenue. And who can argue with that?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It's really kind of astounding.&nbsp; I can't claim to know much about econ -- once I figured out that &quot;where the lines cross&quot; was the answer to every exam question in 101, I pretty much tuned out -- but the realities of the situation should be apparent to anyone who's thought about these questions for even a moment.</p>
<p><strong>CLARITY!:</strong> Also via Tim, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ap.org/media/images/APnewsregistry.jpg">a diagram of how the scheme will work</a>.&nbsp; I was wrong!&nbsp; All this talk about &quot;sending signals back&quot; pointed toward Javascript, but that &quot;hNews format&quot; label gives the game away: they're going to use <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microformat#Specific_microformats">microformats</a>.&nbsp; Microformats are a beautifully simple idea: adding meaningful data to HTML markup in the form of specific class tags. They were big with the semantic web crowd before they got confused and started spending all their time reinventing XML and relational database technology.</p>
<p>Microformats won't actively cause signals to be sent back, but the AP can run a spider to look for instances of them.&nbsp; And the information might survive a copy and paste! If the copier doesn't paste into Notepad in between! And they don't block the AP spider!</p>
<p>So yeah, it's still hopeless.&nbsp; These guys need to start lobbying for substantial expansions of copyright law -- that's the only way I can see this working.&nbsp; Or maybe they'll put clickwrap licenses around every AP news site that mandate preservation of the microformat data in all subsequent use.&nbsp; Either way it'd prompt a very interesting legal fight.</p>

This is all to the good — the more the blogosphere resembles drunken bullshitting, the happier I am. yet this approach carries problems. The quality and quantity of hip hop feuds is erratic; we can't count on them to provide a reliable source of rhetorical inspiration. Recognizing this problem, let me humbly suggest a stupider alternative.</p>
<p>You guys should start watching more professional wrestling. Hear me out.</p>
<p>At this point, hip hop beefs are clearly artifice — in fact it seems strange to recall that this wasn't always obvious. The transparent motivation for this feud, and most, is to increase the relevance of a lesser player like The Game. And this is for the best: like punk rock and heavy metal before it, hip hop seems to have realized that a musical genre can celebrate brutality or authenticity, but not both — not if it wants to be a successful enterprise rather than just self-annihilating performance art. Yet despite this unavoidable choice, the realities of the genre's history and the demands of its fanbase make a definitive choice between these alternatives impossible.</p>
<p>This merely-half-hearted embrace of fakery places limits on the flamboyance of any conflict. What's the root of this current beef? The Game insulting Jay-Z's wife? By any theatrical standard that's a pretty weak source of motivation. Yet because of the pretense that it was real, even this mild offense was considered by hip hop observers to be beyond the pale.</p>
<p>Professional wrestling does not submit to such arbitrary narrative restrictions. There, the feuds are rooted in more satisfyingly concrete disagreements. Like when Kurt Angle became upset because Stone Cold Steve Austin had sprayed him with a beer truck's high-pressure discharge hose. Or when the Big Bossman, for reasons known only to him, interrupted The Big Show's father's funeral by chaining the coffin to the back of his patrol car and driving haphazardly across the graveyard in which the funeral party had assembled. Or when Triple H drugged and kidnapped his boss's daughter in order to marry her against her will in Las Vegas (an admittedly troubling arrangement that, feminists will be glad to know, was ultimately vindicated when Stephanie McMahon renounced her ties to her father and asserted her retroactive consent).</p>
<p>I know what you're thinking: there is no parallel here. None of this has anything to do with feuding rappers. I appreciate that the shift in dramatic scale is somewhat jarring, but I think there are real parallels. In both industries, charisma and braggadocio provide a more compelling set of attributes that supplement a skill-set that is frequently only of nominal importance (wrestling ability; verbal skills). Conflicts are typically resolved through a strangely constrained vocabulary (wrestling moves; assertions about how much cocaine each speaker has sold). Departures from these vocabularies can prompt the audience to dismiss the formal relevance of the associated actions (belts do not change hands if you are only able to pin your opponent after hitting him with a sledge hammer; sales and critical acclaim are often dismissed with appeals to authenticity). Both mediums sustain their vitality through a sort of &quot;farm system&quot; that suffers from fewer commercial constraints (regional promotions; mix tapes). Supporting groups are formed around stars to promote new or marginal talent. The approbation of the fanbase is the ultimate source of political capital, although the development of strategic business relationships allows each industry's top players to semi-permanently cement their positions as kingmakers. Hell, both industries have even got a guy called <a class="reference external" href="http://www.hhhthegame.com/">The Game</a>.</p>
<p>So take some time. Consider my proposal. Read up on <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Def_jam_vendetta">Def Jam: Vendetta</a>, which is something like a Grand Unified Field Theory for the preceding post. And recognize that there's no reason to resist the narrative ridiculousness that you truly crave. You don't have to settle for half-assed efforts at thug life improv. Embrace the authentically inauthentic.</p>

                    <p>I'm at the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.dccourts.gov/dccourts/about/general.jsp">Moultrie Courthouse</a> today, fulfilling my civic duty. It's not too bad. So far I'd say the experience is somewhat more entertaining than <a class="reference external" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113500/">Jury Duty</a> (starring Pauly Shore), but probably somewhat less entertaining than <a class="reference external" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0993818/fullcredits#cast">&quot;Jury Duty&quot;</a>, an apparently still-running series in which luminaries liek Bruce Vilanch, Kevin Sorbo and Vanessa from <em>The Cosby Show</em> sit in judgment of ordinary Americans.</p>
<p>The worst part about all this is the lack of novelty: the DC internet community has been decimated by a wave of jury summonses over the past few months, totally undermining the anecdotal value of this experience. On the other hand, it's not like there's a ton of things to do as I sit here, waiting to be told to go sit somewhere else. Hence this blog post.</p>
<p>I was called into voire dire for a murder trial in a courtroom that had seemingly been designed by the same firm that built our nation's system of bowling alleys (it will apparently soon be renovated to look more like a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.gruzensamton.com/pop_project_all.asp?BuildingCode=&amp;image=1&amp;id=138#">cheesy starship set</a>). Things went pretty smoothly: I even managed not to crack up when the judge claimed that the crime occurred in a neighborhood called &quot;Turkeyneck&quot;.</p>
<p>I wasn't removed during the initial round of juror elimination. I think I have to attribute this to my corduroy jacket: to prosecutors a jacket says that I'm rich enough to have no way to relate to the probably-poor defendant, while the defense sees its waling and immediately knows I'm beset by liberal guilt.</p>
<p>My obvious desirability as a juror (says the 29 year-old with the Xbox Live account) had me a little worried, in fact. I politely explained to the judge that actually I'd rather not spend all next week away from email and/or dealing with weighty moral issues; amazingly, he actually acceded, putting me near the bottom of the line of folks that gradually snaked its way into the jury box. And, sure enough, the court managed to find a full allotment of dutiful citizens/suckers before I was needed.</p>
<p>I'm back in the jurors' lounge now, and my name has already been called again, but there's apparently some question as to whether I'll be needed. I certainly wouldn't mind being excused: I'm a little wiped out. Having been informed by others that the courthouse had wifi, I'd sort of assumed that coffee would also be available — that's how Maslow's Hierarchy of White Collar Needs works, isn't it? Sadly, this has not proven to be the case, and the other caffeine I've got in me came from some weak lunchtime tea at Chinatown Express. Here's hoping I get to go home soon, or at least that the next trial is about something sufficiently unimportant that my sleepy incompetence will be forgivable.</p>

Last night I found myself shopping for a &quot;dear Grandpa, sorry your three-legged cat got torn apart by stray dogs&quot; card (yes, really — I had to settle for &quot;condolences on the loss of your pet&quot;, which could be talking about anybody but will have to do). But in the midst of perusing the card aisle I came across a sizable selection of HomeGoing cards (they even had their own separate section in the card aisle). A little investigation shows that these are condolence cards, and it doesn't take a genius to figure out that the term is meant to imply that the deceased has gone to heaven. But I had never heard the word HomeGoing before.</p>
<p>The internet doesn't have much to say about it, either. Wikipedia just turns up references to individuals' HomeGoings, and the top google hit is a press release from a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2006/02/20060207.html">disreputable rightwing media outlet</a>. That's not much to go on.</p>
<p>So is this something new? Is it yet another way for evangelical Christians to turn half of America into a secret society that can snicker at us until Rapture O'Clock? Is this some repopularized archaic term that I've simply never heard of, but which has a long and appropriately humorless Protestant history? Or has (Hall)market research simply shown that people buying cards about death don't like to think about death? Right now I'm leaning toward the first or third explanations — &quot;HomeGoing&quot; sounds a little too much like a made-up religious observance from <em>Battlestar Galactica</em> for me to think that Pilgrims came up with it. But for all I know it might actually be funereal cosplay: I didn't check inside any of the cards for references to the Lords of Kobol, but I wouldn't be surprised to find them.</p>

                    <p>A promise is a promise, even if no one particularly cares. Here's that DHTML similarity matrix <a class="reference external" href="/2007/03/02/keeping-promises/">I promised</a>. I haven't done much cross-browser testing, but in Firefox at least you should now be able to see which state delegation are the most homogenous* and which are the most loyal to their party. The results won't shock you (Californians are better Democrats than Kansans!?!!), but it's nice to see that my math seems to be correct.</p>
<p>Now that I'm home (and Southby preparations are over with) I can devote some more time to this Sunlight Foundation contest. I've got a few ideas and a bunch of very good leads courtesy of <a class="reference external" href="http://bayes.wordpress.com/">son1</a>. The deadline isn't until mid-April — I think I should definitely be able to come up with something cool by then.</p>

<p>* Yes, I know that I misspelled &quot;homogeneous&quot;. I just feel very strongly that it ought to be spelled &quot;homogenous&quot;. Milk isn't homogenie-ized, is it? Yeah, that's what I thought. WHAT!</p>

Given that this isn't the final form that this data will be visualized in, I don't think I'm going to bother fixing it. It still works on the <a class="reference external" href="/2007/03/14/similarity-matrix-2/">permalinked page</a> though, so if you want to see it in action follow that link.</p>

                    <p>I wouldn't normally beat a dead horse like this, but this is not only a subhead, but from the same issue as the <a class="reference external" href="/2007/01/18/get-got/">last quote I bitched about</a> (the issue's been lying around the office, and I've been slowly flipping through it). The prominence of this apparent typo is giving me pause, making me wonder if either a) I'm badly confused about the proper use of the verb &quot;got&quot;; or b) this reflects some new and wholly intentional editorial policy at Time. Anyway: huh.</p>
