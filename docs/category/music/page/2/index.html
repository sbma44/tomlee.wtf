                    <p>A few weeks ago <a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/sasara">Sara</a> mentioned to me that she was enjoying a band called Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros. I would've been sold on the strength of the name alone; a friend's recommendation was more than enough to make me resolve to give them a listen.</p>
<p>It took me a couple of weeks, though (and an additional tweet from <a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/mstem">Matt</a>) before I got around to it. To be honest, I'm not sure I'm a fan of the album. I find large parts of it to be a bit boring; other parts remind me -- for reasons I can't quite identify -- of the sort of bloated, Fleetwood-Mac-ian WASH-FM rock that echoes off receptionist desks all over this town.</p>
<p>But &quot;Home&quot; -- goddamn, what a song.</p>
<blockquote>
<a class="reference external" href="/mp3/Edward%20Sharpe%20and%20the%20Magnetic%20Zeros%20-%20Home.mp3">Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros – Home</a></blockquote>
<p>There are a lot of things to like about it. I could've been counted as a fan on the basis of the Morricone-isms alone. And I'm a complete sucker for the female vocal, which has the sort of breathy, stretching-after-a-nap timbre that only happens when a really cute girl picks up a serious cigarette habit.</p>
<p>But more than that, it's an amazing recorded performance between the two singers, one that evokes a genre tradition but invigorates it with a sense of utter, honest vulnerability. I haven't heard anything like it in a while.</p>
<p>If someone stuck you in a studio, said &quot;We're rolling, <em>try to sound in love</em>&quot;, could you do it this well? I'm left completely charmed, slightly wary, and unsure whether to believe in the singers' talents or (god) their love. I may vaguely hate them for making me write that sentence, but I can't deny that the sound they make together is miraculous.</p>

                    <p>I am, let's face it, a bit too well-hydrated to pretend any semblance of rhetorical structure. So let's just do this in context-free bullet point format, like the rest of our society:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Indie rock beards: done. If I, on the cusp of my fourth decade, can see this, then surely the matter was actually settled in some Pitchfork staff listserv months ago. Capps has already accidentally stumbled into the vanguard. And now, in the blinding, beard-free light of day, it's obvious that this was just a conceptual hangover from the Year of Earnest Music Composed in Cabins. But now it's finished, and those of us with beard disabilities can rejoice. Temporarily, anyway — for razors cost money, and the unhygienic laziness of musicians is not to be underestimated.</li>
<li>Harlem Shakes played a largely acoustic set, and mentioned offhandedly that they'd &quot;lost&quot; some equipment, conveying the impression that as consummate professionals they had recovered from larcenous adversity by composing off-the-cuff acoustic arrangements. The rock flute was deployed! And then the rock sax! And then the last two songs suddenly featured a drum kit and bass and electric six string, so, um, what?</li>
<li>They're doomed anyway. Harlem Shakes is a very good band, but their timing is all wrong. If they were eighteen months out from the last time David Byrne or Clap Your Hands did something? Sure, everyone would recognize that these guys are excellent musicians who make inspiring music. But they aren't, so they won't. Amanda and Catherine are probably right that the next album will settle things, but at the moment, critics' self-satisfaction at their ability to name the group's influences is dooming the band.</li>
<li>We — you and I — are never going to escape this musical moment. These fucking synths — these goddamn waxy, Miami-fucking-Vice synths... Stick them alongside modern percussive artillery and our entire generation (+/-1) is powerless to resist. MGMT, Justice, Phoenix — all are trading on this unfortunate artifact of our upbringing. No doubt it will repeat, too, as the tautologically corny soundtracks of future generations' childhoods are resuscitated by the bass-heavy trend of the moment, and that same stupid retro timbre will spawn era after era of not-quite-dance tracks waiting to be remixed into club smashes. There's no question that Passion Pit is writing itself into this history. But they do, occasionally, lean over the edge of it. And maybe I'm just a sucker for this — actually, I <em>know</em> I'm a sucker for this, for any hint of rock and roll catharsis, for just the sound of human voices reaching — but yeah, Passion Pit are capable of pushing beyond the easy rut they've inherited. They didn't care to do it often enough to make me stay for the encore, though.</li>
</ul>
<p>But still: I enjoyed the show. Maybe I'm just getting old; these days it just needs to be loud, the people on stage just need to be feeling something. That's all it takes. Let's hear it for making a terrific racket.</p>

                    <p>Like <a class="reference external" href="http://blogstretch.blogspot.com/2009/04/well.html">Amanda said</a>, the Harlem Shakes show is unfortunately cancelled. That's too bad; I sent the band an email saying I hoped to have a chance to see them soon, and a note to DC9 saying I hoped to see my money again, ever. To date, both remain unanswered.</p>
<p>I think this tips the karmic scales in favor of sharing an MP3, don't you? So here, have a listen to &quot;Strictly Game&quot;. This may not be the best track for hooking people — &quot;<a class="reference external" href="http://hypem.com/search/harlem+shakes+sunlight/1/">Sunlight</a>&quot; is pretty clearly the catchiest, danciest thing on the record — but it's the track I'm currently most enamored with. But hey, they're all pretty good — the title track's the only one I'm lukewarm on.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>And don't miss Amanda's concert-grief-counseling strategy — that Pomegranates track she posted is awfully good, even if naming your band after the world's most overhyped fruit is practically begging for dismissive reviews.</p>

                    <p>As long as I'm going on about music, I may as well recommend the new Harlem Shakes record. I agree with everyone about the new Yeah Yeah Yeahs, and <em>Bromst</em> will certainly be one of the records I remember from 2009, but right now <em>Technicolor Health</em> is dominating my playlist.</p>
<p>I'll refrain from trying to review the damn thing myself and instead point you toward <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cokemachineglow.com/record_review/4389/harlemshakes-technicolorhealth-2009">this writeup</a>, several paragraphs of which I heartily endorse despite its basically missing the point:</p>
<blockquote>
Technicolor Health is some sick candy: itâ€™s what our indie pop should sound like in 2009. It imagines a world where The OC still matters, where goddamned Kanye West is agreeably employed, and where your little brother doesnâ€™t think itâ€™s just ok to listen to Neutral Milk Hotel that many times/isnâ€™t aware of more than half of the bands the Shakes are copping freely when theyâ€™re not just writing sad songs about girls, which is a lot. This is indie pop. This is your lousy local band carried forward starship-like into a fizzing pop nebula and left to spin so fast and so ably that you ultimately forget the baggage and any corny adage; because Technicolor Health fundamentally sounds good and because its songs are well-crafted enough to make a lot of the African drumming and horns sound less like garnish and more like some well-earned reward for writing songs strong enough to make that shit sound sort of necessary. Technicolor Health is self-sufficient. It isnâ€™t community, it eats itself. It is every good-to-great pre-Wincing the Night Away (2007) indie pop record brought forth and actualised as the definitive good-to-great (but mostly great) indie pop record you should be hearing as spring turns into summer, 2009. The Harlem Shakes wear everybodyâ€™s clothes really well.</blockquote>
<p>The writer seems perturbed, but I don't know why. This is what's great about pop music — about really good pop music — <em>it will fool you every time</em>. Don't be upset or confused; this is its gift, and it would be boorish to question it. If they're doing it right, that fresh-faced young band will always sound new, they will always make your foot tap, they will always make you feel like you're soaring. Leave genealogy to the Mormons. You're wired for this shit. It doesn't have to be new, it just has to be great.</p>

                    <p>The <a class="reference external" href="http://stereogum.com/archives/mp3/new-thermals-now-we-can-see_051801.html">first (intentionally) leaked track</a> got me pretty excited about the new Thermals album. Now the rest of the album has made its way onto the internet, and after spending some time with it... I donno, guys. I won't claim to be the world's greatest Thermalsologist, but I really liked the last album. Unfortunately, it turns out that if you remove the anger and urgency from their music, you're left with plodding melodies and lyrics that are occasionally pretty lame (the first verse on the album certainly doesn't get things off to a very good start).</p>
<p>But I'm still looking forward to their May show at the Black Cat. Here's hoping they decide to play all their new stuff twice as fast as they recorded it — that could go a long way toward improving things.</p>

                    <p>The fact that the Wombats haven't yet become a hugely successful band is a persistent puzzlement for me. I've been patient! Ever since the first version of &quot;Backfire at the Disco&quot; I've bided my time, waiting for stateside tour dates and a favorable Pitchfork review. I thought that a much-touted SXSW showcase would do it, but no — I'm still waiting. In the meantime the band has released a number of increasingly overproduced (but still catchy!) singles, and seems to be prepping a new LP.</p>
<p>They also signed with Roadrunner Records, whose <a class="reference external" href="http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/artists/">artists page</a> is hilarious enough that you really ought to visit it. It's filled with doughy, dour-looking gentleman who front bands with names like Dragonforce and DevilDriver and Nickelback, and who never, ever smile. It is probably the worst collection of bands you've ever seen — except for that one trio of little British fellas, who write catchy pop songs that are smart and fun and pretty much everything you'd want from a cheeky Liverpudlian trio. Bah! Anyway, if you can find <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Girls-Boys-Marsupials-Wombats/dp/B000GMBQ5U/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&amp;s=music&amp;qid=1235160247&amp;sr=8-5">this album</a> at a non-exorbitant price, you should really think about getting it.</p>

Remember how I <a class="reference external" href="/2008/12/16/music-in-the-year-of-the-rat/">bitched about 2008's crop of music</a>? And how I closed by saying &quot;but there are a bunch of things I haven't listened to; maybe they'll be better&quot;? Well, I listened to a few of them, and they've all been fantastic. Here are some albums I should've paid attention to earlier, and a few that I've been paying attention to recently:</p>
<p>No Age (too cool for skool, but in a pleasant way); Glasvegas (awesomely overwhelming, and prompted me to finally listen to <em>Lust Lust Lust</em> for a full-on fuzz-fest); Gaslight Anthem (actually as good as Spencer says); Titus Andronicus (wears thin by the end, but awfully energetic). And as I mentioned, the new Dan Deacon has leaked and is fantastic — better than <em>Spiderman of the Rings</em>, I think. Although I should preface this observation by noting that my knowledge of classical music is more or less limited to the soundtrack for Beef Council commercials, I will go so far as to say that <em>Bromst</em> sounds Coplandesque to me in a lot of places.</p>
<p>Oh! Also, Julian says that Pains of Being Pure at Heart are good, and the couple of songs I heard at his place bore that judgment out.</p>
<p>Not recommended: Andrew Bird, Animal Collective. Neither are bad (although Bird's a bit boring, which is disappointing given how wowed I've been by the handful of live TV performances of his that I've seen), but neither really did it for me, either. Admittedly, my lukewarm feelings for the AC album may have something to do with the displaced rage that its title elicits.</p>
<p><strong>OH YEAH:</strong> Speaking of music, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/148739-guest-list-diplo">this Diplo interview</a> is pretty funny.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>I was going to write a post complaining about 2008's crop of music, but after reviewing a few more year end lists in addition to the first two that prompted my ire (Rolling Stone, NPR) it's clear that I was just listening to the wrong things.</p>
<p>It's not entirely my fault — people were getting excited about some pretty boring stuff. I wasted a lot of time on new acts that focused on nostalgic sounds, folksiness or acoustic arrangements. That's fine — the world needs a way to fill its Starbucks compilation CDs, after all. But I'm only interested in that stuff in small doses, and this year offered a surplus that was so vast as to be off-putting: Bon Iver, The Dodos, She &amp; Him, The Ting Tings, Vampire Weekend and Fleet Foxes were inescapable. It would be naive to pretend that bands can or should avoid being informed by the past, but many of these acts wore their influences (e.g. Paul Simon, the guy who invented reverb) on their sleeves a bit too prominently for my taste. And the rest were just flat-out wussy. I prefer music that makes me feel young, especially now that I'm not anymore.</p>
<p>Other, more established acts released albums that were pretty okay, but less than mindblowing. The Hold Steady treaded water entertainingly; Mates of State inched forward rather than blasting upward; Wolf Parade finally reemerged but failed to match their debut; and Kanye made a great album that no one would be calling great if it were by, say, Imogen Heap. Also the Killers, Death Cab and Coldplay all released albums that I'm told are pretty good, but which I'm content to ignore until their component tracks show up in Rock Band.</p>
<p>There were two albums that both made it to my iPod and seemed to actually possess some vitality: the ones from Girl Talk and Lil Wayne. Not coincidentally, both underscored how doomed the old recording industry system is. On the one hand you've got Gregg Gillis, whose work is fresh, engaging, and commercially unreleasable thanks to our intellectual property regime. On the other you've got an album that frankly seems just okay*, but which was seized upon in order to anoint a deserving new talent who'd done his reputation-making work on mixtapes and other artists' releases — although admittedly a huge commercial success, Tha Carter III was a rallying point as much as it was a collection of songs.</p>
<p>Anyway, I've now got a formidable list of 2008 albums to acquire: Titus Andronicus, Frightened Rabbit, TV On The Radio, Deerhunter, the Walkmen (sorry <a class="reference external" href="http://blogstretch.blogspot.com">Amanda</a>) and Gaslight Anthem (sorry <a class="reference external" href="http://attackerman.firedoglake.com">Spencer</a>). That's a lot of music to get through before the new year, but I'm optimistic that the exercise will leave me feeling cheerier about 2008 and the musical downturn that'll inevitably be brought on by the coming Democratic administration (less suffering means worse art, or so the theory goes).</p>
<p>* I won't pretend that I know much about hip hop, but I find it hard to believe that anyone can make it all the way through &quot;A Milli&quot; when wearing headphones. On the other hand, the parts of &quot;Lollipop&quot; that aren't stupid are genius.</p>

                    <p>Go read <a class="reference external" href="http://dcist.com/2008/11/12/mates_of_state_black_cat.php">Dave's review</a>, which is both smarter and more measured that I ever could have managed — I'm just so goddamn in the tank for this band.</p>
<p>In particular, Dave's point about the new material is well-taken. After the precision pop machinery of <em>Bring It Back</em>, the new album left me disappointed. But live — faced with singing, emoting human beings — the relatively nuanced piano compositions of <em>Re-arrange Us</em> are ultimately more gratifying, if less immediately, dizzyingly dopamine-pumping<sup>1</sup>. Dave's absolutely right when he says that this is a band that's still getting better.</p>
<p>Which isn't to say that they aren't already really good. This was the first time I've managed to see MoS, and I was surprised by how closely the live arrangements matched those on their records — I'd just sort of assumed that the magic of overdubs played a big role in the albums' appeal. Not so. Their high-register stuff doesn't hit as reliably as it does on the records, but then you wouldn't expect it to. In general their records seem to be a fair representation of the noises they make live.</p>
<p>One thing Dave said that I will quibble with: I really liked their version of &quot;Something&quot;. Sure, it sounded out of place in the set. But in a good way — it sounded casual. I may be wrong — maybe they've toiled over that cover — but the impression conveyed was that you could take pretty much any classic song, feed it into the MoS machine and have it come out harmonized and singable and keyboarded-up. It makes you think that everything they touch turns to pop (not to say the Beatles aren't pop, but you know what I mean). It allowed me separate their sound from their songwriting, which made their musicianship seem all the more impressive.</p>
<p>But like I said, you shouldn't listen to me: I'm just a hopeless fanboy.</p>
<p><sup>1</sup>To be fair, the poppier numbers weren't helped by the fact that the sound at the Cat, while perfectly good and perfectly audible, was turned down to a relatively humane level — comfortable, sure, but there really should've been no escape from that keyboard tone.</p>

                    <p>Looks like <a class="reference external" href="http://www.muxtape.com/">the labels went after Muxtape</a> faster than <a class="reference external" href="/2008/03/27/muxtape-unraveled/">I'd expected</a>. Relaunching as a direct competitor to MySpace's music player functionality strikes me as a smart move — the fidelity offered by MySpace is pretty terrible, and bands are willing to spend a few bucks, I think, for better promotional tools. There are plenty other services out there that scratch this itch, but most haven't got the brand cachet or design sense of Muxtape. I think this could turn into a nice little business for Justin, the site's creator.</p>
<p>On a side note, reading about the licensing challenges faced by Justin should underscore the impressiveness of the <a class="reference external" href="http://hypem.com">Hype Machine</a>'s continued existence. I don't know the details of whatever arrangement Anthony worked out, but he obviously did it a while ago, when the labels were presumably less resigned to the importance of the internet. The Muxtape saga shows that threading this particular needle is still a difficult task; it must have been nearly impossible when HypeM did it.</p>

                    <p>It's been a while, and so a backlog of musical tidbits has been gathering at the top of my spine, periodically releasing pleasant shivering waves. I've been enjoying listening to some things, in other words. Hey, let's direct some of that energy at the internet!</p>
<p>The song from the new iPod commercial will give you cavities, but you're not fooling anyone by pretending you don't have it stuck in your head:</p>
<p>Al3x <a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/al3x/statuses/894880232">tweeted this</a> a while ago, and I've been meaning to pass it along: a Beach Boys mashup that adds yet another layer of harmony — or maybe shifts everything into a different key and uses the original melody as the harmony? Whatever's going on here, it's clear that it's beyond my pretending-to-know-about-music comfort zone. One thing I can say with confidence is that the process strips away the cheery, brave face covering the song's subtle plaintiveness. It also goes THUMP THUMP THUMP, which I find less exciting. But the net effect is pleasing.</p>

<p>Friday's Penny Arcade unveiled a world of amazingly competent videogame rock. Things have come a long way in the past few years — it's no longer enough to just channel 8-bit nostalgia through a six string (although that remains pretty fun, too). Most impressive are <a class="reference external" href="http://www.protomen.com/">The Protomen</a>, who seem to be in the business of recording Thermalsish epics about Megaman. Check out the flash video at their site. Things don't really get going until past the second voiceover, but after that point they get better and better. There's also <a class="reference external" href="http://www.protomen.com/Breaking%20Out/">this</a>, their newest track, an unholy mix of Springsteen &amp; Styx which actually works out quite well.</p>
<p>Also linked from that post: <a class="reference external" href="http://www.myspace.com/manfactory">Man Factory's concept album about Street Fighter 2</a> (available as a free download). It's somewhat hit or miss, but the slow jam about Balrog is definitely worth your attention (as are the titles of all the tracks).</p>
<p>Talking about this stuff prompted Chris to send me <a class="reference external" href="http://zebox.com/projectx/music/">a link</a> to a project of a friend of his: remixed Megaman 2 themes. I haven't listened to them all yet, but Chris is right when he says that the Amen break-laden Airman track is solid.</p>
<p>Finally, it's been a while since I've engaged in any Wrens advocacy. I understand that some of you are doubters. However, I also understand that a number of you are having emotional crises about getting older. Hey, me too! I've been at it since I was about 16, in fact. If you're new to this you may not have noticed just how amazing <em>The Meadowlands</em> is when you first listened to it. The first five songs are the strongest block of album-openers I can think of — <a class="reference external" href="http://songza.com/sbma44">go listen to them</a>. I've been revisiting <em>Meadowlands</em> after spending the past year or two with <em>Secaucus</em>, and it's just as good as I remembered.</p>

<p>The early signs at last night's Hold Steady show were not good. A group of fans had shown up wearing &quot;Unified Scene Drinking Team&quot; softball shirts. And while I couldn't say exactly what Craig Finn had in mind when he invented the first half of that phrase, I was pretty sure it didn't involve flipcup.</p>
<p>The opening act compounded the problem. Homogenous pop/punk with a Bosstones scream — they weren't my thing, really, although a lot of the crowd liked them. Tuning out early gave me plenty of time to think about why the Hold Steady had given them an opening slot. I concluded that it wasn't the band, it was the idea of the band — they were joyful and enthusiastic. And visually, they covered all the bases: there were a couple of tattooed rap/rock fireplugs, an asymptotically skinny indie boy, a nerd-rock drummer peering through dirty hair and ludicrous glasses, and a little keyboard-playing white girl in a pretty Motown dress. My friend Chris summed it up well when he said they looked like a rock band from The Sims.</p>
<p>Which left me in an awkward position. As much as anything the Hold Steady have built themselves on a downright mythic idea of rock and roll and the people that listen to it. I can't say I've ever been a part of a scene like that, but it always sounded pretty good to me. Now I was standing there, staring at what I could only take to be a living shorthand for what they'd had in mind, and it was a cartoon. Suddenly I was in a crowd of fellow fucking tourists, wondering if I'd be wearing a softball jersey, too, if I'd been born into the wrong online neighborhood.</p>
<p>But then the band took to the stage and I realized what you probably already have: this is all ridiculous. Their stories are too good, the music's too good, to get tangled up in worry over authenticity. By the end of the first song Craig Finn had made us toast Joe Strummer, and I found I didn't even care if, for the people around me, the honoree wasn't any more real than Charlemagne or Holly. Their hands stayed up after the toast, and that turned out to be the important thing.</p>

<p>The show wasn't recorded, but the band did a set from this tour on World Cafe, and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.captainsdead.com/2008/06/23/sometimes-she-partied-with-townies/">you can listen to or download it here</a>.

I have the windows open, the better part of a pot of good coffee ahead of me, and I'm listening to music that's both aggressive and aggressively poppy at a pretty significant volume.

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>I am on the record as being anti-Phil Collins. This puts me at odds with some good friends who have jumped wholeheartedly into the half-serious Collins renaissance that's been plaguing our great land as of late. Frankly, I'm surprised it's got legs given its likely provenance, which seems to me to clearly involve <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto:_Vice_City_soundtrack">Grand Theft Auto: Vice City</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/Radio_Episode.aspx?episode=339">This American Life</a> and/or a need to sidestep mainstream America's rededication to all things Journey. The <a class="reference external" href="http://stuffwhitepeoplelike.com/">SWPL</a>ishness of the situation is so glaring as to be embarrassing.</p>
<p>But it's not just this specific musical throwback that worries me. Even though I enjoyed Yglesias's 90s alt-rock party, I have to admit that the theme made me uneasy. I believe that as we get older the first muscles to lose tone are the ones that, when tightly clenched, produce a convincing sense of irony. Sure, listening to Silverchair might seem like a great idea <em>now</em>. But if you aren't careful, before you know it you'll be no different than your uncle who paid $120 for an obstructed view at an Eagles concert that starts at 5pm.</p>
<p>I'll admit that the alternatives are grim. But I think there's at least somewhat more dignity to be had by clinging tightly to Pitchfork's Best New Music section and copies of Paste until the whole enterprise buckles and collapses under the weight of your teenage offspring's embarrassed disavowals. Nostalgia is best left to people who've given up or are too young to have been there in the first place.</p>
<p>But I know that most people don't find this very convincing. So let me try another tack: this past weekend Emily, Scooter, Lauren, Sommer, Jeff and I were at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.philadelphiaweekly.com/view.php?id=9329">a bar</a> in Philly — one of the few where you can still smoke, and therefore one that is certifiably cool. We headed upstairs, where we found a table and some DJs. These guys seemed authentically hip: sporting horrible beards and wraithlike t-shirts, they looked like emaciated bears that had staggered out of the woods and into a Salvation Army, where they constructed poor disguises before setting off to South Philly in search of PBR specials and/or salmon. It should have been a pretty good set, in other words.</p>
<p>Instead? Marcy Playground. Excusable, perhaps, for novelty value (which for some reason seems to be synonymous with &quot;totally monotonous and unbearable&quot;). But then they followed it up with Verve Pipe's &quot;<a class="reference external" href="http://hypem.com/track/541481/Various+Artists-The+Verve+Pipe+-+The+Freshmen">The Freshman</a>&quot; and I knew we were doomed. The biggest hits from the darkest days of the 90s continued to issue from the speakers at an uncomfortable volume (to replicate the effect, turn your radio up and tune it to DC101).</p>
<p>Emily eventually saved us and, pouring on the charm, got them to turn down that dag-blasted racket — we were the only patrons in the room, so it seemed okay to ask. Despite our miraculous escape, the lesson should be clear: ironic musical nostalgia is too dangerous a force to be trusted to civilians. It can go so horribly, horribly wrong.</p>
<p>But I understand the impulse. Maybe it's inescapable. For example, I can't help but regard this as being among the most awesomely moody things I've ever seen:</p>
<p>And no, I can't tell if I mean that ironically.</p>

                    <p>On Saturday night Emily, Charles, Kriston, Becks and I staked out a table at Temperance Hall. And, while engaged in the larger project of noticing how much I like the bar's jukebox, I was reminded how <a class="reference external" href="http://www.zunta.org/blog/archives/2006/04/13/wolf_parade_bla/">god-damned great</a> Wolf Parade is.</p>
<p>Or how great they were, anyway. It's been a while since that album came out. In between then and now most of the attention directed to Wolf Parade has been transferred to Sunset Rubdown, the incredibly self-indulgent side project masterminded by Spencer Krug, one of the band's two founders. I did not approve.</p>
<p>WP is getting ready to finally release a new album (due to what I can only assume is a hilarious swapped-briefcase incident with the folks who run <a class="reference external" href="http://www.pancakemountain.com/">Pancake Mountain</a>, it's called <em>At Mount Zoomer</em>). And, as these things must, it's trickled onto the internet and today, finally, onto my ipod. Stereogum <a class="reference external" href="http://stereogum.com/archives/premature-evaluation/premature-evaluation-wolf-parade-at-mount-zoomer_009536.html">gave it a review</a> and liked it; I'm not so sure. It's too early to say, really — these tracks sound to my uneducated ear like a rough mix. Either that, or the production is going to fall far short of the mark set by their debut's trademark &quot;being pursued in the dark through the wreck of an abandoned spaceship&quot; timbre.</p>
<p>But even if that's fixed, I doubt these songs are going to live up to <em>Apologies to the Queen Mary</em>. I need to give it a few more listens, though.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>More cheerfully on all fronts: <a class="reference external" href="http://www.myspace.com/matesofstate">you can legally stream the forthcoming Mates of State album on MySpace</a> right now. It's short but excellent. Not as good as <em>Bring It Back</em>, maybe, but that record is one of my favorites. This new album, <em>Re-Arrange Us</em>, seems to me to be a little more emotionally one-dimensional — at least at first listen — but the band is continuing to avoid repeating itself while maintaining a beautiful pop center that somehow fails to be embarrassing. Not, of course, that I'm very good about being embarrassed by pop music, even when I probably should be.</p>

                    <p>It's May, the sun is out, and it seems likely that something, somewhere, is germinating. Clearly, the time has come for Album of the Summer deliberations to begin. Naturally, this will not be the <em>only</em> album of the summer. But, still, a decision must be reached. When you're in your twilight years, what album (delivered via networked cochlear implant) do you want to use to dredge up lost memories of summer '08 from beneath a river of amyloid plaque?</p>
<p>As you can see, it's a weighty decision. It needs to be something that's widely acceptable, that's fun and sunny, and that still sounds good when drowned out by a blender.</p>
<p>The album I've been hearing people talk about most is the new Portishead. Pitchfork called it &quot;darker and bleaker&quot;, &quot;abrasive&quot; and &quot;jittery&quot;. The first paragraph notwithstanding, this is not exactly what I'm looking for in a soundtrack for sunburning myself.</p>
<p>I have considered other candidates and found them wanting:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dodos — I'm sorry, but I can no longer take seriously any acoustic guitar duos that don't have their own HBO series.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Wombats — I love these guys, but as their releases inched closer to the US they've gotten more and more overproduced. Their latest LP incarnation is essentially unlistenable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the new Hold Steady — Grudgingly disqualified due to non-existence.</p>
<p>I do, however, have a nomination to make: <a class="reference external" href="http://www.headlightsmusic.com/">Headlights</a>, an Illinois band that released <em>Some Racing, Some Stopping</em> at the beginning of March (Kyle was <a class="reference external" href="http://www.informationleafblower.com/blog/archives/2008/01/friday-linkage.html">on top of it</a> then). The album's first two tracks are the real standouts: <a class="reference external" href="http://hypem.com/search/get+your+head+around+it/1/">Get Your Head Around It</a> is a reverbed song about regret that slowly builds to an aching, harmony-filled crescendo. You may recall <a class="reference external" href="http://www.google.com/search?q=holy%20shit%20I%20love%20the%20wrens">how I feel about such things</a>.</p>
<p>More universally, <a class="reference external" href="http://hypem.com/search/cherry%20tulips/1/">Cherry Tulips</a> is likely to be among the prettiest things you hear this spring, suffering only from some unfortunately lame rhymes in the chorus. It's still awfully sweet, though.</p>
<p>The rest of the album is worthwhile, too. The obvious comparison is to Rilo Kiley circa <em>Execution of All Things</em>. But it's better than that: the band uses dynamics less clumsily, the sequencing on the album is actually well thought-out, and they have the good sense to keep every song under four minutes.</p>
<p>Pitchfork gave it <a class="reference external" href="http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/49082-some-racing-some-stopping">a pretty good review</a>, but one which amounted to saying, &quot;this is a good pop record, but it seems like we've had one of those before&quot;. That's the business they're in, and it's a correct evaluation. But for summertime music purposes, it's a bit beside the point.</p>

                    <p>If you know anything about my musical tastes at all, you know that I'm a fan of the Unicorns. God but I loved that band. This was a group whose first press photo was of <a class="reference external" href="/static/2008/04/15/unicorns_murdered.jpg">their brutal murder</a>, who wrote pop songs about ghosts and dying and getting famous and then some more ghosts, and who couldn't be bothered with verses and choruses because there was just too much great stuff to cram into each song. The first time I saw them they wore matching pink tuxedos and swung from the rafters.</p>
<p>The second time I saw them was months later, and they were much worse. The band played no encore and clearly had little interest in entertaining the crowd. Having the Arcade Fire open the show didn't help the band make a lasting impression, either. Not long after that the Unicorns broke up, leaving behind not much besides an album's worth of amazing songs.</p>
<p>There was hope, though: two thirds of the band, including (necessarily) one founding member split off to form a new group called Islands. Nick Diamonds (née Thorburn) and J'aime Tambeur seemed less crazy than Alden Penner, and perhaps just as talented. Two tracks leaked under the band's name, and (although I later learned they were written while the Unicorns were still together) I found them immensely encouraging — particularly this one:</p>
<blockquote>
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.manifestdensity.net/2008/04/14/Islands%20-%20Abominable%20Snow%20(early).mp3">Islands – Abominable Snow (early version)</a></blockquote>
<p>Nick Diamonds also put together <a class="reference external" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070703181458/http://www.vice-recordings.com/halloween/index.html">this</a>. And you know how I feel about that.</p>
<p>Eventually Islands released their debut album, and I kind of thought it stunk. Well, that's too harsh: it had a couple of good tracks, but it was mostly a disappointment. The songs just weren't that great. Hopefully it at least convinced some other Canadian bands to reconsider their planned cetacean-themed guest raps.</p>
<p>Now Islands' second album, <em>Arm's Way</em>, has leaked, and I'm glad to say it's much better. The songs are solid. But it's still kind of a letdown. Here, listen to the version of &quot;Abominable Snow&quot; that's included on it:</p>
<blockquote>
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.manifestdensity.net/2008/04/14/Islands%20-%20Abominable%20Snow%20%28Arm%27s%20Way%29.mp3">Islands – Abominable Snow (Arm's Way)</a></blockquote>
<p>I think it's fair to say that I am less likely to call a song overdone than most people. Have some strings available? Sure, lay em down! Horns? The more the merrier! And say, have you got enough people for the hand claps yet?</p>
<p>But this... this is bad. It's too long; it's got too much stuff; it has too little fun. And I'm afraid that the rest of the album is like it. The underlying songs are good, if generally a minute longer than they need to be. But the production is boring and the instrumentation frequently so uninspired as to be indistinguishable from a karaoke CD. The only person who consistently sounds like he's trying is Diamonds. And he only sounds like he's trying to sound like he's trying.</p>
<p>This isn't true of every song: the title track fares pretty well, and the band actually manages to let (slightly) loose during a too-cute Who reference on &quot;In The Rushes&quot; and during the sprawling &quot;Vertigo&quot;. But it's true on far too many of the songs.</p>
<p>In other words, it's exactly what I should have expected after reading Nick Diamonds <a class="reference external" href="http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/news/48677-islands-nick-thorburn-talks-iarms-wayi-side-projects">say this</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
I think in terms of the band, it's very solidified. I'm trying to think of the focus of the arrangements. It's way less off the cuff. The first record, we would invite people in, say &quot;yeah, what do you think?&quot;, and give them free reign. This is reigned in.</blockquote>
<p>I understand that the man is sick of having his new band compared to the Unicorns. That band was great, but it's over. But I do wish wish he'd move on to having another <em>band</em>, rather than just a bunch of musicians who play his songs. This album sounds like a very complicated demo tape.</p>
<p>But hey: it's much better than <em>Return to Sea</em>. It's even pretty good! It's just that given the pedigree involved, I was hoping for something extraordinary.</p>

But the palette of noises on offer from this <em>particular</em> toy is distinctly more NES-ish than most, which fires up my brain's nostalgia receptors something fierce and generally makes for some of the more pleasant 8-bit music I've heard. It makes me want to run outside and start collecting coins.</p>
<p>Unrelatedly, I'm also currently a little fixated on the song at the end of <a class="reference external" href="http://stereogum.com/archives/video/new-frightened-rabbit-video-head-rolls-off_008206.html">this Stereogum post</a>.</p>

<p>You might remember me <a class="reference external" href="/2007/12/20/hey-have-some-christmas-music/">getting excited</a> about this band's Christmas music offerings. Now I'm just excited about them in general (or at least about their upcoming album, from which this song is taken — the stuff I've heard from their last release isn't blowing me away). Scottish accents and melodrama are a winning combination.</p>

<p>After watching it a few more times, I'm convinced: that's Stephen fucking Merritt (dammit).</p>
<p>The fascinating thing about this ad is that it's almost exactly as good as any Magnetic Fields song. And I don't mean that as a compliment. Stephen Merritt gets a lot of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.pastemagazine.com/action/article/6243/feature/music/magnetic_fields_searching_for_meaning_in_the_murk">disgustingly adulatory press</a>. I think there are three reasons for this:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>He always sounds bored, which is widely regarded as a sign of sophistication.</li>
<li>His love songs are about dudes, which is considered to be even more sophisticated.</li>
<li>He spends a lot of time talking about how smart he is, which for a variety of reasons is not something that a given music press interviewer is in a position to challenge.</li>
</ul>
<p>But I don't buy it. To me his songs have always seemed long on wit and short on genuine emotion, full of calculated revelations of self-loathing but devoid of actual vulnerability. They're beautiful, cold constructions. They're satirical poems from the Victorian Era, they're the chess column in the paper hummed aloud, they're New Yorker cartoons adapted for Broadway. They might as well be about gum.</p>

                    <p>I've been meaning to link to this but kept forgetting: <a class="reference external" href="http://theremixcompany.co.uk/">RAC</a> has a <a class="reference external" href="http://popscenesf.imeem.com/music/cyyQ4tcd/the_pipettes_pull_shapes_rac_mix/">characteristically catchy remix of &quot;Pull Shapes&quot;</a> that's worth a listen. I know, I know — why touch a song that's already so great? Well, they wisely don't do too much to it. But it's at least a somewhat novel take on a well-worn track, and may be marginally more dance-friendly by virtue of having fewer slow parts (although clearly I'm not really qualified to judge).</p>

                    <p>Ryan <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ryanavent.com/blog/?p=662">disagrees</a> with my Christmas rock boosterism. I'll just go ahead and quote the whole post:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">I have to tell you guys, I am not a fan of Christmas rock songs and/or modern interpretations of old Christmas stand-bys. Why is this? I donâ€™t know. Pretty much the only departure from Burl Ivesâ€™ old school standards Iâ€™ll tolerate (love actually) is Vince Guaraldiâ€™s Charlie Brown Christmas soundtrack. Although I do like the Velvet Fog doing â€œA Christmas Song.â€?</div>
<div class="line">This may have something to do with a deep sense that Christmas is actually a celebration of the past more than anything elseâ€“not something to be modernized. Or it could just be the long, looooong list of abominations resulting from contemporary acts doing Christmas songs.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Naturally, I feel differently. To me the Christmas standards don't feel so much classic as they do dated. They were a part of my childhood, so of course I enjoy listening to them for the sake of nostalgia. But I think that it's wrong to consider them as the ur-Christmas songs. &quot;Holly Jolly Christmas&quot;, &quot;Winter Wonderland&quot;, &quot;Rudolph&quot; — <em>those</em> were the songs that constituted a departure from the past, as song &amp; dance men cranked out superficial, secular story-songs in tandem with the rise of the Christmas-Industrial complex.</p>
<p>In some ways I think the best of the new songs actually harken back to the pre-ditty era of Christmas music. Not because they're reconnecting with the holiday's religious aspect, but because the songs are able to tap into a pool of surprisingly universal experience. With partial apologies to my Jewish friends, there are plenty of emotionally resonant aspects to this time of year that we've all felt: wintery quiet, loneliness, warmth, grandeur, joy. I won't sit here and pretend that <em>Maybe This Christmas XXIV</em> brings tears to my eyes, but it's likely to be a hell of a lot more artistically successful than a song about a magical snowman.</p>

                    <p>When it comes to holiday music I am, let's face it, kind of an idiot. Thematic appropriateness can make me completely forget about how good a song actually is. All I can do is apologize to those who've been subjected to the resulting playlist atrocities.</p>
<p>With that said, this (<a class="reference external" href="http://stereogum.com/archives/mp3/holidays-are-a-time-of-cheer-free-mp3s_007466.html">via Stereogum</a>) is a really goddamn good Christmas song:</p>

<p>The greatest Christmas rock song of all time, is, of course, <a class="reference external" href="http://hypem.com/search/fairytale%20of%20new%20york/1/">The Pogues' &quot;Fairytale of New York&quot;</a>, but this entry from Frightened Rabbit has quickly vaulted into my number two spot — evidence, perhaps, of the weakness of the field. But there are a few others that I think can be defended in the clear light of day, even when judgment is unclouded by wood smoke and wassail.</p>
<p>There are some obvious ones. John Lennon's &quot;So This Is Christmas&quot; and Run DMC's &quot;Christmas Is&quot; are both classics and so hardly worth mentioning. The Kinks' &quot;<a class="reference external" href="http://fuelfriends.blogspot.com/2007/12/christmas-mixery.html">Father Christmas</a>&quot; is just as good but more often neglected, which is a shame. And U2's &quot;Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)&quot; is pretty damn great — it's probably my second-favorite U2 song behind &quot;Red Hill Mining Town&quot;, if only because when Bono cracks up mid-verse you can tell that for at least three seconds he's not trying to save the world. Unfortunately, the music blogosphere considers U2 so desperately uncool that I can't find a playable copy of the song on the Hype Machine. But if you'd rather listen to Death Cab For Cutie's awful, awful cover, there are <a class="reference external" href="http://hypem.com/search/baby%20please%20come%20home/1/">about a zillion copies available</a>. It is, if nothing else, a useful demonstration of every single thing that's wrong with Ben Gibbard and his mostly-fine band.</p>
<p>Those are all very well-known songs, though. Here are three more that, while not exactly obscure, haven't entirely made their way out of the Christmas compilation ghetto. But they're all genuinely good songs (if not very creatively titled):</p>

                    <p>Jeff has <a class="reference external" href="http://www.jeffnye.org/adventures/2007/12/that_time_of_year.php">commanded</a> that year-end lists be produced; let it be so.</p>
<p>Actually, though, I can't recommend too much. There were a lot of albums that I wanted to like but ultimately found disappointing. Okkervil River never grabbed me after the single; neither did The National. Patrick Wolf wears out his welcome after the first three songs. Le Loup's album is more of a one-trick pony than was initially apparent. And although I love a number of tracks on Dan Deacon's album (mostly the ones where he keeps his mouth shut), I found &quot;Wham City&quot; and its ilk to be really grating. Jens Lekman's too precious, Polyphonic Spree evolved one album too late, Los Campesinos couldn't seal the deal and Of Montreal proved to be astoundingly irritating. Man, there's no pleasing me! It seemed like a year of singles, with precious few full-lengths worth listening to end-to-end.</p>
<p>But there were a few albums I couldn't help playing over and over. This list isn't going to blow any minds, but I enjoyed writing it out. Y'know, for posterity.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Arcade Fire — Neon Bible</dt>
<dd>Predictable, I know. Well, so's the rest of my list. I'm putting this first, though, because it's the one I feel most lukewarm toward. It's full of good music, but it's fundamentally a betrayal. AF's first album was all about their fear of growing old, growing callous, feeling less. They howled and screamed and swore that they'd figure a way out of it. Then they didn't. Thanks a fucking lot, guys. That the only track recapturing their original manifesto — &quot;No Cars Go&quot; — was a new version of a song from their debut EP only added insult to injury. Still, they make some awfully pretty sounds.</dd>
<dt>Feist – The Reminder</dt>
<dd>It's really good. C'mon, you've seen the ad. Who are you to resist?</dd>
<dt>The Cribs – Men's Needs, Women's Needs, Whatever</dt>
<dd>It's just a consistently good rock album. If you ask me, an inability to say more than that makes for a relatively rare sort of endorsement.</dd>
<dt>Stars – Up In Our Bedroom After The War</dt>
<dd>Maybe I just didn't understand Stars when I listened to their last album. Or, more likely, maybe I was just clinging to the pretension that I'm not the sort of guy who listens to musical theater voluntarily. Well, I'm over it. This album isn't uniformly great, but it has enough standout pop songs that the rest can be considered pleasant-enough glue. After all, you've got to have some quiet solo pieces to kill time while the stagehands move the set around.</dd>
<dt>The Wombats – Girls, Boys and Marsupials</dt>
<dd>Alright, so this technically came out in 2006. But their stuff is just now trickling out in US releases, so I feel alright about mentioning it. <em>This</em> is what I was hoping to hear as I diligently listened to the Arctic Monkeys and Cold War Kids. Between The Wombats and The Cribs I guess this year found me in the mood for bratty English vocals. The songs are funny and clever and dumb, and awfully good.
And yes, I'm still mourning the Unicorns.</dd>
<dt>Spoon – Ga Ga Ga Ga Ga</dt>
<dd>Far and away the best album of the year — for me, it's really not even close. I think I once drunkenly described this album as &quot;economical&quot;, and I may as well stand by that. Everything is so well-constructed, every gesture placed with such casual perfection that it's tempting to conclude that it couldn't be more than a cold architectural exercise. But when faced with the opening Motown chimes of &quot;You Got Yr. Cherry Bomb&quot;, that idea melts away. Also: points for brevity.</dd>
</dl>
<p>This year was also the first in which I listened to much electronic (or at least non-rock, non-rap) music. I'm not straying too far from my familiar pop pastures — RJD2, Ratatat, Diplo, the aforementioned Mr. Deacon, that sort of thing. I'll be the first to admit that I don't know very much about the genres contained under the electronic umbrella, and probably need to spend some more time listening diligently and uncritically. But I'm trying, at least a little. I realize that millions of club kids can't be wrong. I'm the one who's wrong.</p>
<p>With that said, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/47681-staff-list-top-100-tracks-of-2007/page_1">Pitchfork's list of the year's best songs</a> still baffles me. &quot;All My Friends&quot; sounds to me like a not-that-good Franz Ferdinand song and little more. And somewhere around the fifth minute of Battles' &quot;Atlas&quot; I get <em>real</em> sick of hearing plodding repetitions of melodies that could be ably picked out on a keyboard with two fingers. I'm of the opinion that Daft Punk made their point a while ago and should now be polite enough to leave me alone.</p>
<p>My lack of patience is probably to blame. If you set up a melodic pattern I want my expectations of how it's going to progress to be promptly defied. Going through the motions for an extra measure or two earns my boredom (and ill will) very quickly. Perhaps this consigns me to a life of listening to variations on the same tired three minute pop song — I realize that a very limited bag of tricks is being used over and over again to surprise and delight me. But so far I'm not sick of it.</p>
<p>Finally, one last bit of carping: I'm really surprised that the M.I.A. juggernaut continues to roll along. It seems like a transparent case of style over substance to me, but people <em>really</em> seem to dig her stuff. So I'll say that I think I must be missing something and hope that my half-earnestness counts as personal growth.</p>

I'm pretty sure I've seen this before, but had forgotten about it. It's a good list, with one exception:</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>New Radicals:</strong> There are only five facts publicly known about this entity. The first is that 1998â€™s â€œYou Get What You Giveâ€? is an almost flawless Todd Rundgrenâ€“like masterwork that makes any right-thinking American want to run through a Wal-Mart semi-naked. The second is that nobody can remember the singerâ€™s name. The third is that the singer often wore a profoundly idiotic hat. The fourth is that if this anonymous, poorly hatted singer had made a follow-up album, it would have somehow made his first record seem worse. The fifth is that his album didnâ€™t quite deserve to go gold, and it didnâ€™t.</blockquote>
<p>This is wrong, except for the bit about the hat. &quot;You Get What You Give&quot; is abysmal. It's one of those inexplicably ubiquitous songs that force listeners to conclude that the singer must be the son or daughter or lover of a powerful record industry executive. The chorus and the verses blur together, it falls back on percussive vocal delivery to hide how boring the melody is, and the lyrics are intensely banal in the sort of way that only a pop-music sentiment that's a) two decades old and b) <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_End_(The_Beatles_song)">written by Paul McCartney</a> can be. It sounds like Jamiroquai singing tunelessly to himself in the shower and forgetting most of the words. It's really, really bad.</p>
<p>Also, the stupidity of that hat really can't be overstated.</p>

The Lovekevins? Sure you do. Well, they're going to be playing at Natalya and Melissa's <a class="reference external" href="http://www.myspace.com/hejhejdc">Scandi-pop DJ night</a> at DC9 on <a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/22137978&#64;N00/532276021/">July 10</a>. Sounds like fun.</p>
<p>More immediately: Charles is playing at Chief Ike's on Thursday. I guess that Aaron, Spencer and Bayes will be there too. You should still come, though.</p>
<p>And finally, EVEN MORE immediately, I think Emily and I will be heading down to the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.olddominionbrewhouse.com/">Old Dominion Brewhouse</a> tonight to consume towers of beer*, watch the NHL finals in glorious HD and, in my case, write the morning roundup. I called the place and have been told that they may have internet but not wifi, and it only works sometimes. It was a confusing exchange, but I remain optimistic. If you've got an inclination to eat some fried snacks and drink Molson, drop on by.</p>
<p>* for those unfamiliar with D.C.'s premiere brewery-themed conventioneer destination, this is the literal distribution mechanism the place uses</p>

With <a class="reference external" href="http://www.myspace.com/thedaybreakline">The Daybreak Line</a>! Quickly now — agree to come before my tolerance for exclamation points falters!</p>
<p>I really am looking forward to this. These guys have been playing together for a while now — it'll be interesting to see the evolution from their Velvet Lounge debut to tonight. Plus, Adam says they have a bunch of new material. Even if they didn't, the stuff from their band-creating LP sounds newly great since being rerecorded. I particularly like this one:</p>
<blockquote>
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.thecityveins.com/music/ToeTheLine.mp3">The City Veins – Toe The Line</a></blockquote>
<p>I think it's one of the best songs (and most tastefully restrained performances) I've ever heard from these guys in any of the various band incarnations they've been in. You can find more of the rerecorded album <a class="reference external" href="http://www.thecityveins.com/blog/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Oh, and if anyone feels like joining us for dinner on H Street before the show, send me an email. Otherwise, I hope to see you at the show.</p>

And with their aggressive &amp; lousy drumming; dreamy feedback; dreary, meandering keyboards; and singing that sort of recalls Tom Morello (until you see the vocalist is, like, 8), I think they'd fit right in.</p>

                    <p>But <a class="reference external" href="http://outtamindouttasite.typepad.com/outtasite/2007/05/oh_yeah_i_have_.html#more">Catherine's right</a> — Friday's Arcade Fire show wasn't a particularly great one. Don't get me wrong: it was very good — amazingly so, given the terrible venue. But it wasn't up to the standard they had set during their shows at the Black Cat and 9:30 club. There wasn't much improvisation; the three-song encore was short; Regine <em>really</em> can't sing while drumming; and they generally seemed less-committed to the performance than they have in the past.</p>
<p>I got my money's worth, but this is a band whose live act I typically rank behind only Springsteen and the Flaming Lips. The performance at DAR wasn't nearly that good. The Saturday show in Philadelphia was considerably better despite having a nearly-identical setlist (this was partially a function of the venue being less than godawful, though).</p>
<p>It makes me happy to see that a lot of people enjoyed the show, and I certainly don't want to take away from that. But trust me: this band is capable of even more.</p>
<p><strong>ALSO:</strong> It might be worth noting that Joel, who knows a band member, reported that Winn went home immediately after the Philly show. They cancelled the final part of their European tour due to illness, and I wouldn't be surprised if they were just getting a little tired of being on the road.</p>

<p>Well, that was a hell of a success. Charles, Aaron, Adam and Spencer sounded great — amazingly so, considering that this was their first gig. Admittedly, all but the last of these guys have known each other forever and have some experience playing together. But Spencer's the drummer, and dropping in a new rhythm section is no mean feat. They couldn't have practiced more than a half dozen times as a full band, but you wouldn't have known it from listening to 'em. It was a great debut.</p>
<p>Part of the credit has to go to the Velvet Lounge, whose resident sound guy has a reputation for being the only U Street audio engineer that consistently gives a damn. But part &amp; parcel with that is the undeniable loudness of the tiny space.

The short version: take some aspirin or vitamin E after a loud show. And, if at all possible, be African American.</p>

                    <p>Why aren't there more reviews of leaked albums? The delay between when blogospheric buzz leads me to hear a record and its actual release date seems to have increased in the last six months. These days I frequently find myself wondering what the press thinks about the albums I'm currently most excited about, only to realize that they're abiding by the laws of the labels, not the anarchy of the internet.</p>
<p>The tradition of holding off on reviewing a CD until it's on shelves seems defensible to me. It'd be a shame to let those who have taken advantage of leaked copies hurt artists even further by depressing their sales with potentially buzz-deflating reviews. And of course the leaked product isn't always the final one, so judging an early, surreptitiously-obtained copy might be unfair. I've done it, but I'm just a lowly amateur blogger. Major reviewers seemed to respect release dates, and it seems admirable that they do.</p>
<p>But I wonder how long it'll hold. Stereogum's a blog, sure, but they've also got a gigantic audience. And they're now <a class="reference external" href="http://www.stereogum.com/archives/004811.html">making a feature</a> out of reviewing leaked albums. It seems unavoidable that the practice will seep into Pitchfork, then Rolling Stone, then, hell, I don't know — NPR?</p>
<p>At any rate, this trend seems inevitable and superficially unfortunate, but also something that musicians can probably adapt to without too much trouble. Reducing the amount of time between the end of mastering and the album's official release date is the most obvious solution, although that'll necessitate less carefully-scheduled releases. But that's probably fine, too: the only real justification for such precise timing that I'm aware of is a label's desire to stretch its releases out so that revenue stays even through the year, and so that similar acts in their stable don't step on one another's toes. Maybe there's another reason, but if there is I can't think of it at the moment.</p>
<p>I think the labels are doomed anyway, so removing their scheduling abilities isn't any great tragedy. Bands will record on their own. If they need to schedule strategically, their smaller number of personnel will make it easier to prevent leaks. More often they'll probably just release the album as soon as they can — I can't imagine that too many artists enjoy having to wait to release their work.</p>

I was all set to lapse into ArcadeFirecentricity, with only an occasional <a class="reference external" href="http://www.movering.com/node/329">Swimmers</a> song breaking the monotony of my non-ticket-having despair. But then all of a sudden <a class="reference external" href="http://unitedhates.blogspot.com/">my sister</a> appeared with AF tickets, and I unexpectedly found a bunch of other music to be excited about. And the Dismemberment Plan are <a class="reference external" href="http://www.dcist.com/archives/2007/03/01/you_are_invited.php">playing a reunion show</a>! Everything's great!</p>
<p>In fact I just got back from seeing <a class="reference external" href="http://karmellasgame.com/home.html">Karmella's Game</a> at the Black Cat with <a class="reference external" href="http://www.matthewyglesias.com">Yglesias</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://outtamindouttasite.typepad.com">Catherine</a>. It's been years since I last saw KG, but they were just as charming as I remembered — and now they had better songs to back up their overwhelming charisma. I really don't understand why these guys aren't better-known than they are. When a band performs harmonies with as many parts as it has personnel I take it as a very good sign. Well, if they pull it off, anyway, which Karmella's Game did.</p>
<p>So that bring us to this post's first mp3. Have at it (and my apologies to the band for hosting it — I wouldn't have, except your last.fm page is broken):</p>

<p>Moving on! I stumbled upon The Wombats a few days ago. I know that their NME heyday may have already come and gone, but their new EP (leaked in December, apparently) seems stronger to me than their last album (although that's good, too — more mp3s <a class="reference external" href="http://spuckle.blogspot.com/2006/12/wombats-moving-to-new-york.html">here</a>):</p>

                    <p>I watched some of the Grammies last night, but I think I repressed everything that happened after the Eagles tribute. So it comes as an unpleasant shock to hear <a class="reference external" href="http://blogstretch.blogspot.com/2007/02/beginning-and-end.html">from Amanda</a> that &quot;My Humps&quot; won an award last night. I can't say that I ever expected to feel indignant sympathy for the Pussycast Dolls, but <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nominees_for_Grammy_Awards_of_2007#Best_Pop_Performance_by_a_Duo_or_Group_with_Vocal">there it is</a>.</p>
<p>I know, I know. It's the Grammies. It's supposed to be arbitrary and stupid. Still, there's something that's off-putting about an entity of pure evil receiving official recognition, no matter how dubious the honor. What if <em>Mein Kampf</em> was selected for Oprah's Book Club? That wouldn't sit right with you, would it?</p>
<p>And so it is with &quot;My Humps&quot;. I'm trying to think of what sort of song I would have preferred to see the Best Pop Song Grammy go to instead, and I'm having a hard time coming up with one that doesn't qualify. Maybe an hours-long recording of a girl scout troop's pathetic sobs as its members are forced to euthanize hundreds of baby animals with rubber mallets? It's hard to say. Are we talking about farm animals or pet animals? I guess that's where the line falls for me.</p>

</center></p><p>On to Arcade Fire-related matters. TUL is, as usual, <a class="reference external" href="http://theupstatelife.blogspot.com/2007/02/arcade-fire-to-play-constitution-hall.html">on top of the concert situation in DC</a> (as is <a class="reference external" href="http://dccharles.blogspot.com">Charles</a>, from whom I first heard this rumor last night). But the news he brings is not good: word is that The Arcade Fire are coming to town, but they'll be setting up shop in DAR.</p>
<p>I really hope this is wrong. DAR is for old people. There are seats and risers and carpeted floors. I'm sure it'd be a lovely spot for Glenn Miller show, but it's a miserable venue for a rock concert. I realize that two nights at 9:30 is a lot to ask from a band that's as hot a ticket as TAF, but I'd honestly rather have the band play out at George Mason than at DAR.</p>
<p>Oh well. At least the album is good. I was prepared to be disappointed after hearing the three leaked tracks that I grabbed before a friend sent me the full thing. &quot;Black Mirror&quot;, &quot;Black Wave&quot; and &quot;Intervention&quot; were all okay, but they didn't affect me in the way that <em>Funeral</em> did. Fortunately, the second half of the album seems much, much better to me. &quot;Ocean of Noise&quot;, &quot;The Well and the Lighthouse&quot;, &quot;(Antichrist Television Blues)&quot;, &quot;Windowsill&quot; and &quot;No Cars Go&quot; comprise a solid block of music that I can't stop listening to.</p>
<p>&quot;No Cars Go&quot; is a particularly pleasant surprise — I hadn't paid attention to the <em>Neon Bible</em> tracklists, so the inclusion of the track caught me off-guard. They've been playing the song for a long time (it was on their first album) but until now I haven't been able to find a good recording. The first studio version wasn't performed or produced very well, and a series of muddy live recordings didn't satisfy, either.</p>
<p>But now we've got a real version, and it's unbelievably huge, overwhelming and, frankly, kind of exhausting to listen to. But it's still great, because it reminds you that during the live show it'll be <em>even bigger</em>. It'll be the biggest thing you've ever heard.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> <a class="reference external" href="http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/news/41118">Yup, DAR</a>. Hell. Well, maybe I can catch the Philly show.</p>

                    <p>It's slightly ridiculous, but I have to confess that I've only recently discovered <a class="reference external" href="http://hype.non-standard.net">Hype Machine</a>. I've been aware of its existence for a while, but my previous attempts to use it always met with failure. The flash player didn't work right on my old laptop, and the HM iTunes link never has and still doesn't work properly for me. With those functions unavailable, I didn't see a compelling-enough reason to use the site.</p>
<p>But, spurred by references to it in an Unfogged thread, I gave it another shot, got the flash player to work, and found out that it's unbelievably great. There's one major downside, though: I seem to run into buffering problems with the player on a pretty regular basis. This is an infuriating way to listen to music, and particularly bad when I try to use the app through the Wii web browser (the console is hooked up to my stereo, after all — in theory, this could make for a great at-home radio station).</p>
<p>The HM flash player uses the open-source <a class="reference external" href="http://musicplayer.sourceforge.net/">XSPF Music Player</a>, so I'm optimistic that I'll be able to crack it open and implement some more stringent buffering. Unfortunately, my initial explorations revealed that the site uses some irritating redirects and is going to require me to do stupid things like fake my HTTP referer and user agent string. I realize that's gibberish to many of you, but trust me when I say that it's totally lame.</p>
<p>So it may be a little while before I really get my hands dirty with this project. In the meantime, I can't resist posting these two tracks, both of which I'm a little obsessed with (the latter despite not really liking CYHSY):</p>

                    <p>This time <a class="reference external" href="http://dceiver.blogspot.com/2006/12/our-top-fifty-reactions-to-pitchforks.html">has come</a> to complain about <a class="reference external" href="http://pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/40007/Staff_List_Top_50_Albums_of_2006">Pitchfork's year end list</a>. Allow me to join the terrifying din. Like <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ryanavent.com/blog/?p=195">Ryan</a>, I've never heard of The Knife. In fact, there's a ton of stuff on the list that I haven't listened to. I suppose I probably should, although the rankings of the stuff I recognize do not inspire confidence (nor does the seeming overrepresentation of hiphop, electronica and hard rock — three genres that I only enjoy in intermittent doses, and almost never when recommended by Pitchfork).</p>
<p>We don't have the perspective to make a final judgment, but right now it seems like 2006 was kind of a thin year when compared to <a class="reference external" href="http://djmonstermo.blogspot.com/2005/12/pitchfork-top-50-albums-of-2005.html">the</a> <a class="reference external" href="http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/38230/Staff_List_Top_50_Albums_of_2004/page_1">last</a> <a class="reference external" href="http://old-site.pitchforkmedia.com/top/2003/index.shtml">three</a>. They say that the best music is produced when Republicans are in charge, so maybe the shifting national mood resulted in fewer great albums. Personally, I prefer to blame Canada: they've been propping up our indie rock economy for years, but this year were suddenly and strangely absent. I guess this is what it's going to be like when China stops floating the national debt. Here's hoping that our Northern neighbors have got something big planned for 2007.</p>
<p>Anyway, even putting aside all of my ignorance, ambivalence and vague hostility toward the p-fork list, there are a few things that I was surprised not to see show up there. Here are some albums that I thought ought to have been present, and which Amazon assures me were released in 2006:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><strong>Mates of State – Bring It Back</strong>
I don't expect anyone to condone my shameless lust for pop. But for those who share the same affliction, I can't recommend this album highly enough.</li>
<li><strong>Figurines – Skeleton</strong>
Yeah, it's a little too Modest-Mousey to get complete credit for originality. Still, it's varied but without any clunkers, and it holds up well to repeated listens. &quot;Silver Ponds&quot; and &quot;Other Plans&quot; are going to be in my playlists for a long time to come.</li>
<li><strong>Karmella's Game – The Art Of Distraction</strong>
This record is so catchy as to ultimately be exhausting, but it'd be hard to overstate KG's underdog appeal. &quot;Safely Negative&quot; is especially good, I think. I didn't actually expect Pitchfork to notice this record, of course, but I wish they had anyway.</li>
<li><strong>Gnarls Barkley – St. Elsewhere</strong>
Is it because <em>Crazy</em> was leaked in 2005? Because the rest of the album is mostly solid but non-mind-blowing? Or is it because half of all commercials in 2006 used it as their score? Whatever the reason, I'm confused by Pitchfork's refusal to acknowledge the album that contained the biggest song of 2006. They <a class="reference external" href="http://old-site.pitchforkmedia.com/top/2003/index3.shtml">extended the courtesy to Outkast</a>, didn't they?</li>
<li><strong>Malajube – Tromp L'oeil</strong>
I'm probably just including it because it's the best thing I've heard recently, and because I miss Canada. I've had a hard time finding albums to love in the second half of 2006.</li>
<li><strong>I'm From Barcelona – Let Me Introduce My Friends</strong></li>
<li><strong>Beirut – Gulag Orkestar</strong>
I've got a feeling that this album trades on traditions that it has no right to claim, but I wouldn't really know and I'm certainly not qualified to be the one bringing that criticism to bear. So it just ends up making me feel vaguely uneasy about the whole project. Pretty good tunes, though.</li>
<li><strong>Rainer Maria – Catastrophe Keeps Us Together</strong>
Throw 'em a bone, guys.</li>
<li><strong>Annuals – Be He Me</strong>
I'm not sure where this ought to be ranked — to be honest, I've got to listen to it some more. But &quot;Brother&quot; alone puts it on my list... somewhere.</li>
</ol>
<p>Also: no <em>Yeah Yeah Yeahs</em>? I started listening to it late, so I don't know how I'd rank it, but it seems awfully good. Better than the <em>Band of Horses</em> album, at least.</p>
<p>Things on the list that I recognized and have listened to, but don't think should be there:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Joanna Newsom – Ys</strong>
If you're only working with five songs, you'd better make sure you're doing so for a reason. I'm not convinced that Ms. Newsom manages this: I thought that the first half of this record meandered unforgivably before finally getting a hold of itself. I can't help but wonder how much of the acclaim this album has received is due to its novelty. Thanks to my mom I've probably heard somewhat more harp music than is normal for my demographic. <em>Ys</em> doesn't stand out from rest of it as much as some reviewers seem to think it does.</li>
<li><strong>Sunset Rubdown – Shut Up I Am Dreaming</strong>
I love Wolf Parade. <em>Apologies To The Queen Mary</em> is one of my favorite CDs, and their show at the Black Cat was probably the best concert I saw in 2006. But c'mon Pitchfork — despite your assurances to the contrary, this is not a particularly compelling side project. It's more Bell Orchestre than Postal Service: pleasant enough, but completely forgettable.</li>
<li><strong>Phoenix – It's Never Been Like That</strong>
This album felt thin to me in the same way that the recent French Kicks and Pony Up albums did. It's not the songwriting — there's just a certain oomph that was lacking from the album performances. Someone call Timbaland.</li>
<li><strong>Pipettes – We Are The Pipettes</strong>
Alright — maybe I'd leave it on. I don't know. &quot;Pull Shapes&quot; is one of the best songs of the year, and if there was any justice the track would currently be in use to sell us soda and cellphones and automobiles. But after the next one or two really good tracks the songs' quality starts to decline quickly. I'm always enthusiastic about this album when I start playing it, but I'm also always sick of it by the time it's over. The fact that a gimmick, a couple of great songs and bunch of filler can put you in the company of the year's forty-nine other best releases says something about 2006's crop of music, I think.</li>
</ul>

<p>It's perhaps not the most mind-blowing thing they've ever recorded. But I'm glad to hear it for two reasons. First, it isn't a radical departure from their last album (I want more!). And second, it makes me think about what it'll be like to once again see Winn Butler singing it like he's never meant anything more, while the strings swell and the percussionists go crazy.

<div class="line">Well, I hate to be a downer. But I <a class="reference external" href="http://www.andysullivan.com/blog/?p=236">have</a> to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.dcist.com/archives/2006/11/27/what_did_you_th_1.php#comments">disagree</a>: I thought the Hold Steady were merely Pretty Good on Saturday. As great as the new album is, as raucous as the guitars sounded, as joyous as the band was, there were some problems.</div>
<div class="line">First, and predictably, the Black Cat sound: it was lousy, as usual. The keyboards on this last record are more important than they have been before, but they were nearly inaudible whenever the guitars were going. Sucky, sucky, sucky.</div>
<div class="line">Second and more importantly, by the end of the show Craig Finn seemed more than a little drunk. That can be fine and charming, but this time, and to this curmudgeon, it wasn't. His tossed-off alternate phrasings got grating, particularly during a downright Shatnerian performance of &quot;Hot Soft Light&quot;. I'm all for changing up arrangements during a live show, but this was closer to Duritz than Dylan.</div>
<div class="line">But I don't mean to complain too much. It may not have been as enjoyable as <a class="reference external" href="http://www.zunta.org/blog/archives/2006/02/02/pygs_at_the_doo/">last February's concert</a>, but it was still a good show by a great band. I'm glad I went, but I would've been pretty pissed off if I'd been one of the people who got beer sprayed on them. But then, I <em>am</em> approximately a million years old. Consarnit.</div>

                    <p>Well, I've been trying. My attempts to find new music usually come in fits and starts — Pitchfork's <a class="reference external" href="http://pitchforkmedia.com/page/best_new_music">best new music section</a> is generally pretty reliable, but sometimes they spend months and months in genres that I'm not interested in (or my RSS subscription to the section breaks which l, uh, just discovered it had). When that happens it's time to hit up the music blogs and take some shots in the dark.</p>
<p>I did that, and I grabbed the new Decemberists, too. Unfortunately, the results were kind of disappointing. It could be that I just need to give these albums a few more listens. Or my unfavorable impression may have been due to my <a class="reference external" href="http://www.etymotic.com/ephp/er6.aspx">fancy-pants earphones</a> being in the shop for service yet again (yes, I'm a snob), leaving me to listen through muddy $10 wraparounds that I bought at CVS out of desperation. Whatever the reason, the following failed to adequately whelm me:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt><strong>Pony Up! - Make Love To The Judges With Your Eyes</strong></dt>
<dd>Inspired by <a class="reference external" href="http://cliptip.blogspot.com/2006/12/pony-up-truth-about-cats-and-dogs-is.html">this</a> cliptip post, I gave this band a try. They've got the songs but not the production. The album sounds like a well-made demo tape — there's a lot of potential, but the execution is uninspired. All they really need is a pro in the studio, forcing them to play through each composition like it's going to be the last pop song before the world ends. I'll check in next album (or maybe next tour).</dd>
<dt><strong>The Decemberists - The Crane Wife</strong></dt>
<dd>Colin Meloy's epic ornithophiliac triptych gets off to a rockin' start. But it drags, it's pretentiously out-of-order (and that's in addition to the Decemberists' normal baseline of pretension), and what's up with combining parts one and two into a single track? Do the Decemberists really think they're going to single-handedly turn the tide against the ipodification of their industry? Cause, uh, they won't, regardless of how many <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Crane-Wife-Odds-Bodkin/dp/0152014071/sr=8-2/qid=1163563676/ref=pd_bbs_2/002-0432362-5412058?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books">Japanese birdfucking myths</a> they reference. And given that, I'd prefer that they stop screwing up my meticulous playlist management.</dd>
<dt><strong>Cold War Kids - Robbers and Cowards</strong></dt>
<dd>To my ears these guys sort of sound like the Arctic Monkeys, except tired. Given that I'm not a big Arctic Monkeys fan, that's enough to consign them to my ipod harddrive reclamation efforts. Also, I'm bothered by the fact that the first thing I ever read about this band was in the context of complaints that they were getting too much blog-buzz. Same thing with <a class="reference external" href="http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/index.php/I_am_in_your_base_killing_your_d00ds">this meme</a>. I think internet fads now occur at such a speed that they can only be observed as they destructively collide with boredom, sending particles of ennui and ascii skittering across [STRIKEOUT:a bubble chamber] BoingBoing.</dd>
</dl>
<p>So that's the current, sad state of my attempts at musical exploration. I can legitimately recommend the Annuals album, though (as Caralyn noted <a class="reference external" href="http://fillygrrrl.blogspot.com/2006/10/should-i-stay-with-dear-brother-at.html">here</a>). And hey, you haven't worked all the way through <a class="reference external" href="http://dceiver.blogspot.com/2006/11/october-top-20.html">this list</a> yet, have you?</p>
<p>ALSO MUSICALLY RELATED!: Is that Rhett Miller singing the latest Chili's commercial? A: Yes, <a class="reference external" href="http://music.netscape.com/story/2006/10/26/rhett-miller-sings-about-chilis-baby-back-ribs/">yes it is</a>.</p>

I wouldn't be so hard on yourself, G.</div>
<div class="line">Call me crazy, wrongheaded, dangerously deranged but... isn't Beck sort of just-okay? Sure, he's put out a lot of pretty good pop songs. But I can't say that any of them have moved me or gotten stuck in my head (at least, not in a good way). My favorite thing that he's done remains, by far, the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.progressiveboink.com/justin/Futurama/beck1.jpg">Futurama episode that he appeared in</a>. I wouldn't mind seeing one of his shows, but I don't think I'd go through very much discomfort for one. Besides, the Black Cat back stage sucks. And he's a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.xenu.net">Scientologist</a>. Fuck 'im.</div>
<div class="line">But I could be wrong. I'm no Beckologist — all I know is that <em>Sea Change</em> bored the hell out of me. Maybe I'm completely missing the point.

                    <p>Once you publicly identify yourself as a geek, you start to hear a lot of ideas for internet projects from acquaintances. Anybody who's spent much time on the internet has at one time or another had an apparently monumentally great idea for a website that convinced them, for about half of an afternoon, that they were about to be rich. I'll refrain from reciting some of the more embarrassing ones I've heard, but they're frequently pretty bad.</p>
<p>There are three things working against you when you try to become a geek's idea man. First, the idea's probably terrible. No offense, it's just how these things go. Second, someone's almost certainly already done it, and folks generally don't bother doing any research before pitching it to a geek (who then has to figure out how to politely demur). Third, geeks have their own ideas for projects, and will usually find them more interesting and/or potentially profitable than third-party ones.</p>
<p>Hmm. This blog post is off to a strangely negative start. Well, nevermind all that. All I really wanted to say is that a while ago I had an idea to offer band-specific RSS feeds from Pollstar at a central site, letting folks track when their favorite bands were coming to town. I never got around to it, since it's not all that interesting an idea from a technical standpoint. But <a class="reference external" href="http://earfeeder.com/">look</a>! Somebody went ahead and did me one better, adding news and reviews and presales to the feed. Doing me <em>two</em> better, they programmed a Java applet that scans your hard drive to identify the bands you want on your watchlist.</p>
<p>Sadly, the Java thingy didn't work very well for me. I keep my music on my ipod and a server backup rather than my laptop hard drive, and I had to click the &quot;find more music&quot; link after the first round of searching to get it to look through the mp3s there. And once it started, it stalled out after 60some songs.</p>
<p>Still, it's a pretty nice idea, and if you keep your music on your hard drive it might really come in handy.</p>

                    <p>I've been <a class="reference external" href="http://www.zunta.org/blog/archives/2005/01/13/not_to_put_too/">pretty excited</a> about <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Hello-Radio-Songs-Might-Giants/dp/B000FQVYF4/sr=8-1/qid=1160534460/ref=pd_bbs_1/002-0432362-5412058?ie=UTF8">this record</a> for a pretty long time. An album of covers of They Might Be Giants songs? With The Wrens handling &quot;Birdhouse In Your Soul&quot;? That's something that both present- and 14-year-old-me would stand in line for (which would be fun in its own right: I'd have so much comic- and videogame-based wisdom to impart...).</p>
<p>Then the project got delayed. And then The Wrens weren't covering BIYS anymore. And then I sort of lost track of it. But the album insisted on being released anyway, emerging into the world in what would be a truly horrifying analogy if only I could think of how to come up with a metaphor for amniotic fluid that's &quot;Pitchforky&quot;.</p>
<p>Well, the CD is out as of July, but other than <a class="reference external" href="http://www.popmatters.com/pm/music/reviews/various-artists-hello-radio-the-songs-of-they-might-be-giants/">this PopMatters review</a> it doesn't seem to have attracted much attention. So, for the discriminating and/or cheap TMBG semi-completist, let me present some track-by-track impressions. An album of covers is a particularly good candidate for <a class="reference external" href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?id=160469951&amp;s=143441">an ala carte approach</a> — especially since some of these tracks are particularly bad.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt><strong>1. Self - Ana Ng</strong></dt>
<dd>What a miserable start. I hate to speak ill of the dead, but somebody clearly missed the point of this song in a profound way. &quot;Ana Ng&quot; is one of the most perfectly sad pop songs that I know. It's not a time for James Blunt vocals, precious production and intermittent assaults by fuzzed-out guitars. Boo.</dd>
<dt><strong>2. The Long Winters - Pet Name</strong></dt>
<dd>Much better. This song lies somewhere between Son Volt, Clem Snide and Ben Folds, landing in a pleasant alt-pop sort of space. The hooks are tinkered with just enough. You should probably buy it.</dd>
<dt><strong>3. David Miller - Narrow Your Eyes</strong></dt>
<dd>I should really recuse myself: this song contains handclaps. Put a few of those and/or some falsetto into a track and I'm pretty much guaranteed to like it. My opinion is worthless, enthusiastic though it may be.</dd>
<dt><strong>4. Charles Douglas - She's An Angel</strong></dt>
<dd>I'm not a huge fan of the original track. If you are, but wish it sounded like an increasingly-unconvincing Pavement cover, this might be right up your alley.</dd>
<dt><strong>5. Frank Black - Road Movie To Berlin</strong></dt>
<dd>Black Francis takes what I find to be a pretty godawful song and turns it into a totally-serviceable mumbly barroom dirge. It's the sort of essentially boring thing that white guys listen to in the last few years before they give up on rock and start obsessing over the blues. To be honest, I don't mind it at all. But then, I <em>do</em> have a birthday coming up.</dd>
<dt><strong>6. The Wrens - They'll Need A Crane</strong></dt>
<dd>Here's where it gets tricky. This is the band I got this album to hear. And while it's no &quot;Birdhouse In Your Soul&quot;, &quot;They'll Need A Crane&quot; is still a great song: superficially silly but with an underlying poignancy. And the band makes an ambitious choice from the start, moving the song's transformative centerpiece bridge to the very beginning of the song.
But then they don't follow through. Don't get me wrong — they give is a thorough Wrensification (or, more accurately, a complete <em>Meadowlands</em>ing). But it feels like they didn't want to waste too many good ideas on somebody else's song. Or maybe they only had a four-track recorder lying around. I donno. It's good, but it's not the revelation I was unreasonably hoping for.</dd>
<dt><strong>7. Steve Burns - Dead</strong></dt>
<dd>When you get down to it, the original version of this song doesn't have much going for it other than its weird and charmingly bouncy cadence. It turns out that slowing everything down, then throwing in harps and some half-hearted glitch-pop feints is a bad idea.</dd>
<dt><strong>8. OK GO - Letterbox</strong></dt>
<dd>It's pretty funny hearing a band this <a class="reference external" href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=NINJQ5LRh-0">treadmill-centric</a> try to sound so sinister. It's a total reimagining of the song, I'll give them that. But competing for cleverness points in a TMBG-themed milieu seems a little pointless.</dd>
<dt><strong>9. Recepter - Boat Of Car</strong></dt>
<dd>Good lord. Horribly lo-fi vocals combined with IDM noodling. It sounds like Thom Yorke is trapped under a stack of newspapers in his mother's garage.</dd>
<dt><strong>10. This Radiant Boy - Don't Let's Start</strong></dt>
<dd>Take a can't-miss pop song and add brattier <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Schneider">Fred Schneiderish</a> vocals and, yeah, it still won't miss. It's a shame that everyone sounds so bored, though. Those are the most listless guitars I've heard in a while. And, for the record, the breakdown is supposed to go &quot;deputy dog dog a ding dang depadepa / deputy dog dog a ding dang depadepa D&quot;. Thank you for your attention.</dd>
<dt><strong>11. Jason Trachtenburg - Doctor Worm</strong></dt>
<dd>You know those godawful neo-folk singers who infest the northeast? C'mon, you know who I mean: artists like Ellis Paul and Eddie From Ohio. The people who always sound like they're strummin' and singin' through a patronizin' grin while leaning over a newborn's crib? Well, that's what this sounds like. I don't know a lot about Jason Trachtenburg, but I'm guessing he's attained the level of fame he has through the gimmick that he and his wife have got going with their kid. <a class="reference external" href="http://www.firedoglake.com/2006/10/03/nrsc-uses-small-children-as-human-shields/">Good luck with that</a>.</dd>
<dt><strong>12. Fluid Ounces - It's Not My Birthday</strong></dt>
<dd>Meh.</dd>
<dt><strong>13. Brett Kull - Another First Kiss</strong></dt>
<dd>I'm torn. On the one hand, this sounds like the Adult Contemporary mix of whatever it started out as. But it's pretty inoffensive, and I'm not familiar with the original recording. So I guess it comes down to the fact that this artist's name reminds me of the movie <a class="reference external" href="http://www.badmovies.org/movies/krull/">Krull</a>, which was totally awesome. Therefore: recommended.</dd>
<dt><strong>14. Hotel Lights - The End Of The Tour</strong></dt>
<dd>It's nice to end of a positive note. The original track was a lovely song that has the misfortunate of being recorded right as TMBG became a real band instead of just two dudes with synthesizers and an occasional kidnapped violin or horn player. It still turned out pretty well, but this version proves that it could've been better. Hotel Lights leave the basic structure of the song intact but swap new instruments in and out of the arrangement, then play through it with subtlety and grace. It's certainly not a reinvention of the song, but it's probably the best track on the album.</dd>
