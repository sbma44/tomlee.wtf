                    <p>I'm sitting on the couch, watching Tivoed episodes of <a class="reference external" href="http://travel.discovery.com/fansites/bourdain/bourdain-season3.html">Tony Bourdain's fantastic travel show</a>, sipping coffee and settling in for a day of <a class="reference external" href="/2007/03/14/similarity-matrix-2/">coding-for-fun</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://asap.washingtonpost.com/tourneytracker/bracket.html?FxeL">basketball-watching</a> (I got off to an okay start, but I know I'm doomed). It's so, so nice.</p>
<p>Naturally enough, I'm psyching myself up for all of this by reading some old material on the internet about professional wrestling. What could be more logical? I used to know an awful lot about it, considering myself a &quot;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.doubletongued.org/index.php/dictionary/smark/">smart mark</a>&quot;. I even went to the theater to watch <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyond_the_Mat">Jake The Snake Roberts smoke crack on film</a>. I don't really keep up with it anymore, but it's relaxing and familiar, and that makes it just right for this morning's pre-caffeinated period.</p>
<p>So, a wrestling-themed link trail:</p>

<li><a class="reference external" href="http://social.chass.ncsu.edu/wyrick/debclass/rbwres.htm">Roland Barthes' ur-analysis of professional wrestling</a>. You've probably already read it. If not, you should.</li>
<li>A few years ago the Village Voice <a class="reference external" href="http://www.villagevoice.com/arts/0502,lagorio,59937,12.html">surveyed</a> the state of academic inquiry into the field and asked (among other things), &quot;[shouldn't wrestling] stand for [labor] unions?&quot;</li>

                    <p>You're probably pretty sick of reading posts from me that start off by complaining about how far behind on everything I am. So am I, for what it's worth. But a lot happened over the course of the ten days when I was gone, and I feel like I need to sift through it if I'm ever going to return to the state of continuous partial attention that I left.</p>
<p>It's tempting to just hit &quot;mark all as read&quot; on every feed in my reader, but I'd be a real jerk if I didn't point out that my friends did a lot of cool stuff while I was gone (or while I was too busy preparing to leave to link to anything). So, a few plaudits. If I left your amazing accomplishment off, well, I guess I'm still a jerk. I promise I'll write about it as soon as I read about it.</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first"><a class="reference external" href="http://dccharles.blogspot.com/2007/03/weekend-affair.html">Charles recorded an album</a>! I got to witness the break-neck pace at which they threw this thing together. Their devotion to the process was impressive, but hearing Aaron sing the same apparently atonal chorus a million times left me gritting my teeth for an irritating final product. But I was pleasantly surprised — I think that this is the best stuff I've ever heard these two guys record (they collaborated with Bayes, but I've never heard anything he recorded). If you haven't gotten around to downloading the whole thing from Charles' site, here's a flash player that should let you pick and choose from the tracks. I'd suggest starting with track 7 — it's got a an impressively catchy (and New York-y) guitar hook that'll burrow straight into your cochlea and stay there.</p>

<li><p class="first">Congratulations to <a class="reference external" href="http://twotimingthecosmos.blogspot.com/">Heather</a> for putting together <a class="reference external" href="http://dc.metblogs.com/archives/2007/03/dcist_exposed_h.phtml">DCist Exposed</a>, which by all accounts was an enormous success. I haven't made it down to Warehouse yet to check out the photos, but I intend to tonight. Way to go.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Sommer <a class="reference external" href="http://www.myfoxdc.com/myfox/MyFox/pages/sidebar_video.jsp?contentId=2655475&amp;version=1&amp;locale=EN-US">was interviewed by Fox 5</a> for their &quot;Blogapalooza&quot; feature and handled the ridiculous premise with grace, walking the line perfectly between promoting DCist and being impolite to her interviewer.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Spencer's in motherfucking IRAQ! And he's issuing excellent dispatches <a class="reference external" href="http://toohotfortnr.blogspot.com/">here</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.iraqslogger.com/index.php/writer/33/Spencer_Ackerman">there</a>, and allegedly in various print outlets (paper is deprecated). I can't wait until he's safely home and the backlog of morbid jokes can be unleashed. In the meantime, go read his stuff. Hanging out with Spencer and witnessing the gallons of boundless energy that pour from him every second makes it easy to forget what a great writer he is. But god damn! Not only is he putting his ass on the line, he's wringing an amazing amount of <a class="reference external" href="http://toohotfortnr.blogspot.com/2007/03/ten-seconds-to-love.html">humor</a> from a dangerous and difficult assignment.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Speaking of my writerly friends, Kriston's got articles <a class="reference external" href="http://grammarpolice.net/archives/001242.php">all over the place</a>. I hear the Guardian is opening a Florida Avenue bureau.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Yglesias doesn't write about the news, he <a class="reference external" href="http://amconmag.com/2007/2007_03_12/article.html">makes</a> the goddamn news.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Rounding out the flophouse's journalistic successes, Catherine's Washingtonian blog is off to a <a class="reference external" href="http://washingtonian.com/blogs/afterhours/index.html">great start</a>. Be sure to check out the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/medildo/413836120/">glamor shot</a> from her photostream of the Washingtonian web team. They look like they're promoting their new Fox show about doctor-cops who are also lawyers, yet find time to have complex romantic lives. William Shatner guest stars as the curmudgeonly but lovable Garrett Graff.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Finally (because it's actually happening in the future), <a class="reference external" href="http://wryandstanley.blogspot.com/">Ray</a>'s playing a show at DC9 on Sunday. I've seen <a class="reference external" href="http://www.myspace.com/trmnsprx">his band</a> before (at the Grog, no less) and can vouch for 'em. I intend to be there on Sunday; you should, too.</p>

                    <p>I don't know if anyone else has stumbled across the <a class="reference external" href="http://dsc.discovery.com/fansites/manvswild/manvswild.html?dcitc=w99-502-ah-1002">Man Vs. Wild</a> marathon that Discovery played tonight, but if you haven't seen the show I recommend you track it down and give it a few Tivo thumbs-up. It's a survival show hosted by an ex-special forces <a class="reference external" href="http://dsc.discovery.com/fansites/manvswild/manvswild.html?dcitc=w99-502-ah-1002">badass</a> (but he's British, so he's charming). Tonight I got to watch him rip the meat from a zebra carcass with his teeth and squeeze life-sustaining water from elephant droppings directly into his mouth. Seriously! And that was just one episode!</p>
<p>Anyway, if you've got an inner boy scout you should really check this out. It makes that <a class="reference external" href="http://science.discovery.com/convergence/survivorman/survivorman.html">Survivor Man</a> dude — who is admittedly awesome in his own right — come off like that weirdo who keeps spending his family's savings on anti-bear suits that the military then refuses to buy.</p>

                    <p>A little while ago I wrote a <a class="reference external" href="/2007/01/26/fighting-movable-type-comment-spam-part-1/">series of posts</a> outlining some steps that Movable Type admins can take to cut down on the comment spam they receive. I didn't promote it — I probably will later, in a different context — and it didn't receive a lot of traffic.</p>
<p>But it sure does get a lot of attempted spam, at least relative to all of the other entries on the site. I can only think of a few explanations:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>The spammers are searching for anti-spam entries and specifically going after them to discredit their contents.</li>
<li>Maybe spammers search for anti-spam entries to serve as test beds for their methods.</li>
<li>Someone doesn't like me and signed me up for a list of URLs that's frequently spammed.</li>
<li>... Or it's just random.</li>
</ol>
<p>It's weird. Fortunately the anti-spam stuff is holding up — this morning is the first time that any got through (that I can remember, anyway), and only two comments made it before the URL rotated and it all stopped.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>There was a lot of good swag at SXSW, most of it in the form of promotional trinkets that a self-describedly net savvy individual such as myself will proudly add to the constellation of brands that define his persona, despite their uncaring and inhuman nature (they would take our blood if it could be used to cool CPUs). In fact, I'm wearing a <a class="reference external" href="http://pipes.yahoo.com">Yahoo Pipes</a> t-shirt right now. Capitalism works!</p>
<p>I didn't realize it at the time, but the best or at least most interesting swag came in the tote bag that every attendee received. For one thing, there was the pin from <a class="reference external" href="http://www.makezine.com">MAKE Magazine</a> that I cherish but have already almost managed to destroy. But this curiousity was even more striking:</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/421764736/"><img alt="a picture of a packet of nicogel hand gel. smokers are supposed to rub it into their hands to alleviate cravings." class="center" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/183/421764736_2be07ae9d0.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>I didn't have the guts to try it, but <a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/people/blturner/">Ben</a> did. &quot;My hands feel <em>great</em>,&quot; he said, after an initial period of wondering whether it would do anything. &quot;They're all cool and relaxed.&quot; Presumably this was menthol Nicogel.</p>
<p>I'd try it, but I'm too chicken — I feel like I use my hands an awful lot. So I've given it to Charles, who seems to be in the Nicogel's target market. Hopefully he'll give it a shot and report back.</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/421773474/"><img alt="an issue of Wizard Magazine" class="right" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/129/421773474_5a7e313145_m.jpg" /></a>Even better, though, was the unassuming inclusion of a copy of Wizard, which was one of many magazines in the packet (Linux Journal is really good!). Any other nerds reading this will probably be familiar with Wizard. During our childhood it served primarily as a price guide for comics, reporting made-up numbers that were supposed to chart a complex economy defined by two whole companies and a million parents' basements. It always sounded like an interesting thing to read, and sort of was — until you realized that reading actual comic books was way more fun than reading meta comic books.</p>
<p>Nowadays it's a bit glossier and more accessible. In this issue, at least, there are a lot of two-page spreads devoted to essays on things like &quot;What's in store for the X-Men in 2007?&quot; They get quotes from comic writers and artists, and everyone talks about the characters as if they were real people (just like in Soap Opera Digest, if the covers are any indication). It certainly helped me figure out some of the gibberish that Kriston and Matt have been spouting the last few months. I may even make the effort and <a class="reference external" href="http://isohunt.com/download/16530435/punisher+war+journal+3">catch</a> <a class="reference external" href="http://jomic.sourceforge.net/">up</a> with this whole &quot;Civil War&quot; storyline.</p>
<p>But Wizard is no longer just about comics. They've also branched out into the wider geek world. And although they're not the greatest interviewers in the world, the writers proceed with an entertaining lack of pretension. Let's be honest: nobody gives a fuck what a producer from Lost thinks about mythological archetypes. They just want to know who the Others are, and when Kate and Sawyer are going to do it. Wizard is sensitive to this fact. Every question in every interview could be rewritten as, &quot;No, seriously, give us some spoilers.&quot; It's great.</p>
<p>And in this issue there is, in fact, an interview about Lost. It's with David Lindelof, one of the show's creators. You can find it <a class="reference external" href="http://www.wizarduniverse.com/television/lost/002870368.cfm?page=1">here</a>, and it's wonderful. Not because it contains any satisfying revelations about the plot — it doesn't reveal anything. But at the very end it officially releases Lost dead-enders like myself from the show's infuriating grip:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><strong>Youâ€™ve said that there is a sort of five-season plan in place for &quot;Lost.&quot; Are you guys still on track for that plan?</strong></div>
<div class="line">Did I say that?</div>
<div class="line"><strong>I think you said it...</strong></div>
<div class="line">I think thatâ€™s one of those things that has been attributed to me that no one has actually said. There have been sort of vague questions as to how much story we have or what the plan is, and I think that the only thing that Iâ€™ve ever said on the record is that if we were in a position to actually end the show on our own terms, that it would probably be at the end of four years. That would be the ultimate nexus point for the show. But unfortunately, itâ€™s completely moot whether itâ€™s four years or five years or seven years, because I donâ€™t own the show and [co-creator and executive producer] J.J. [Abrams] doesnâ€™t own the show and [executive producer] Carlton [Cuse] doesnâ€™t own the show - Touchstone and ABC own the show. And as long as itâ€™s a show that is popular and that people are watching, theyâ€™ll never let us end it, which is sad and depressing.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>There you have it: confirmation of the show's inevitable X-Filesification. The only thing you can do is stop watching, then swoop back in when its cancellation has been announced. Thank you, Wizard.</p>
<p>And thank you for tricking Emily into reading you. Guys, how many times have you been asked to analogize Marvel vs. DC to Playstation vs. Xbox? I don't even think she was asking it sarcastically. Not entirely, anyway.</p>

                    <p>A promise is a promise, even if no one particularly cares. Here's that DHTML similarity matrix <a class="reference external" href="/2007/03/02/keeping-promises/">I promised</a>. I haven't done much cross-browser testing, but in Firefox at least you should now be able to see which state delegation are the most homogenous* and which are the most loyal to their party. The results won't shock you (Californians are better Democrats than Kansans!?!!), but it's nice to see that my math seems to be correct.</p>
<p>Now that I'm home (and Southby preparations are over with) I can devote some more time to this Sunlight Foundation contest. I've got a few ideas and a bunch of very good leads courtesy of <a class="reference external" href="http://bayes.wordpress.com/">son1</a>. The deadline isn't until mid-April — I think I should definitely be able to come up with something cool by then.</p>

                    <p>Visiting Austin and California was great, but it's a relief to be home. The last ten days have been busy ones, and I'm feeling the effects. I did manage to finally kick my traditional month-long spring cold, but my shoes <a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/421204130/">weren't up</a> to the amount of walking that a party-filled conference and unexplored city demanded: my legs ache and I feel pretty worn down.</p>
<p>For a conference about the internet I spent surprisingly little time online: electrical outlets were precious commodities, and although the organizers made an admirable attempt, the Southby wifi left a lot to be desired. So I'm slowly, painfully reimmersing myself in the internet, as if it's a scalding-hot bath. Eventually I'll be relaxed, reengaged and recovered, but for right now the 1,324 unread RSS items staring at me from NetNewsWire are more than a little intimidating.</p>
<p>I've got to tie a few more things up over at the <a class="reference external" href="http://sxsw.echoditto.com">EchoDitto SXSW blog</a>, but later on I'll start putting stuff up here. For now, here's my collection of SXSW photos — I'll probably elaborate on the better ones later on, but at the moment I need to put these up so that I can steal the generated HTML and cross-post it to the EchoDitto blog.</p>

                    <p>I said I'd have a similarity matrix for you, didn't I? Well, here it is.</p>
<p><img alt="congressional similarity matrix" class="center" src="/static/2007/03/02/20070302_similarity_matrix_color.png" style="width: 439px; height: 439px;" /></p>
<p>The Sunlight Foundation is holding a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.sunlightfoundation.com/mashups">mashup contest</a>, and I've been screwing around with the data they've made available on <a class="reference external" href="http://www.opencongress.org">opencongress.org</a> to see if there's anything cool that I can do with it.</p>
<p>I started off by scraping every member of congress's voting record, then running a comparison of how similar they were (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/44137303&#64;N00/406129174">this photo</a> wasn't taken just because I'm pretentious — I had another reason, too). This graph is sort of my way of checking my work so far: it orders members by party, then state, then district. So the block in the upper left represents the democrats, and the one in the lower right is the republicans. The diagonal white line represents where each member is plotted against themselves (they'll always have an identical record, of course, so it's worth blanking this out to show that it isn't valuable data). The brighter the color, the more similar the voting record.</p>
<p>Of course, some members are too new to have cast enough votes to make analyzing them worthwhile, and I haven't bothered to filter them out yet (hence the scattered black dots). And this isn't the interface I intend to use for this data — it's static and visually boring, and unlikely to wow any judges.</p>
<p>But it's still kind of interesting, and you can draw a few conclusions from it (many of which are easier to see in the black &amp; white version, behind the jump). For one thing, you can see that the republicans vote like one another more consistently than the democrats do — as a result, their block is darker (on the black &amp; white graph; it's brighter on the color version, but it's a little hard to compare red pixels to blue ones directly due to how our eyes work). For another, you can see that the bands of dissimilar color are often a few pixels wide (again, particularly among the democrats). These correlate to particular states' delegations that tend to vote unlike their parties. Unsurprisingly, these tend to be folks like Iowa democrats and Texas republicans.</p>
<p>Those are just my initial impressions, though, and I could be misinterpreting something. Tomorrow I'll put up a simple DHTML browser that lets you see which column belongs to which legislator. That should make it easier to see whatever glaring mistakes I've made.</p>

I was all set to lapse into ArcadeFirecentricity, with only an occasional <a class="reference external" href="http://www.movering.com/node/329">Swimmers</a> song breaking the monotony of my non-ticket-having despair. But then all of a sudden <a class="reference external" href="http://unitedhates.blogspot.com/">my sister</a> appeared with AF tickets, and I unexpectedly found a bunch of other music to be excited about. And the Dismemberment Plan are <a class="reference external" href="http://www.dcist.com/archives/2007/03/01/you_are_invited.php">playing a reunion show</a>! Everything's great!</p>
<p>In fact I just got back from seeing <a class="reference external" href="http://karmellasgame.com/home.html">Karmella's Game</a> at the Black Cat with <a class="reference external" href="http://www.matthewyglesias.com">Yglesias</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://outtamindouttasite.typepad.com">Catherine</a>. It's been years since I last saw KG, but they were just as charming as I remembered — and now they had better songs to back up their overwhelming charisma. I really don't understand why these guys aren't better-known than they are. When a band performs harmonies with as many parts as it has personnel I take it as a very good sign. Well, if they pull it off, anyway, which Karmella's Game did.</p>
<p>So that bring us to this post's first mp3. Have at it (and my apologies to the band for hosting it — I wouldn't have, except your last.fm page is broken):</p>

<p>Moving on! I stumbled upon The Wombats a few days ago. I know that their NME heyday may have already come and gone, but their new EP (leaked in December, apparently) seems stronger to me than their last album (although that's good, too — more mp3s <a class="reference external" href="http://spuckle.blogspot.com/2006/12/wombats-moving-to-new-york.html">here</a>):</p>

<p>Caralyn <a class="reference external" href="http://fillygrrrl.blogspot.com/2007/02/go-download-patrick-wolfs-accident.html">posted</a> about Patrick Wolf's &quot;Accident &amp; Emergency&quot; a while ago, but at the moment I listened to it I was too exhausted/hung over/sick to really fall for it. But the track Stereogum <a class="reference external" href="http://www.stereogum.com/archives/004716.html">posted</a> this week caught me at the right moment, and it made me a believer:</p>
<blockquote>
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.stereogum.com.nyud.net:8080/mp3/Patrick%20Wolf%20-%20The%20Magic%20Position.mp3">Patrick Wolf – The Magic Position</a></blockquote>
<p>And finally, the peak of the mashup fad may have crested, but there's still a lot to be said for combining two guilty pleasures into one plausibly-deniable whole. Check it out:</p>
<blockquote>
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.team9.net.nyud.net:8080/mp3/team9%20-%20When%20you%20were%20a%20starlight.mp3">Team 9 – When You Were Starlight (Killers vs. Muse)</a></blockquote>
<p>Okay! Music over! Tomorrow: Philly Arcade Fire tickets, DC D-Plan tickets, and maybe, MAYBE some graphs of congressional cosine similarity matrices. But only if you're good.</p>

<p>So, I suppose I should have mentioned this earlier, but I'm on the verge of a delirious Western adventure. First! A week of vacation in California. Emily and I are headed to the bay area to hang out with <a class="reference external" href="http://www.jeffnye.org">Jeff</a>, Marie, Chris, Paul, Jon, my aunt &amp; uncle, and the hippies, weirdos, fortune-seekers and drug addicts that power the world's seventh-largest economy.</p>
<p>Second! It's back home via Austin, where we'll rejoin the EchoDitto crew at SXSW Interactive for some good old-fashioned internet fun. Needless to say if any readers, lurkers or inter-friends will be in either area you should send me an email. If you don't have my address, send a blank message to tom&#64;[this domain] to get the real one sent to you (consider it an experiment in spammer-foiling).</p>

People don't want websites to make their browsers work in radically different ways than they normally do. Or at least they don't want them to when everything else seems to be normal. This NYTimes behavior is almost as irritating as the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.snap.com">snap.com</a> preview windows that now pop up by default on every <a class="reference external" href="http://www.wordpress.com">wordpress.com</a> blog.</p>
<p>I imagine that the folks at the Times will come to their senses. But to me the most remarkable part of all of this isn't the stupidity of the &quot;feature&quot; — it's how many people seem to share my affliction. I thought I was the only one who constantly highlighted and rehighlighted text while reading things on the web. But no! It seems that Kriston, <a class="reference external" href="http://toohotfortnr.blogspot.com">Spencer</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.unfogged.com">Ogged</a> all suffer the same compulsion. And who knows how many more suffer in silence? Man. It just feels good to talk about it.</p>
<p>Actually, though, I'm not sure whether I can still count myself among their ranks. I don't remember performing the highlighting tic recently. But I honestly couldn't say whether that's because I've gotten out of the habit or because it's now so automatic for me that I don't notice myself doing it.</p>

                    <p>I've been screwing around with <a class="reference external" href="http://www.processing.org">Processing's</a> video capabilities ever since doing a demo on it during out tech meeting at work a few weeks ago. It's pretty neat, and getting all the neater with the sudden ubiquity of iSight cameras.</p>
<p>I initially thought that there was a somewhat glaring security hole to all of this that would potentially allow a website operator to take snapshots of users without them noticing. Turns out that's not the case: an applet has to be signed in order for the camera libraries to work in a web browser. That means it either needs to come from a very trusted source (say, Sun Microsystems) or the user has to sign off on a security warning.</p>
<p>But even without the potential for sneakiness, this is still pretty neat. Here's a first pass at it that I thought I might as well post online. It's a pretty simple tech demo — it just distorts your image in a fun way. But the potential of the technology is amazing, mostly by virtue of how amazingly accessible it is. If you've got a webcam, click on the image below and say &quot;ok&quot; to the security warning. And don't worry: this applet doesn't send your picture anywhere. That'll be coming in a future blog post (and yes, I'll warn you).</p>
<p>I'm pretty confident that this works OK on Macs, but things may be dicier on Windows. When it comes to Java stuff there's always a chance of unexpected browser crashing, so please don't leave anything important unsaved in any of your other tabs.</p>

I can deal with blogospheric neglect, but not its formalization. But if this is the way it's going to be, I'll at least console myself by indulging in a blogubituary.</p>
<p>Out of everyone in our little corner of the internet, I'd say that Susan managed to get closest to the dignified end of the quality–quantity continuum. But that's not to imply that I think we're playing in a zero-sum game, or on a level field. Do the math and you'll see that Sue could have pretty clearly become an blogospheric titan if only she'd cared to. But reading her site always left me feeling like she was writing it more out of an obligation to her talents than because she loved the medium (and the egocentric gratification it provides). She seemed like some foreign basketball prodigy swept out of rural obscurity and compelled to play a game that her heart wasn't in. If that analogy seems strained, consider that Susan is in fact quite tall.</p>
<p>I remain optimistic that this departure isn't permanent, or is perhaps just being made in favor of more pseudonymous pastures. Either way, do yourself a favor and go <a class="reference external" href="http://sueandnotu.blogspot.com/">page through some archives</a>.</p>

                    <p>So look, cut me some slack. It's been a rough week: between work trauma and being sick enough to miss a full day of work for the first time in I don't know how long, this wasn't very bloggy week for me. Well, not here, anyway; I was happy to pursue titillating inquiries into American Idol contestants over at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.dcist.com/archives/2007/02/23/the_districts_i.php">DCist</a>.</p>
<p>I <em>did</em> manage to fail to implement a cool webcam thing I was working on, as well as managing to not get Arcade Fire tickets (iCal reminders don't work, apparently). I know, quite a week.</p>
<p>But I didn't just sit around complaining! I did other things, too. Ever since <a class="reference external" href="http://www.jeffnye.org">Jeff</a> <a class="reference external" href="/2006/11/30/well-im-sick/#comments">told me</a> that my beloved zinc tables were probably destroying my brain I've been looking for a new pseudoscientific way to recover from colds. But nothing plausible and affordable had come along, and I was ill again — I found myself lowering my standards. I was getting sicker and more suggestible by the day.</p>
<p>That's when I heard <a class="reference external" href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=7108546&amp;ft=1&amp;f=3">this</a> NPR report. Nasal irrigation? Sure! Why not?</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/403040010/"><img alt="dr. somethingorother's nasal rinse" class="center" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/128/403040010_51bb3db5c0.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>So yes, the deal is that you squirt warm, salty water up your nose. And yes, I realize that this may seem kind of embarrassing and gross. But the NPR people made it sound great! I was convinced that if I took this one simple step I would feel refreshed and recovered; have a more resonant, stentorian voice; and might attain a new level of consciousness and/or be able to shoot bolts of energy from my fingertips. It'd be like Scientology, except available at CVS. At the very least I wouldn't have to sniffle and sneeze quite as much. That was the hope, anyway. But you don't have to take my word for these incredible benefits — just look how happy the girl on the box is:</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/403040609/"><img alt="a young girl with a nasal rinse bottle jammed up her nose. she seems happy" class="center" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/141/403040609_95b500a8d2.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Well, I tried it. The actual experience was less unpleasant than you might expect. But aside from the fulfillment of that promise, it's a total crock. I didn't feel any better immediately afterward, and the next day things had actually gotten quite a bit worse. Maybe I should have taken the box's entreaties that I boil the District's tap water a bit more seriously.</p>
<p>Anyway, it may be unrelated, but I currently have no sense of smell. It's a little weird — I can breathe perfectly normally, but I can't smell anything at all. Waving a bottle of scotch under my nose produces absolutely no effect, and I was only able to tell that I was in a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.philadelphiaweekly.com/view.php?id=12253">smoky bar</a> by virtue of my watering eyes.</p>
<p>I'm confident that my sense of smell will eventually come back, but for now it's sort of neat to be working solely off of my sense of taste. Things are salty, sweet, sour or bitter, and that's about it. Food's a little boring, but the cheapest booze at a bar now tastes the same as top shelf. Call it a wash.</p>

                    <p>Sick days: not as bad as they could be. It's true that I still sort of feel like I'm breathing through a tiny, phlegmy drinking straw. But there's a lot to be said for spending a day in your pajamas a scant few feet from a chocolate cake. Plus I got kind of a lot of work done. It's really made me miss the heady days of telecommuting to my considerably stupider but also more hygiene-optional last job.</p>
<p>But all's not well in the world. I'll issue this qualification: I really like the stuff that <a class="reference external" href="http://www.brightestyoungthings.com/">BYT</a>/<a class="reference external" href="http://www.myspace.com/garutachi">Garutachi</a> is doing — seems decidedly too cool for the likes of me, but I'm glad there's a distinct party scene in this city that's concerned with things other than <a class="reference external" href="http://wonkette.com/politics/last-week's-shots/">date rape and boat shoes</a>. Still, I wasn't pleased to see <a class="reference external" href="http://wonkette.com/photogallery/garutachi/">this</a>. I find it extremely depressing that the only thing still keeping DC safely out of <a class="reference external" href="http://gawker.com/news/blue-states-lose/">Blue States Lose</a> eligibility is the fact that we're not a state.</p>

                    <p>Saturday night was astoundingly great. Earlier in the week Josh asked me if I might like to dress up like a superhero and stand around an Arlington TV studio for a few hours. Clearly the answer was yes.</p>
<p>So two nights ago Emily and I joined Josh and Lindsay at Galaxy Hut before heading a few doors down to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.arlingtonmedia.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=12&amp;Itemid=257">channel 69</a> to be extras in the next episode of <a class="reference external" href="http://channel102.net/show.php?show=88">Defenders of Stan</a>.</p>
<p>Getting a bunch of people dressed up like superheroes is an excellent way to start an evening. And Arlington's small-world tendencies made the evening even better: <a class="reference external" href="http://dcist.com/staff.php#hemal">Hemal</a> and her sister Payal were there, and I was pleasantly surprised to see <a class="reference external" href="http://www.thelegwarmers.com/jr.asp">HT</a> in a jaunty cape — I've known the guy off and on since taking computer classes at the Career Center together, where he and I acquired the advanced Applesoft BASIC skills that eventually led him to work with my friend <a class="reference external" href="http://www.mp3.com/users/Jon47/profile.php">Jon</a>. Like I said, Arlington's a small world. A small, inbred world.</p>
<p>The shoot was pretty fun, particularly since Josh made an in-costume run to Whole Foods for beer. After things wrapped up we tried to head back to Galaxy Hut, but they looked a little crowded and were charging a cover. So Josh continued his streak of real-life heroism and drove us all into the city to meet up with folks at Townhouse. I stopped taking photos at that point; Kriston's photostream <a class="reference external" href="http://flickr.com/photos/cappseus/395804032/">picks up</a> the <a class="reference external" href="http://flickr.com/photos/cappseus/395803956/">story</a> from there.</p>
<p>But here are the shots I did get:</p>

<p>And thanks &amp; congratulations to Kyle and Amanda for putting the concert together. I'm consistently amazed that people I know manage to put together such great rock shows. Their ability to identify bands at the sweet spot between popularity and bookability; get people in the door; make them feel like they got their money's worth; and have the bands leave happy — well, it's impressive. And for sub-$10 shows, it's surprisingly rare.</p>
