<li><p class="first">Slate has <a class="reference external" href="http://www.slate.com/id/2169863/nav/tap1/">an article</a> with a bunch of good links to other stories explaining why we should be dubious of carbon offset traders. I guess I'm probably behind on all of this, but I found it interesting and, as someone who's at least had offsets purchased on their behalf, personally relevant. The upshot seems to be that you can't just buy $1 worth of carbon non-release. Your money's actually pushing the margins of where it makes sense for companies to implement clean technologies — projects that they were considering doing for reasons unrelated to climate change. It's not clear whether traders are doing a good job of actually getting the money where it can best tip those scales, though, or whether it's just a case of a smattering of environmentally beneficial projects having their profit margins inflated at random. It's also unclear how much of the transaction the brokers are pocketing.</p>

<li><p class="first">Speaking of Slate, good lord but <a class="reference external" href="http://www.slate.com/id/2169929/nav/tap3/">this</a> is a bad article. Who could possibly think that a series of passive-aggressive letters from a landlord to her tenants would be funny or interesting to anyone except the embittered property owner? Even more astounding: there's a podcast version.</p>

<li><p class="first">Via <a class="reference external" href="http://torrentfreak.com/">TorrentFreak</a> I see that <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nypost.com/seven/07082007/business/sprint_takes_lead_as_1st_sponsor_of_file_share_song_business_peter_lauria.htm">Sprint is going to start spamming P2P users</a>, embedding advertising in some dude named Plies' tracks, which they'll then blanket filesharing networks with. Details seem a bit scarce, but odds are that they'll just be throwing the Sprint logo into the ID3v2 metadata sections of the tracks (or whatever the equivalent is for AAC). It's an interesting idea, but I have a hard time imagining it's a strategy that would be worth pursuing if not for the one-time earned media that its inventiveness is garnering.</p>

The screen had been misbehaving for a while, occasionally displaying useless garbage instead of meaningful content like Twitter messages about what people in California had for dinner. Flipping the screen up and down usually solved the problem, but not anymore. First it was stuck as gibberish; now it just doesn't show anything. I'm stuck with the aged t39m (monochrome!) pictured on the right.</p>
<p>So I guess I'd better get a new phone, huh? The iPhone's appearance is a little too recent, and my need to pay $200 to cancel a contract (I have two T-Mobile accounts thanks to LastCall) means that it's out of my price range. Besides, I don't want to have to compete with Yglesias in the making-hilarious-observations-about-iPhone-quirks game.</p>
<p>Right now I think I'll follow through on my threats to get an Ocean, even though <a class="reference external" href="http://mstem.wordpress.com/">Matt's</a> review has been lukewarm. The platform's locked down in the same way as the Sidekick, and it's clear there are some problems that future firmware upgrades will have to be used to work out. But mostly it looks like what the Sidekick 3 should have been, except with a lousier keyboard. The lack of an SSH client gives me pause — it's pretty awesome to fix a website from your phone — but I imagine I can work out some horribly-insecure alternative with an IM interface or a Java applet. I plan commandeer my officemates' phones tomorrow — as a web developer I'm officially sanctioned with that power, and both the iPhone and Ocean are represented — then I guess I'll take the plunge.</p>
<p>Unless someone tells me that's a horrible idea, of course. Anybody?</p>
<p><strong>OH YEAH:</strong> I should point out that although my venerable t39m is an excellent phone, it's a terrible everything else. So don't send me text messages until I get this worked out, if you don't mind — there's pretty much no chance I'll retrieve them on this thing.</p>

                    <p>Ladies and gentlemen, the Porters. We're freshly back from Andy and Lee Ann's wedding in lovely Winchester, Va. The bride was radiant, the groom was handsome, and no fights broke out. Well, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/757216202/">almost</a> no fights.</p>
<p>This wedding is sort of a milestone for my group of friends, I suppose. It's certainly not the first, but I think it is the first that didn't owe part of its timing to a pending deployment to Afghanistan, an INS scam or a raging Mormon libido. Not that those aren't all fine reasons to push up the date of nuptuals, but none of them apply to me, particularly. As far as I could see, though, this whole operation was uncoerced! Weird.</p>
<p>A <a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/757253254/">beautiful setting</a> and an awesome band made for a fun reception. Then everyone came back to the hotel and got drunk in our room, which was also pretty great. And about an hour ago I wrapped things up by buying an ionic air purifier off the registry: an electronic gadget the coolness of which is only outstripped by its potential uselessness. It's exactly the sort of gift I'd like to be associated with, and a storybook ending to the weekend. I hope it brings them many a happy ion.</p>

<p>Ah, frisbee golf — or, more properly, &quot;disc golf&quot;, as it's called by people sufficiently obsessed with it that Whammo suing one of their clubs or tournaments is a real possibility. Charles and I used to play all the time in high school, along with Jeff, Chris, Jon and Mark Zuckerman and whoever else was handy. It was cheap, vaguely outdoorsy and pretty fun. And <a class="reference external" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=l&amp;view=text&amp;q=601+noth+manchester+street&amp;near=Arlington,+VA&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hl=en&amp;latlng=38873065,-77134417,6954809954099064469&amp;ei=g4OORuaGOorerQK_op20AQ&amp;cd=1">Bluemont</a> has one of the best courses in the area, although the first three holes are a bit overgrown at the moment. Head over to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.casualadventure.com/index2.shtml">Casual Adventure</a>, pick up a couple of discs and go play. It's only approximately as dorky as you think. Avoid the weird middle-aged dudes sporting frisbee bags and invitations to their mothers' basements and you'll have a pretty good time.</p>

                    <p>I'm not dead, although I am working from home today after some stomach weirdness brought my attendance at my buddy Andy's bachelor party last night to an abrupt conclusion. This is only the second bachelor party I've attended, and although I had to go home before I got a chance to have unpleasantly oily ladies cavort in front of me, it was still more debauched than the first: we continued the trend of eating pizza and playing video games, but the beverage of choice this time was BEER. The first such party just featured Dr. Pepper (the groom was Mormon, though, so this was pretty transgressive at the time).</p>

<li>Oink.me.uk, the incredibly comprehensive BT music site, isn't down, it's just <a class="reference external" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Torrentfreak/~3/129433734/">experiencing DNS issues</a>. Some folks thought the legal hammer had come down on them, particularly since some other high profile sites (most notably Demonoid) have recently gotten the axe. Not so; if you need to, you can still access the site by its IP using information at the above link.</li>
<li>AllOfMP3, the quasi-legal bulk MP3 site that traded off a loophole in Russian copyright law, <a class="reference external" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/boingboing/iBag/~3/129852366/allofmp3com_finally_.html">appears to be dead</a>, a casualty of Russia's stepped-up efforts to comply with international IP treaties. However it's already sprung up under a new name — MP3Sparks — and brought over customers' accounts and balances. I've successfully used AllOfMP3 in the past and been pleased with the experience. Better still, I haven't been murdered or sold into slavery by the Russian mafia. All in all, a better experience than anticipated.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://apple.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/07/02/1642242&amp;from=rss">Universal is pulling their music off of iTunes</a>, or at least threatening to. Folks are speculating that this is because Apple has been unwilling to budge on various issues, the most notable being the 99 cent pricing for songs.</li>
</ul>
<p>And finally, TorrentFreak <a class="reference external" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Torrentfreak/~3/128633142/">notes</a> that the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.piratebay.org">Pirate Bay</a> is responsible for 50% of all BT traffic, which is fairly astounding.</p>

                    <p>Emily and I are in Cazenovia for the weekend, barely. Decades of inbreeding and exposure to elevated levels of cosmic radiation have finally taken their toll on the men and women of the US airline industry: it appears that we're in the waning days of air travel. Our flight was delayed — everyone's flight was delayed. Time lost its meaning, the captain sang the Flipper theme song to us over the intercom, and everyone was inexplicably wearing shorts. The situation is very bad. And as unpleasant as it was to get to bed at 4AM, our ordeal will no doubt pale in comparison to that of the poor soulds who'll be flying after us. God help you all.</p>
<p>Still, there were some bright spots during our time at BWI. First, there was this:</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/663553496/"><img alt="I'd rather be seen reading High Times" class="center" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1068/663553496_3793413541.jpg" style="width: 375px; height: 500px;" /></a></p>
<p>I really can't think of a lifestyle more debauched than driving your boat around, pickin' up boat groupies. It's as if on the last day of 1979 all the swingers were rounded up and banished forever from dry land.</p>
<p>But — speaking of deviancy — the more interesting sighting was a real life Ron Pa/ul supporter:</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/662702991/"><img alt="the Ron Paul REVOLUTION" class="center" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1070/662702991_6ee292e6b6.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: 375px;" /></a></p>
<p>He was accompanied by a profoundly androgenous brother sporting a Mao bag/women's-cut pinstripe jacket combo, and a paunchy father who presumably could have done more. But of course the most striking thing was the t-shirt, the back of which featured the URL of ronpa/ulhq.com, your and my unofficial center for Ron Pa/ul advocacy. Could this young man be part of the legions of Ron Pa/ul enthusiasts (&quot;Paul Bearers&quot;?) whose internet evangelism has put Paul into solid contention for the MySpace vote, and prompted National Journal to enthusiastically declare, &quot;<a class="reference external" href="http://wonkette.com/politics/dept%27-of-second-life-same-as-the-first/national-journal-would-like-you-ron-paul-fanatics-to-knock-it-off-266610.php">Please stop emailing us</a>&quot;?</p>
<p>It seems likely. There was definitely a wild quality about him — an ungroomed Van Dyke on his chin, a flash in his eyes, and a threateningly big class ring on his knuckles — that evoked the mix of iconoclasm and feverish irrationality that necessarily define a political candidate hellbent on dismantling the government.</p>
<p>More disturbingly, I watched him use an actual, honest-to-god pay phone — twice! Now sure, not everyone can afford a cell phone. But this guy and his family looked solidly middle class, and I'm pretty sure his dad had a phone clipped to his belt. Could he just not be trusted to borrow it? Had dad received one too many expensive cellular bills filled with cold-calls to Iowa on Dr. Pa/ul's behalf? Or is it simply that a court-ordered psychological evaluation had barred him from cell phone use? Whatever it was, I'm glad that we're unlikely to cross paths again (except perhaps in Second Life).</p>

                    <p>Check out the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/06/27/kevin-roses-new-startup-pownce/">TechCrunch writeup</a> of Kevin Rose's new venture, Pownce. I am, of course, insanely jealous of Kevin for his wild success with thebroken, AOTS and Digg. But despite my petty predisposition, this looks like a winner to me. Here's the comment I left at TechCrunch:</p>
<blockquote>
This is Twitter, plus Dave Winerâ€™s currently-gestating <a class="reference external" href="http://www.twittergram.com/">TwitterGram</a> concept. I wonder how useful segmenting out events and links will be, though, versus just using general text tweeting for it. If thereâ€™s calendar software integration or an RSVPing mechanism, I could see it being very useful. For links maybe not as much, but Iâ€™m sure some social bookmark tie-ins would make it at least interesting (and Iâ€™m sure thereâ€™ll be Digg integration).</blockquote>
<p>The interface looks a <em>lot</em> like <a class="reference external" href="http://iconfactory.com/software/twitterrific">Twitterific</a> to me, and I think it could be extremely appealing to people who are addicted to Facebook feeds (i.e. everyone I know).</p>
<p>It doesn't seem like anything particularly ground-breaking, but the more I think about it the more exciting it seems. If asking people to a spur-of-the-moment happy hour (and getting a headcount for it) is as simple as using Twitterific — that is, you hit a hotkey, type in a message and hit send — it could be genuinely useful. It's much too early to say for sure, of course, but it all strikes me as being very promising.</p>
<p>One criticism, though: he should've named it pwnce.</p>
<p><strong>FOR THE GEEKS:</strong> This could also make for an even better bareknuckle cage match with Twitter than I first thought: they're running their website on Django, a Python framework created by Adrian Holovaty. Twitter's website, on the other hand, is the web's biggest Ruby On Rails application, and has become well-known for being at the forefront of figuring out how to make RoR scale — this is the sort of stuff <a class="reference external" href="http://www.al3x.net">Al3x</a> works on (and gets interviewed about) on a day to day basis. RoR-haters frequently point to Django as a comparable framework that doesn't have Rails' efficiency problems. So! This will be a nice head-to-head matchup of competing technologies.</p>
<p>Of course, there's no clear indication that Pownce's messaging engine is also written in Python (Twitter's is written in Ruby). And there's also no real proof that they'll be a direct competitor to Twitter, in that we don't know whether Pownce will integrate with IM, SMS and other interfaces the way Twitter does (that could ultimately be a boon to them, though, since they won't have to burn through capital buying everyone free SMSes).</p>

First, because it ends on this brazen note:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Ms. Charles has come to think that if this case forces Edâ€™s Lobster Bar to change until it no longer resembles Pearl Oyster Bar, it could be the most influential thing she has ever done.</div>
<div class="line">&quot;I thought if I could have success with this lawsuit, that could be an important contribution,&quot; she said. &quot;If some guy in California is having problems, he could go to his lawyer and look at this case and say, 'Maybe we can do something about it.' &quot;</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>That's right — you'll be doing a <strong>huge</strong> favor to humanity by bringing IP litigation to the world of foodservice in order to protect your business's margins. Thanks a ton, really. But a word of advice: they say it hurts your chances if you campaign for the Nobel outright.</p>
<p>Second, there's the article itself, which completely ignores the well-settled legal questions involved. The closest the article comes to saying &quot;recipes absolutely, unequivocally cannot be copyrighted&quot; (as it ought to) is quoting another restaurant owner who laments, &quot;You canâ€™t protect recipes, you canâ€™t protect what a place looks like, itâ€™s impossible.&quot; That makes it sound like the system is stacked against him protecting his rights — instead of the system explicitly saying he can't assert IP rights over other people's cooking, which is the <em>actual</em> situation. And for what it's worth, the article implies that trademark law <em>can</em> protect what a place looks like — I'm pretty sure that's right, the McDonald's clone in <a class="reference external" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094898/">Coming To America</a> notwithstanding.</p>
<p>All of this ignores the public domain innovations that Ms. Charles benefits from, royalty-free: the cocktails her bartenders serve, the system of reservation-making she presumably employs, and, most amazingly, the Caesar Salad recipe that she says her mother got from another restaurant, but <em>which she's now suing her sous chef for using</em>. Diffuse borrowing seems to be okay; borrowing too much from one place isn't, I guess. But where do you draw the line?</p>
<p>The story mentions that nondisclosure agreements are coming to more and more kitchens, but fails to point out why this is: as screwed-up as our IP system is, it actually dealt with these questions before the food industry was sufficiently powerful to corrupt the process. That's why lawyers are now trying to shove all of this stuff into contract law, where you can get away with <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clickwrap_agreement">much more</a>. In other words: it's because the sorts of claims Ms. Charles is making are untenable under IP law.</p>
<p>There's no question that the sous chef is being tacky by copying Charles' restaurant, but it would be very silly to open a Pandora's box by punishing him for copying paint colors. IP laws are there to encourage people to make new things; the market's there to get them to make those things <em>better</em>. These distinctions can get blurry in the world of novel cuisine. But restaurants are fundamentally in the business of selling food, not seeking rent on ideas about food. This story is asinine, and Pete Wells would have done better to highlight how stupid everyone involved is being instead of just making the guy getting sued sound like a jerk.</p>

                    <p>They're all over the goddamn place. I'd like to flatter myself by thinking that this is due to the collection of healthy fruits and vegetables that I keep near my desk, making it the workstation in the office that could most easily be confused for a picnic. In truth, it probably has more to do with the heaps of disordered crap and abundant coffee stains that adorn it (FACT: ants are apparently attracted to Charlottesville property tax forms for cars you no longer own).</p>
<p>Lee family wisdom holds that the proper way to deal with ants is to sprinkle boric acid all over the damn place. It's apparently quite deadly to ants, but was invented long ago, well before anyone had come up with the idea that chemicals might be bad for humans. So it's perfectly safe to liberally douse, say, newborn infants with it in order to afford some anti-ant protection.</p>
<p>Unfortunately boric acid — like laudanum, sulfuric acid and egg cremes — appears to be one of those awesome substances that drug stores used to sell back in the day, but have since ceased to carry in order to free up more shelf space for Swisher Sweets and NASCAR-themed bags of Cracker Jack. So I'm stuck with more contemporary ant remediation options, which suck pretty badly. In the past I've tried the little black plastic gadgets with gobs of poisoned peanut butter in them. They seem to work, but only after months of patient watchfulness — I think it amounts to ant asbestos, only manifesting its deadliness ant-years after the initial exposure, and well after they've already produced offspring. I suspect that it's actually a breakdown in ant society caused by skyrocketing healthcare costs that makes the stuff work at all. Alternately, it may just be that winter rolls around and they decide that the whole exchange has been so embarrassing that they'd prefer to bother a more dignified target come springtime.</p>
<p>The situation is further compounded by our office's general eco-friendliness. We do a bunch of work for a prominent purveyor of environmentally-focused household products. I have no idea what their anti-ant products are — tiny, alluring decoys shaped like lady ants and made out of hemp, perhaps? A book printed in soy ink on recycled paper entitled &quot;Living with Ants&quot;? — but I'm terrified that if I raise a stink I might be forced to use them.</p>
<p>It's not so bad. They only bite a little.</p>

                    <p>I have to be a little delicate about this: I just got back from a preview of an upcoming environmental documentary by a famous former <em>Growing Pains</em> star/iceberg collision non-survivor. I got to skip out on work to do so — I guess there's a chance we may have some sort of involvement with the project's promotion. I really hope we don't. Nevertheless, discretion is the watchword, lest googling reveal the privately-held opinion of this particular worker bee.</p>
<p>The screening occurred at the MPAA's DC headquarters, which I hadn't realized is mere blocks away. It was kind of awesome being in the belly of the beast. Amusingly enough, the theater boasted what I'm pretty sure was an anti-piracy device: a speaker-looking thing just above the screen with a matrix of of dull red points of light spread across its face. I'm pretty sure those were infrared LEDs, and although I suppose there's a slim chance that they were part of an assistive-audio system, it seems a lot more likely that they were providing non-visible illumination. A camera on the lookout for the bright glare of digital cameras' infra-opaque IR filters would be able to spot a phonecam or mini DV rig easily. So good job on protecting your intellectual property, MPAA! Now just work on getting the projection in focus...</p>
<p>As for the movie — well, I'll start off by saying that I really liked <em>An Inconvenient Truth</em>. It was convincing, affecting and cogently presented. It's clear that LD liked it, too — a lot. But his movie is much, much worse. In fact, if anything it seems likely to provide an excuse for people not to take <em>An Inconvenient Truth</em> seriously.</p>
<p>The film consists of a bunch of talking heads who have been sat down and apparently asked what their eco-grievances are. They ramble in varying directions. Comfortable-looking Californians with &quot;executive director&quot; in their titles tell us that other people need to work and consume and generally want less. Neo-hippies tell us that the solutions to our ecological problems really come down to love, man (this was the first point at which the audience laughed). Somber crackpots explain that the real tragedy won't be the necessary elimination of billions from the earth's population, but rather the non-human species we take with us. Self-assured sophists educate us about how defense spending is an insignificant portion of America's GDP and how no study has ever shown any living system not to be in decline. In between all of this, genuine experts offer genuinely interesting thoughts, which are edited together into incoherence: air pollution's effect on childhood asthma prefaces concern about overfishing; deforestation segues into using fungi for heavy metal mitigation. Accompanying it all: a parade of stock footage, much of it at best tangentially related to the subject currently being discussed (we do get a quick, grainy shot of LD in a sweatlodge, though, which is pretty hilarious).</p>
<p>More than anything, the problem is the writing. LD can't write effective rhetoric for his monologues — he's like Al Gore, except <em>actually</em> boring. And the film is horribly disorganized. It's nothing that a freshman writing seminar or two couldn't fix (although it might require a particularly merciless TA). But as it currently stands, watching the film is like listening to an ecologically-focused 90-minute monologue by A.J. Soprano circa the end of season six.</p>

I'm pretty sure I've seen this before, but had forgotten about it. It's a good list, with one exception:</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>New Radicals:</strong> There are only five facts publicly known about this entity. The first is that 1998â€™s â€œYou Get What You Giveâ€? is an almost flawless Todd Rundgrenâ€“like masterwork that makes any right-thinking American want to run through a Wal-Mart semi-naked. The second is that nobody can remember the singerâ€™s name. The third is that the singer often wore a profoundly idiotic hat. The fourth is that if this anonymous, poorly hatted singer had made a follow-up album, it would have somehow made his first record seem worse. The fifth is that his album didnâ€™t quite deserve to go gold, and it didnâ€™t.</blockquote>
<p>This is wrong, except for the bit about the hat. &quot;You Get What You Give&quot; is abysmal. It's one of those inexplicably ubiquitous songs that force listeners to conclude that the singer must be the son or daughter or lover of a powerful record industry executive. The chorus and the verses blur together, it falls back on percussive vocal delivery to hide how boring the melody is, and the lyrics are intensely banal in the sort of way that only a pop-music sentiment that's a) two decades old and b) <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_End_(The_Beatles_song)">written by Paul McCartney</a> can be. It sounds like Jamiroquai singing tunelessly to himself in the shower and forgetting most of the words. It's really, really bad.</p>
<p>Also, the stupidity of that hat really can't be overstated.</p>

                    <p><a class="reference external" href="http://ezraklein.typepad.com">Ezra</a> used his mastery of the healthcare-related arts to wrangle Emily &amp; me a pair of tickets to Michael Moore's new movie, <em>Sicko</em>. Ezra's going to be seeing it later in the week, I believe, but his his shadow already loomed over the theater: I'm pretty sure I heard someone in the row behind us say his name (although I may have just misheard him asking, &quot;Does this seat recline?&quot;).</p>
<p>The movie was pretty good, but having read enough blogospheric health care wonkery to make me officious-while-not-all-that-well-informed, I also couldn't resist picking out aspects of the film's argument that seemed unsatisfying. Among them: it was hard to know what to make of the anecdotes about care being denied; the trip to Cuba seemed likely to be so staged as to be meaningless; there were no real distinctions made between the different idyllic-seeming foreign healthcare systems; discussions of price were limited to foreign stuff being really cheap and our stuff being really expensive; and despite flirtations with the idea, the movie never really talked about preventive care's effect on cost. Overall, it was a little hard to feel confident about drawing any conclusion other than &quot;America should probably be embarrassed&quot;. Maybe Ezra's <a class="reference external" href="http://www.prospect.org/cs/articles?articleId=12683">Health of Nations</a> article left me expecting too much from a movie that bothered to travel to Canada, the UK and France. Instead of highlighting the variations between these countries' systems, we just got a lot of repetition about how nice free health care is.</p>
<p>But the movie was still effective, and very entertaining — Michael Moore's a funny guy, and he knows how to pluck a heartstring. I think most people will leave the theater angry about our healthcare system and envious of the French, and that's probably about as much as one can reasonably expect. I'll be curious to hear what <a class="reference external" href="http://dcist.com/staff.php#dcist_ian">Ian</a> (who was also in attendance) and <a class="reference external" href="http://ezraklein.typepad.com">Ezra</a> think.</p>

                    <p>Tim Lee <a class="reference external" href="http://www.techliberation.com/archives/042486.php">takes issue</a> with <a class="reference external" href="http://www.strategy-business.com/press/freearticle/07204?pg=all">an article by Nicholas Carr</a> in which Carr explores the limits of the open source development methodology. Carr says the OSS isn't very good at innovating. Tim disagrees:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">There are lots of examples of ground-breaking free software. Apache wasnâ€™t the first web server, but it preceded most of the proprietary servers now on the market, and itâ€™s been the market leader almost from its introduction. Perl, Python, PHP, BitTorrent, and SendMail are a few examples off the top of my head of free software programs that arenâ€™t clones of proprietary protocols. And on the flip side, a lot of Microsoft software is derivative. For example, Excel, Word, Windows, IIS, and SQL Server were all late-comers to markets that had been pioneered by other companies.</div>
<div class="line">The reality is that really groundbreaking software ideas — word processors, spreadsheets, the web — are extremely rare, and theyâ€™re usually the work of a single smart individual. Whether that individual chooses to commercialize his idea or license it as free software is up to the whim of that individual. The vast majority of software development, on the other hand, involves making incremental improvements to existing software products and concepts. As far as I can see, thatâ€™s equally true whether youâ€™re talking about free software or proprietary software.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>I think Tim's right: it's silly to complain about the lack of paradigm-shifting projects on <a class="reference external" href="http://www.sourceforge.net">SourceForge</a>. Ideas like the nonlinear video editor, the word processor or the spreadsheet simply don't come along all that often, and many of them originated before the internet had made open source software possible and widely-known. And, in fact, I think you'd be surprised how many <a class="reference external" href="http://www.dontclick.it">experimental interfaces</a> you could find in the open source world if you cared to look. It's just that most of them are pretty lousy. Boring as it may be, I believe that there is a relatively narrow range of visual metaphors that are appropriate for manipulating data on a 2D display with a pointing device and a bunch of buttons.</p>
<p>With that said, I do think Tim's overstating his case just a bit. There aren't enough originality-related datapoints within the world of classical applications — instead, let's look at games. The evidence here is less than encouraging. There are plenty of open-source games, but few have gained traction in a serious way. And they're frequently derivative: the most successful open-source games tend to be clones of existing commercial games like <a class="reference external" href="http://osswin.sourceforge.net/games.html#tetris_clones">Tetris</a> or <a class="reference external" href="http://freeciv.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page">Civilization</a>, or applications that <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-Strike">build on</a> or <a class="reference external" href="http://www.mame.net/">otherwise</a> <a class="reference external" href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~owend/free/bnetd.html">support</a> playing commercial games more cheaply or easily.</p>
<p>But I don't think this lack of originality is due to any inherent flaw in open-source contributors or the organizational model they employ. I think it's simply a question of capital — open source projects typically haven't got any. The vast majority of applications benefit from network effects that arise when their userbase becomes large enough: suddenly it's easier to find someone to play against online, or the documentation is better, or you can exchange files in the same format that your friend uses. It's relatively easy for open-source projects to achieve the necessary level of market interest when dealing with highly technical users and applications, as Tim's examples demonstrate — there are accepted techniques (e.g. the RFC process, making frequent commits to the project) and media outlets (e.g. listservs, usenet) that can confer legitimacy and generate interest without an investment.</p>
<p>That isn't true for products aimed at consumers, however — these frequently require investment in concerted promotion efforts in order to reach the network tipping point (or else must meet an unfulfilled need in a way that generates earned media like Wikipedia has). Witness the Ogg Vorbis audio format, which is widely agreed to be technically superior to MP3, offers advantages that are applicable to the average consumer, and has been <a class="reference external" href="http://www.neurosaudio.com/">almost</a> completely ignored.</p>
<p>This brings up another issue: collaboration with the private sector is often much more difficult for open source projects. If Ogg had been able to attract support among portable audio player manufacturers its history might be very different. Similarly, it's easy to imagine that if the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.blender.org/">Blender</a> project could talk to Nvidia about what advances their next generation graphics cards will offer, it might be able to better-compete with professional products like Maya and 3DS Max (I should note that I'm not particularly familiar with 3D modeling software, so perhaps I'm wrong about this).</p>
<p>But that's frequently not possible, and consequently the open-source projects that succeed are the ones that can form a symbiotic or parasitic relationship with products that have institutional backing. It's a lot easier to get folks to use your word processor if it can speak to Microsoft Word; it's a lot easier to get people to play your FPS if it's an add-on to a game that already has a large installed base; it's a lot easier to launch an IM client if it talks to an existing network.</p>
<p>That's the issue, I think. Carr makes out open source software's derivative nature to be a question of organization, but that's flatly wrong. The conventions may be different, but many projects have well-developed protocols surrounding the use of development IRC channels or mailing lists. Anyone who thinks the Mozilla or Apache (or Drupal!) projects could have achieved what they have without a high degree of coordination among volunteers is crazy. These organizations have roadmaps, design documents and established internal policies. It's just PR money and private-sector legitimacy that they lack. Fortunately the public's increasing technical literacy means that the need for the former is declining; the undeniable commercial relevance of open source means that projects are increasingly being accorded the latter.</p>

                    <p><em>John From Cincinnati</em>: still terrible, but now somewhat easier to spell. It's remarkable how little interaction the characters engage in. The show is mostly composed of aimless soliloquies. Admittedly, there will sometimes be some yelling about how one person is a disappointing son/mother/father/husband/wife, and the other is a disappointing opposite-of-that. But these fights quickly devolve into the characters speaking past one another, and then it's back to spouting disconnected profundities as if I was paying $10 a month to watch ponderous student films with strangely high production values.</p>
<p>Still, tonight was an improvement over week one, primarily because last week I missed the intro and so was pleasantly surprised to hear my favorite post-Clash Joe Strummer song being used for the opening music. Good job, HBO. Way to play songs I like when I'm not riding my bike back from U Street. Keep making those kinds of creative tweaks and you just might have another hit on your hands.</p>
<p>Despite this forward progress, <em>John From Cincinnati</em> remains a bad TV show. But I'm quickly developing a sense of apathetic tolerance toward it, like scar tissue forming around a foreign object (in my Sunday TV schedule). The human body, and in particular its desire not to get up from the couch, is an amazing thing.</p>
<p><em>Flight of the Conchords</em>: highly promising! Back in college I loved Tenacious D, but have been increasingly embarrassed about it ever since their album came out — it turned out that what I thought was a pretty funny joke wasn't actually the joke being told by the people doing the telling. These days I'm older, more sedate and, let's face it, quite a bit wussier. I'm glad to see that parodic folk-pop has finally caught up with my slowed-down outlook. Flight of the Conchords : Tenacious D :: VH1 : MTV. Except that makes it sound like I don't like the show and/or that I enjoy like VH1. I assure you that neither is the case.</p>
