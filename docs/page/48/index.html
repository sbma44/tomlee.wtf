                    <p>This morning Slashdot <a class="reference external" href="http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/05/09/2248254&amp;from=rss">linked</a> to a <a class="reference external" href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20070509-escaping-the-data-panopticon-teaching-computers-to-forget.html">piece over at Ars Technica</a> quoting Viktor Mayer-SchÃ¶nberger of Harvard's Kennedy School (whew!) on the subject of digital forgetfulness. The problem, he says, is that anyone participating in online society will accumulate an ever-larger tail of embarrassing cruft. It'll be trivially easy for us to confront one another with <a class="reference external" href="http://wonkette.com/politics/bill-frist/john-frist-beer-wrangler-178678.php">beer-belt pictures</a> and Inuyasha fanfic written at age fourteen. &quot;Gotcha!&quot; will move out of the realm of politics and into the office.</p>
<p>I can already see my friends' concern over this manifesting itself. I think that their (partial) blogospheric exodus toward Facebook is motivated, to some extent, by these sorts of worries. Clients and coworkers read their sites, and they don't like the constraints that imposes. No offense to the clients and coworkers reading this, but I don't always like it either — it's disappointing to feel like there are limits on your personal writing. I'm unwilling to flee to Facebook, but that's just my own hangup — if your online creative output includes technology, it feels like a straightjacket (and, of course, its founder is a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=502722">thief</a>, which makes my web-developer self loathe to endorse it in any way). But I can understand why others would want to.</p>
<p>Still, fleeing to proprietary communities is just a stopgap measure. My completely-neglected Facebook profile currently has at least one friend request from a client waiting. Of course I could decline to approve it, or grant limited access to my profile (so I'm told, anyway). But what are the social implications of doing that? Is it considered a snub? If it isn't, how long until it will be? No, it seems inevitable that your activity in any given online community will eventually become part of your publicly-known personal history, limiting the sorts of ways that you can comfortably express yourself.</p>
<p>Admittedly, all of this is sort of peripheral to Mayer-SchÃ¶nberger's point. Social circles will no doubt continue to flee across the internet as the grown-ups (so to speak) encroach on them. Staying one step ahead of your professional contacts <em>is</em>, by and large, a viable strategy for not poisoning your work relationships by exposing your horrible true self.</p>
<p>Mayer-SchÃ¶nberger doesn't seem concerned with these ongoing public/private struggles. Rather, he's worried about the potential for finding embarrassing information about a person's history at a single given point in the future. It's bound to happen: there's real utility to be had by, say, exposing Facebook information to a search engine. If Google refuses to do it, someone else will. And of course there are plenty of other sources of potentially embarrassing information out there (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/YOUR-NAME-HERE/tags/drunk">http://www.flickr.com/photos/YOUR-NAME-HERE/tags/drunk</a>). If anyone dug up digitized copies of the short stories I wrote for my high school literary journal, I'd fully expect to be penniless and living on the streets by nightfall (it would be well-deserved, I assure you).</p>
<p>M-S (if I can call him that) suggests a legally mandated technological system that would, by default, cause data to be deleted after a period of time. I'm sure his heart is in the right place, but this is dumb for all the same reasons that DRM is dumb. You really, really can't control the spread or persistence of publicly available digital information. Efforts to do so are a waste of everyone's time.</p>
<p>But it's a real problem nonetheless. I see two likely solutions: first, increased adoption of <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darknet">Darknets</a>, invite-only communities and largely-anonymous forums like Unfogged (although the protective namelessness of that community is pretty much gone). But that's not a complete solution, for the reasons listed above.</p>
<p>The real answer is just for us, as a society, to get over ourselves: to stop pretending that no one ever gets drunk in college, ever says things they don't mean, or has a sex drive. It's wildly optimistic, I know. But we've gotten over needing our politicians to be undivorced teetotalers who never say anything dumb (and how!). Maybe the generations that have been online their entire adult lives will have a diminished capacity for puritanical self-deception. I hope so, anyway.</p>

                    <p>There are some little kids playing music in front of the school at 16th and L and you know what? They aren't that bad — definitely better than some Ft. Reno acts I've seen. And with their aggressive &amp; lousy drumming; dreamy feedback; dreary, meandering keyboards; and singing that sort of recalls Tom Morello (until you see the vocalist is, like, 8), I think they'd fit right in.</p>

<li>familiarity with both Palladium and TSR roleplaying game systems, including the ability to ruminate at length on the relative utility of twelve-sided die versus a d100</li>
<li>computers: I like 'em!</li>
<li>near-total incompetence at all team sports</li>
<li>and of course, the backgrounds in videogames and comics that are de rigeur for a male of my generation</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a few glaring omissions: I've never played a collectible card game like Magic: The Gathering; I've never been to a sci-fi convention or Renaissance Faire (although I think I deserve partial credit for attending multiple computer shows); and I have, in fact, seen a girl naked (not sure what to do about that one).</p>
<p>Still, I'm pleased to announce additional progress. Yesterday I received a package containing the first truly dorky board game that I've owned. And when I say truly dorky, I mean it — this isn't some Risk bullshit. Captains of football teams play Risk! No, this is a different sort of thing all together.</p>
<p>Jeff introduced me to the genre when he came home for Christmas, bringing the game <a class="reference external" href="http://www.riograndegames.com/">Puerto Rico</a> with him. I found it immediately appealing: its tendency to facilitate offensive jokes about colonialism and capacity for screwing over your fellow man made it a lot of fun. Then when I visited Jeff in California this spring we played <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Grid_(board_game)">Power Grid</a>, which I liked even more (and which, with its economically-oriented gameplay elements, seemed like it would be enjoyable to a lot of people I know).</p>
<p>But Jeff convinced me that I'd be better served by starting off with a simpler game. So I bought <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcassonne_%28board_game%29">Carcassonne</a>, which is considered a prototypical example of this so-called <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German-style_board_game">German-style board game</a> (presumably because the game revolves around divvying up real estate in France).</p>
<p>Some of you have probably heard of or even played it before — the only game from this genre that's better-known is <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settlers_of_Catan">Settlers of Catan</a>, which is popular enough to have <a class="reference external" href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/2007/05/04">shown up on Xbox Live</a>. But Carcassonne was new to me when <a class="reference external" href="http://dccharles.blogspot.com">Charles</a> and I gave it a try last night. The verdict: pretty fun!</p>
<p>But I can already feel the hunger growing — this one won't keep me satisfied for long. I need more tiles! More complex rules! More numerous and varied bits of varnished wood to lose under the couch! Things could get ugly before it's all over.</p>

Don't get me wrong: it was very good — amazingly so, given the terrible venue. But it wasn't up to the standard they had set during their shows at the Black Cat and 9:30 club. There wasn't much improvisation; the three-song encore was short; Regine <em>really</em> can't sing while drumming; and they generally seemed less-committed to the performance than they have in the past.</p>
<p>I got my money's worth, but this is a band whose live act I typically rank behind only Springsteen and the Flaming Lips. The performance at DAR wasn't nearly that good. The Saturday show in Philadelphia was considerably better despite having a nearly-identical setlist (this was partially a function of the venue being less than godawful, though).</p>
<p>It makes me happy to see that a lot of people enjoyed the show, and I certainly don't want to take away from that. But trust me: this band is capable of even more.</p>
<p><strong>ALSO:</strong> It might be worth noting that Joel, who knows a band member, reported that Winn went home immediately after the Philly show. They cancelled the final part of their European tour due to illness, and I wouldn't be surprised if they were just getting a little tired of being on the road.</p>

                    <p>Ed Felten has <a class="reference external" href="http://www.freedom-to-tinker.com/?p=1154">an interesting post</a> up this morning discussing the 09-f9 HD-DVD key and why the net has been replicating it so enthusiastically. He has a number of explanations for why people are showing such antipathy toward the AACS LA's efforts to suppress the key. I'm most interested in the second one, because it's pretty widespread and very, very silly:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">...the content in question is an integer — an ordinary number, in other words. The number is often written in geeky alphanumeric format, but it can be written equivalently in a more user-friendly form like 790,815,794,162,126,871,771,506,399,625. Giving a private party ownership of a number seems deeply wrong to people versed in mathematics and computer science. Letting a private group pick out many millions of numbers (like the AACS secret keys), and then simply declare ownership of them, seems even worse</div>
<div class="line">While itâ€™s obvious why the creator of a movie or a song might deserve some special claim over the use of their creation, itâ€™s hard to see why anyone should be able to pick a number at random and unilaterally declare ownership of it. There is nothing creative about this number — indeed, it was chosen by a method designed to ensure that the resulting number was in no way special. Itâ€™s just a number they picked out of a hat. And now they own it?</div>
<div class="line">As if thatâ€™s not weird enough, there are actually millions of other numbers (other keys used in AACS) that AACS LA claims to own, and we donâ€™t know what they are. When I wrote the thirty-digit number that appears above, I carefully avoided writing the real 09F9 number, so as to avoid the possibility of mind-bending lawsuits over integer ownership. But there is still a nonzero probability that AACS LA thinks it owns the number I wrote.</div>
<div class="line">When the great mathematician Leopold Kronecker wrote his famous dictum, â€œGod created the integers; all else is the work of manâ€?, he meant that the basic structure of mathematics is part of the design of the universe. What God created, AACS LA now wants to take away.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Okay, so it's a little melodramatic. But you can see his point. He's not alone in this, either: BoingBoing has been <a class="reference external" href="http://www.boingboing.net/2007/05/02/oh_how_i_love_the_ge.html">petulantly</a> <a class="reference external" href="http://www.boingboing.net/2007/05/02/are_these_colors_ill.html">maintaining</a> that if we all just pretend the number is being used for other purposes, it'll be just dandy to redistribute it.</p>
<p>I'm no fan of DRM, and I think the AACS LA's actions are pointless and stupid. But Doctorow and Felten are being disingenuous — they're simply too smart not to see the problem with this argument. Namely, that <em>any</em> type of data, sampled at a chosen level of precision, can be represented as a number. Consequently, if you believe that one or more types of information deserve legal protection — as Felten seems to, when he refers to songs &amp; movies — then the argument that &quot;it's just a number!&quot; becomes ridiculous.</p>
<p>Sixteen bytes is probably too short to merit a copyright. But that's not the right that the AACS LA is asserting: they're calling the code a &quot;circumvention device&quot; under the DMCA. And even if you don't recognize the DMCA's validity, there are other forms of intellectual property protection that may apply — there are laws related to trade secrets, for example. If you just think about it a little, it should be obvious that even a very short piece of data can enjoy some kinds of legal protection. Sixteen bytes is more that enough room to encode the words &quot;Coca-Cola&quot;, after all.</p>
<p>The thing is, geeks like to pretend that the legal system is some sort of Rube Goldberg contraption, easily foiled by their unparalleled cleverness. Sadly, this isn't the case. All the IANAL-prefixed prattling on Slashdot about quick &amp; easy ways to make yourself legally bulletproof when the cops/MPAA/interpol come knocking are little more than wishful thinking. It's like holding your finger an inch from your sibling's face and yelling, &quot;I'm not touching you!&quot; over and over. Your parents weren't dumb enough to fall for that, and neither is the legal system.</p>
<p>So yes, if you accidentally used <a class="reference external" href="http://t3knomanser.livejournal.com/906184.html">these colors</a> in a design, I doubt you'd be breaking the law. If you wrote this <a class="reference external" href="http://scriptorium.monastic.org/">terrible poem</a> by chance, you'd be fine. But if you provided either intentionally, as a way of transmitting a &quot;circumvention device&quot;, then you broke the law. It's entirely possible for a judge to make reasonable inferences about what you probably intended to do. I don't know where people got the idea that courtrooms are run by robots that'll start spewing sparks &amp; smoke if you feed them a logical paradox. It just ain't so.</p>
<p>Most of all, I'm surprised by Felten saying that making a number protected will irk &quot;people versed in mathematics and computer science&quot; most of all. In fact, the people who don't understand why a number could deserve protection are the ones who sat through their CS and information theory classes but emerged without actually understanding the point of it all. Information is information. The fact that it can be encoded in many different ways is neat — it's nearly magical, in fact, and the very essence of why digital technology is so amazingly powerful — but doesn't change its essential nature. Refusing to admit that numbers are only protected <em>in context</em> reveals either ignorance of these ideas or simple denial of them.</p>

                    <p>Emily's signed up for the Club For Growth's email list and seems to really enjoy it. I didn't really understand why, and instead simply chalked it up to the Norquistian charisma that some of my other friends have fallen for.</p>
<p>But now I've got my own Club For Growth equivalent, and I think I understand the perverse pleasure she gets from reading awful emails. Particularly when they're obsessed with perversity.</p>
<p>To wit, let me highly recommend the American Family Association's Action Alerts list. It's been delivering hilariously homophobic gems to my inbox ever since <a class="reference external" href="http://blogstretch.blogspot.com/2007/04/little-ambush.html">Amanda's post</a> got me to sign their survey in support of the gay agenda. I don't think I'm ready to give them my real email address, but last night's <a class="reference external" href="http://www.afa.net/sexualorientations.asp">amusingly terrified list of sexual orientations</a> convinced me to re-up their <a class="reference external" href="http://www.spamgourmet.com">SpamGourmet</a> bucket. Heed the words of founder and chairman Donald E. Wildmon says, &quot;Warning! This listing is offensive.&quot;</p>
<p>Still, to their credit and my immense surprise, Google seems to think that the term <em>telephone scatalogia</em> isn't an AFA creation. Might be time to add Latin to the required coursework for a degree in Gender &amp; Sexuality Studies, academy — if you ask me, T.S. is considerably stupider-sounding than the faux-Latin in the Harry Potter books. Trust me, it's much easier to cow people into intellectual submission if they can't understand what the hell you're talking about. Why do you think we geeks come up with so many acronyms?</p>

                    <p>It's been a few weeks since tax day, and that means my time is short. In a very little while my knowledge of and attention to my finances will transform back into a pumpkin, returning to its default state: quarterly comparisons of my checking balance and bar tabs to determine whether I should be drinking less, more, or much more (there are some discontinuities in the function).</p>
<p>I really, really hate dealing with money. It stresses me out, leaving me irritable and petty. Online bill payments have made my life significantly better, so much so that I've completely surrendered myself to them. For a while I insisted on manually responding to electronic bills. Then I automated known outgoing payments like rent. Then I set things up to automatically pay incoming bills. These days I'm perfectly happy to hand my SSN and a cheek swab over to even the shadiest vendor's auto-payment system. So what if they route payments through a Nigerian goldenpalace.com subsidiary with an expired SSL certificate? I don't care. I just want to be left alone until someone tells me I'm supposed to appear in court.</p>
<p>But like I said, I'm still in the midst of one of my financial waking periods, and I should probably seize the moment. I know it's uncouth to complain about not knowing what to do alllll one's vast estates and holdings. But, like a musician who can't help recording a sophomore album about how there's a downside to fame (man), I can't resist. The fact is that once, a long time ago, I was capable of saving money. For a while, I did so. The result was not a princely sum by any means, but enough that I should probably figure out something to do with it: partly because I may someday have expenses beyond electronics, beer and rent; but mostly because I'm tired of Bank of America employees stifling laughs and avoiding eye contact whenever I walk by one of their branches.</p>
<p>The obvious answer is to invest it somewhere. But where? And how? It's tempting to fritter it all away on hand-picked stocks, but a long-gone intern's incessant prattling about his portfolio convinced me that E*Trade's potential for turning me into an insufferable ass makes it an undesirable investment vehicle.</p>
<p>Besides, I remember the lesson taught to me by my ECON101 instructor (author of economic mystery novel <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Fatal-Equilibrium-Marshall-Jevons/dp/0345331583/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/103-3660562-2811854?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1178033693&amp;sr=8-1">The Fatal Equilibrium</a> — yes, really): no matter what you think you know, the market already knows it and has priced itself to reflect it. Got a hunch? The market's on to you. Heard a hot tip? The market did, too. Did you just invent a cheap &amp; effective robot bride at a secret facility buried deep within the earth's crust? Sorry weirdo, the market was hiding in the ductwork and has already radioed the news back to the trading floor. Even if you caught it, it'd just crush the cyanide-filled false molar implanted in its jaw before you could get any information from it.</p>
<p>So the thing to do, apparently, is to find an index fund, which lets you spread your investment across the top 500 or 1000 stocks in various segments of the market. This strategy gets around the problem of your not being very good at picking stocks AND the problem of professional stock-pickers not being very good at picking stocks.</p>

Figuring out which business to hire has proven unusually difficult, however. My tried &amp; true method for this sort of thing is to find the firm with the best cartoon mascot. For example, if I was still in the market for car insurance I'd obviously have to give my business to the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.esurance.com">creators</a> of sexy cartoon minx <a class="reference external" href="http://www.slate.com/id/2154026/?nav=navoa">Erin</a>, who periodically fights robotic menaces with an unnamed animated lummox (can't you see he's all wrong for you, Erin!?).</p>
<p>But things aren't as clear-cut in the financial arena. The closest thing to a cartoon that I can think of are these Charles Schwab commercials that rip off <em>Waking Life</em>:</p>
<p><img alt="still from a charles schwab commercial that apes the visual style of waking life/scanner darkly" class="center" src="/static/2007/05/01/20070501_charlesschwab.jpg" style="width: 445px; height: 332px;" /></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=ete3p0AQf98&amp;mode=related&amp;search=">Counteraguments aside</a>, I decided to give it a shot. But it's hopelessly confusing. There are <em>tons</em> of funds. And although they're rated with a varying number of stars along just a few axes (in order to assist stupid people like myself), the overall risk/reward relationship doesn't appear to be zero-sum. This leaves me wondering why anyone wouldn't just pick the one with the best combination of stars — and why it's so hard to use the interface to find that one (maybe this is why investment bankers are so well-paid). Until I figure out the answers to these questions I'm too terrified to do anything.</p>

<div class="line-block">

<div class="line">&quot;dcist&quot; on Flickr. I was getting ready to do this with <a class="reference external" href="http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/schani/metapixel/">metapixel</a> and a custom script, but today (via <a class="reference external" href="http://www.tuaw.com">TUAW</a>) I stumbled over the horribly-named <a class="reference external" href="http://homepage.mac.com/knarf/MacOSaiX/">MacOSaiX</a>, which did exactly what I wanted. Neat.</div>
</div>
<p>All of this is occasioned by my Q+!U DC flag t-shirt getting worn-out enough to cross over into the &quot;gymwear&quot; category. Well, that and this video:</p>
<p><center><object width="425" height="350"><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/DJ5OBhlJEhQ" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="350"></embed></object></center></p><p>A new flag-themed t-shirt is in order, and doing something with Spreadshirt seems like a good idea. So I whipped up a couple of illustrator files — if you want them, here you go. I've certainly found myself wanting a high-quality vector version of the flag before. But then, I may have to come up with more graphics for DCist than the average internet user...</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="/static/2007/04/30/dc_flag.ai">DC Flag (accurate)</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="/static/2007/04/30/dc_flag_narrow.ai">DC Flag (squashed into a snazzier configuration)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I was thinking of redoing the flag in ASCII but, like my <a class="reference external" href="/2007/01/17/asciimation/">last project</a> along these lines, the early returns are a little underwhelming:</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/478976909/"><img alt="DC Flag in ASCII" class="center" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/184/478976909_f79adae5fd.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: 338px;" /></a></p>
<p>On the other hand, this music video makes me think that the idea is sound — it's just my execution that's off. Check it out, the ASCII starts about halfway through and is pretty neat.</p>

                    <p>Vegetate: surprisingly popular. I headed over this evening to wish <a class="reference external" href="http://www.goodspeedupdate.com">Rob</a> a happy 25th birthday and was amazed to see to see how packed the all-veggie restaurant became before I left. I'd just sort of assumed that this was another well-meaning progressive initiative that my superficial support would be unable to save from inevitable failure. You know, like Air America. Or affirmative action.</p>
<p>But no! The place was chock full of earnest vegetarians, vegans and perhaps even a few <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breatharianism">Breatharians</a>. The bar only stocked a dozen or so bottles of liquor, but they were all plenty fancy. And the sadly lacking beer selection didn't stop me from becoming adequately intoxicated.</p>
<p>Anyway, I was caught off guard. During their lengthy battle with Shiloh I had assumed that the business was somehow paying its rent with dividends earned on a well-justified sense of indignation. But I guess there are actually lot of people out there who don't like eating meat. Well, good for them. But do me a favor and demand a few more types of beer to go with your not-meat.</p>
