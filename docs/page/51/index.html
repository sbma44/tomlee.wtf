                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>Let's make up for yesterday's <a class="reference external" href="/2007/03/28/this-is-pretty-neat/#comment-1424">egregious overtagging</a>. <a class="reference external" href="http://science.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/03/29/0317248&amp;from=rss">Via Slashdot</a> I see that some researchers at the MIT Media Lab have <a class="reference external" href="http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2007/brain-block.html">figured out a novel way to stop neurons from firing</a>. The secret lies with a light-sensitive chloride channel — shine yellow light on the neurons and chloride ions flood into the cell, eliminating the potential across its membrane and making it impossible for it to fire. They know the gene for this chloride gate, too — it comes from a particular bacterium.</p>
<p>The subhead? &quot;Work could lead to non-surgical treatment for epilepsy, Parkinson's&quot;. Christ. This conclusion is apparently based on the following quote from someone at the Media Lab:</p>
<blockquote>
&quot;In the future, controlling the activity patterns of neurons may enable very specific treatments for neurological and psychiatric diseases, with few or no side effects&quot;</blockquote>
<p>Well, yes. A correlary: in the future, eliminating physical infirmity could allow more people to lead full, active lives, with few or no side effects.</p>
<blockquote>
The new MIT research could lead to the development of optical brain prosthetics to control neurons, eliminating the need for irreversible surgery.</blockquote>
<p>Despite cool CGI sequences like the intro to <em>Fight Club</em>, our brains aren't actually filled with flashing pulses of light. If you intend to stick yellow lightbulbs in there, you're going to need some kind of surgery.</p>
<p>But all of this is beside the point, because <em>humans don't have the chloride channel in question</em>. The Media Lab people are talking about making transgenic mice that would, and that's cool. But if adding new genes to human brains were easy (or safe), there'd be more direct ways to treat the sorts of neurological diseases that the article hints at, since many of them are associated with specific genetic defects.</p>
<p>None of this stupidity is the Media Lab's fault, incidentally. Their neuroscience program is very new, and while this work seems cool and may provide a genuinely useful research tool, it's probably not actually as cutting-edge as the article would like us to believe. But when you're writing grant applications you have to come up with justifications for the innovatively terrible things you plan to do to mice. &quot;Curing all sorts of diseases (someday)&quot; is a popular choice. It's just like when I was on the debate team in high school: the downside to the team's other plan is <em>always</em> that it will cause the planet to erupt in global thermonuclear war. Should we extend Most Favored Nation status to China? Well, the downside is an inevitable nuclear holocaust. On the other hand, if we fail to grant MFN we'll still all be reduced to atomic ash. Here, I have some out-of-context quotes from a Newsweek editorial to prove it.</p>
<p>And so it is with science journalism: every reported advance will cure disease, provide infinite clean energy, or revolutionize the way we work, eat and play. It's pretty frustrating — there's a surplus of science PhDs out there, right? Would it really be so hard to find one who also knows AP style? Is it really so impossible to write a story with a hook other than &quot;technology is magic&quot;!?</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>Yesterday Kriston <a class="reference external" href="http://grammarpolice.net/archives/001250.php">linked</a> to <a class="reference external" href="http://volokh.com/archives/archive_2007_03_25-2007_03_31.shtml#1174960427">an interesting post</a> by Ilya Somin over at The Volokh Conspiracy that wondered what the next changes in our cultural morals will be. Nobody thinks that slavery is okay or that women are inferior to men; similarly, it now seems inevitable that homosexuality will eventually be accepted by society. But what will come after that?</p>
<p>Somin identifies animal rights, capital punishment and forced national service as the likeliest candidates. It's a pretty good list, although I think his libertarian instincts may make him overestimate the likelihood of forced national service becoming a real cause celebre. Similarly, my own instincts make me want to believe that the moral and policy case against capital punishment will gain traction soon — but I also suspect that the death penalty's usefulness for podium-thumping means that it's here to stay for a while longer.</p>
<p>The question of animal rights is the most interesting of the three, I think, and one that I can easily imagine becoming a significant cultural issue. Among my peers, at least, I think there's a general sense that animal suffering is bad and should be minimized, but also an understanding that it may be acceptable in some circumstances. Medical testing? Probably. Rhinocerous-horn aphrodisiacs? Probably not. What's the exchange rate between animal suffering and human enjoyment, anyway, and is it weighted by the complexity of the animal's nervous system? I'm not too worried about a bivalve's subjective experience of pain — pig is more problematic (maybe we should breed or engineer stupider ones). What of bacon?! A little bit goes a long way, after all.</p>
<p>Anyway, it does make one wonder whether there's an end point to society's moral evolution or whether this will be an endless process. It's clear that we haven't yet arrived at what you or I or most people would define as a completely just society. But it also seems likely that someday we'll slip into fuddy-duddy-dom and have our own sense of social justice eclipsed by earnest door-to-door canvassers campaigning for, I don't know, the right to urinate in public. We'll think that we and we alone were fit to judge the right stopping place for the march of progress. No doubt our great-grandparents thought the same thing.</p>
<p>Alternately, maybe we'll someday reach an endpoint. We'll all shuttle through pneumatic tubes in silver jumpsuits and androgenously shaved heads, confident that that there are good and immutable reasons for the few remaining limits on personal liberty that we impose on one another. I've got no idea which scenario will triumph. I'm pretty confident that I'll be dead by the time it all shakes out.</p>
<p>What'll actually be relevant (and at least somewhat related) are the new advances in rebelliousness implemented by the lousy teenagers that many of us will eventually spawn. There's obviously an element of unpredictability here — you wouldn't want to defy social norms in a way that can be anticipated by the squares, after all — but the range of innovatively outrageous teenage behaviors that are at all practical seem to be diminishing. I suppose that the biological realities of parenting make sexuality, tattoos and drug use sort of evergreen options for misunderstood teenagers. But those are also all pretty common in our popular culture. To <em>really</em> be at the forefront of rebellion the kids will have to come up with something new.</p>
<p>My money's on voluntary limb amputation. I predict a sudden uptic in the incidence of <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apotemnophilia">BIID</a>, a rash of shocked newscasts, and a lot of impassioned essays about the limits of the ADA. It's going to be really irritating and, to me and my fellow liberal paternalists, more than a little tragic. Our only hope is for cyborg modification to become feasible first. As you can probably guess, I'm a bit more bullish on that issue.</p>

                    <p>Let's not leave things on a down note. You know what I haven't posted yet? Photos of California. So here they are — the best ones, anyway. The full set of at-least-vaguely-redeemable photos can be found <a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/sets/72157600030591614/">here</a>.</p>
<p>I wish I'd taken more shots of my friends, any of my relatives, and fewer pitcures of natural splendor — pictures of the first two are usually pretty fun, and pictures of the latter are usually kind of a letdown next to the real thing. But there are a few decent pics in there that at least hint at how astoundingly beautiful <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nps.gov/pore/">Point Reyes</a> is.</p>
<p>But of course the highlight of the trip wasn't any of the touristy crap, but rather just getting the chance to see folks I hadn't in a while. It was really good to meet up with <a class="reference external" href="http://www.mp3.com/users/Jon47/profile.php">Jon</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.jeffnye.org">Jeff</a>, Marie and Paul, and to meet Paul's girlfriend. And seeing Noree, Ron, Jeb and Mimi was wonderful. I really can't thank Jeff &amp; Marie and Noree &amp; Ron enough for putting us up. Berkeley is a pretty great location for a California vacation home base, it turns out. Not only because it's walkable and close to the BART, but also because <a class="reference external" href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/8xJosknJdcPGPUQ4Pod99w">co-op pizza</a> is GREAT pizza. You can really taste the collectivism — delicious, delicious collectivism.</p>

                    <p>I got an EVDO card for a long weekend from Verizon, then returned it. &quot;You'll be prorated,&quot; I was assured. I wasn't, and instead got charged a full month's fees for 4 days' worth of use.</p>
<p>I thought I'd paid it anyway, but maybe not. Either way, I eventually got a message from &quot;Miracle Financial&quot;. I returned their call and left a message asking for them to call me back and let me know what they were calling about. I had also gotten a call from another financial company on the same night, but that one was looking for someone else. I figured that some predatory lending agency had gotten my number on an industry-wide spam list, so after doing my part for our new game of phone tag I didn't think much else about it.</p>
<p>The next call I got was today, and came from an abusive gentleman who refused to let me leave the conversation in order to call Verizon. Instead he started yelling about my credit report (as if a $70 outstanding balance was going to put that dreamhouse of mine out of reach). &quot;We'll be calling you for seven years!&quot; he bellowed, which didn't make an awful lot of sense — I think the number comes from the years until an offense goes off your credit report, but who knows. I assume he does this all the time, so it must work despite the complete lack of sense.</p>
<p>I'm disinclined to feed money directly to people who call me up to yell at me, so I hung up on him and called Verizon. A maze of prompts later I get a human being, who told me that I couldn't talk to them about the issue — I'd have to talk to the collection guys. Of course, the collection guy had already told me that I can't talk to them about the incorrect charge, either. I just need to pay up, preferably by directly giving my credit card number to some lout who had called me out of the blue.</p>
<p>So I cut them a check. What else could I do? If a company decides you owe them money, they can simply refuse to listen to you or correct their mistake. Instead they'll pay some professional dickhead in Massachusetts to harass you by telephone until you give up. If that fails they'll tell every other corporation how terrible you are. Unless you're a lawyer with a lot of free time, there's not much you can do about it.</p>
<p>I remember many still, sunny Sunday mornings at UVA when the perfect awfulness of my hangover was wrenched into consciousness by an angry collections call. Not for me, of course — I'm actually surprisingly good at paying my bills, despite only opening my mail once a month or so. Instead it was for the people who had the phone number before me. They would tell me not to deny that I was [name other than my own], and strongly encourage me to settle my outstanding debt immediately. And they'd do with the same prerecorded call every time. I eventually had to track down the company responsible, call during business hours and politely ask them to shut the fuck up. To their credit, they did. Still, you have to wonder about what would drive someone into a career of professional unpleasantness.</p>
<p>Anyway, it's a lousy thing to have happen in the middle of your day, and all the more infuriating because these jerks don't even have a web presence for me to sheepishly submit my payment to — instead I had to speak to an actual person. I still refused to do anything other than mail them a check, but that didn't make me feel much better. Will polluting their nonexistent Google ranking help? Nah, probably not. But dammit, I have to try.</p>

                    <p>Thoughts on the future of the recording industry from <a class="reference external" href="http://www.matthewyglesias.com/archives/2007/03/drm_fools/">Matt Yglesias</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/03/21/good-news-cd-music-sales-down-20-from-2006/">Michael Arrington</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://atrios.blogspot.com/2007_03_18_atrios_archive.html#117448466965070488">Atrios</a>. I particularly like Arrington's take — it's nice to see people abandoning the traditional shiny-happy rhetoric about how record labels just need to adapt to changing technology, then they'll all be be rich and happy again. The truth is that technology has drastically reduced the need for musical middlemen. I'm sure the industry will always exist in some form, but a lot of the people with financial stakes in it are doomed. Now we just have to get them to wrap up their unpleasantly-loud legal death rattle.</p>

I mean, yes, I have <a class="reference external" href="http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=706410178">a profile</a>. But as you may be able to tell from the listed interests, it's not much of a serious effort. I've been mildly horrified to see friend requests begin to roll in from people I know.</p>
<p>I just don't see the point. What's it supposed to do? Keep me <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rss">up to date</a> on my friends' activities? Let me <a class="reference external" href="http://flickr.com">post photos</a>? Or <a class="reference external" href="http://del.icio.us">share links</a>? Get <a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com">mobile updates</a>? <a class="reference external" href="http://www.evite.com">Plan</a> <a class="reference external" href="http://www.upcoming.org">events</a>? Bah! I've already got technologies that I use for all this stuff. There's no reason to reroute all that activity through the blue &amp; white blandness of a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22a%20Mark%20Zuckerberg%20production%22">cocky</a> <a class="reference external" href="http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=502722">thief</a>.</p>
<p>Alright, that's a little disingenuous. I can think of one reason: now that folks use the internet professionally, they probably now want to retreat into a lower-stakes setting. I guess I can understand that. But it still seems like a pain in the ass, and the idea of &quot;poking&quot; and giving $1 virtual gifts sends me into a blind rage.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I guess I should finish the point I intended to make. One of the things that Matt &quot;Wordpress&quot; Mullenweg said during his presentation at SXSW was that he foresaw the future of personalized online presences being grounded in individual online sites, not gigantic networks like Facebook and Myspace. Obviously he's got a vested interest in pushing this vision, but I agree with him: the big networks won't last forever. Right now they can offer ease-of-use and a critical mass of users that makes finding your friends easy. But they don't have a monopoly on the former (Wordpress and blogger are great counterexamples) and userbase size isn't an advantage that lasts forever — ask Friendster. The fad value of these sites will force the market to perpetually refactor itself, fragmenting a little more each time.</p>
<p>The logical end point is for everyone to be running their own relatively-open site, free from the shadow of corporate hosts. Open formats will let your site talk to everybody else's, keeping you apprised of what your friends are up to. It'll be great.</p>
<p>In fact, it already IS great, since our little bloggy universe already uses these technologies across our constellation of personal sites. That's why I think Facebook adoption is silly: it's a step backward.</p>
<p>With all of that said, I don't want to let pig-headedness cut me out of connectivity — I'm sure I'll put in a mild Facebook effort. But does it really not have RSS feeds?</p>

                    <p>I've got a bit of a reputation around the office for being completely useless and insufferable before I've had my first two or three cups of coffee. Although I'm not that bothered by this, I'm also not particularly pleased about it — I think that participation in the geek cult of caffeine is a fairly lame affectation, and I'd like to think that I can function without a chemical crutch. I haven't intentionally cultivated this reputation; I guess I've just accidentally been kind of mean to people.</p>
<p>But it's definitely true that I'm a better Tom when I have a few cups of coffee in me. I'm happier, smarter, and a <em>much</em> better writer — especially when I'm perched in that perfect spot between very- and too-caffeinated.</p>
<p>I don't think I'm much of a coffee snob, or at least I hope I'm not. I drink enough of the stuff (and take it unadorned) that I don't <em>taste</em> very much as I down it unless it's a particularly strong brew or has been burnt into sourness. And even if it has, I'll drink pretty much anything. I may talk excitedly about burr grinders and occasionally bring in bottles of vinegar to clean the office Mr. Coffee, but I'll happily suck down <a class="reference external" href="http://www.stereogum.com/archives/004889.html">Flavia</a>, too (so long as it isn't the flavored kind).</p>
<p>But the last couple of days have gotten me wondering about my brand. My all-time favorite is Trader Joe's house beans, which make me ecstatically wired and have most often done so when I'm working from home (this definitely helps build up positive associations). But at the office I'll drink whatever shows up in the kitchen. We've recently switched to this <a class="reference external" href="http://www.storyville.com/">Storyville</a> stuff, and the last few days I've found myself walking around in a foul-tempered funk. Each time a cup from Caribou cleared things right up, though, bringing me back to a relatively ebullient version of myself.</p>
<p>I know this is probably all psychosomatic. Still, it's a little weird. I've had <a class="reference external" href="http://www.zunta.org/blog/archives/2005/03/20/dont_eat_the_br/">extreme reactions</a> to particular coffee before (although in that case I sort of suspect that the stuff was tainted with a distinctly non-coffee ingredient). Other folks have theorized that Starbucks' popularity is due to its <a class="reference external" href="http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/20152/caffeine_nation_eyeopening_statistics.html">much higher caffeine levels</a> relative to other brands. And it's not as if caffeine is the only psychoactive chemical in coffee — there's theophylline, theobromine, and who knows how many others (<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maillard_reaction">partially burning food</a> creates lots of chemical variation ). Like <a class="reference external" href="http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/bb/neuro/neuro01/web2/Slaughter.html">chocolate</a>, there are probably a whole host of subtle physiological and psychological effects induced by coffee that aren't easy to consciously notice, but which contribute to how we use and perceive it. Is it unreasonable to think that different brands, blends and roasts may represent different ratios of these chemicals, and that they may induce varying affects? We've all heard people claim that tequila makes them crazy, or that gin gives them headaches, or that Jaegermeister makes them fight people. Right? Is it so crazy to think that this could happen, albeit on a smaller scale, with coffee?</p>
<p>The answer is almost certainly Yes, Tom, it's crazy to think that. The fact that you've been staying up late reading terrible <a class="reference external" href="http://www.marvel.com/comics/Civil_War">Civil War</a> comic books probably has a lot more to do with your foul moods over the last two days than anything you've had to drink. The difference is that fussing over coffee is more fun than not-reading-comics.</p>
<p>But now that I've convinced myself of this chemical curiousity — no matter how slightly — all hope of a rational explanation is gone. Until I settle on a similarly-magical countermeasure, I'll probably keep thinking that Storyville beans make me a jerk.</p>

                    <p>As I've mentioned before, I really like the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.techliberation.com">Technology Liberation Front</a>. My own ability to maintain righteous indignation over the DMCA waxes and wanes, and it's good to know that someone's holding down the fort.</p>
<p>But I do occasionally find their posts frustrating, and none more so than when they talk about the cell phone market. Too often their objections to regulation in this industry seem to boil down to, &quot;If there was enough consumer demand to justify a market for having a free market, the market would have selected for it! Market!&quot; I appreciate their enthusiasm for capitalism, and it's a good reminder for a legislation-happy liberal like myself. But you'd have to be completely insane to think that the American cell phone market is open in a way that offers meaningful choice to consumers.</p>
<p>And, courtesy of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.silbatron.com">Michael</a>, here comes a reminder of that fact. This one concerns a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.freeconference.com/">free conference call service</a> that we use at work:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Dear FreeConference User:</div>
<div class="line">AT&amp;T/Cingular, Sprint, and Qwest Are Blocking Your Conference Calling</div>
<div class="line">As of Friday, March 9, it's come to our attention that Cingular Wireless has begun blocking all conference calls made from Cingular handsets to selected conference numbers. If you call our service, you receive a recording that says, &quot;This call is not allowed from this number. Please dial 611 for customer service&quot;.</div>
<div class="line">Earlier this week, Sprint and Qwest joined in this action, blocking cellular and land line calls to these same numbers. This appears to be a coordinated effort to force you to use the paid services they provide, eliminating competition and blocking your right to use the conferencing services that work best for you.</div>
<div class="line">Don't Let AT&amp;T/Cingular, Sprint, or Qwest Take Away Your Right to Use the Conference Service of Your Choice!</div>
<div class="line">We Need Your Help! Please Take the Actions Below:</div>
<div class="line">etc. etc.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, maybe it's not foul play. Lately there's been a rash of non-toll-free numbers attracting huge amounts of inbound traffic in order to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/02/16/allfreecalls-shut-down/">exploit legislative loopholes</a>. Maybe FreeConference.com was accidentally lumped in with them and the blocking will be temporary. Maybe they all resell POTS access from the same provider, who's accidentally blacklisted freeconference.com. Or maybe not.</p>
<p>Either way, we're kind of screwed until the carriers deign to fix the problem. Our clients can't reliably call in to the service, and getting them to switch cell phone carriers is of course not a plausible solution. In fact, even for those of us who use the service daily, selecting against the crooked carriers wouldn't make any sense — termination fees, locked handsets, an occasional lack of synching tools... Yes, I can imagine a world in which consumers rise up and demand an end to these lousy practices — it's just that it's clearly a fantasy world. And I don't buy that cell customers' unwillingness to grab pitchforks and torches and march down to Cingular HQ means that we somehow don't deserve the better and more flexible service that we say we want.</p>
<p>But instead of punishing the companies that have screwed up, we'll be forced to switch conferencing providers. Which, if the freeconference.com people are to be believed, is exactly what the networks are conspiring to accomplish.</p>
<p>Now compare the situation to my VoIP vendor. If I'm using an open protocol (and, since my home Asterisk server speaks SIP, I am), the decision to switch vendors is as simple as googling for a new provider, filling out a web form and altering a configuration file to match the credentials that will have been emailed to me. That's how it ought to be: if Cingular starts screwing you over, forward your calls to the T-Mobile trial account you just set up — all it'd take is changing a few settings on your handset. If you like it, switch for good for whatever the current, reasonable number-portability fee is.</p>
<p>Is that kind of flexibility really so unimaginable? And would it be so terrible to legislate it into existence? I'm not saying we should dictate technical implementations to carriers, but surely discouraging their lockin-focused contract scheme would improve competition.</p>

                    <p>The Post's <a class="reference external" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/17/AR2007031700699.html">article on H Street</a> is getting blogged-up all over the place today. Aside from the ridiculous ending (&quot;OHHHHHH it's <em>SYMBOLIC</em>&quot;), it's pretty good. The opening struck an especially familiar note:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">A white woman and a little white girl are walking west on H Street Northeast, the 1300 block. Behind them, three black men are walking, not far behind, but close enough to invade their space, as if there is such a thing as personal space on a public sidewalk in the middle of a sunny Saturday afternoon.</div>
<div class="line">Three invisible men, residents who lived in the meantime, the in-between years when this street was desolate, neglected by the city, when some white people would not be caught walking in this block of H Street.</div>
<div class="line">One black man shouts: &quot;Ma'am, please tell your daughter she don't have to be afraid of us!&quot; The white woman turns and smiles. It is not a nervous smile. But she does not slow her pace; this does not appear to be done out of fear but is more a pace one might keep while running errands on a busy afternoon. The little girl holds the woman's right hand.</div>
<div class="line">The men continue, as if to prove something. &quot;Ma'am,&quot; one of them says again, &quot;please tell your daughter she don't have to be afraid on H Street.&quot;</div>
<div class="line">The woman climbs into an SUV and drives away.</div>

<p>I used to run into this sort of Affability Test all the time. Now that my neighborhood's a little more gentrified and I'm a little older and (hopefully) a little less bewildered-looking, it doesn't occur as much. But it still happens from time to time, and it's usually discomforting or depressing.</p>
<p>The best of these types of interactions are like the one quoted above: they're just overwhelmingly sad and plaintive. The speakers are daring you to disappoint them by failing to engage and acknowledge them. I do my best to defy that expectation with a cheerful response. But that's just self-flattery — it'd be a stretch to think that those guys don't have a good reason for their yuppie-equals-jerk heuristic. And, to be honest, I'm not usually thrilled about having to stop what I'm doing in order to cheer up and/or prove my worth to a stranger. Maybe that makes me an asshole.</p>
<p>And if it doesn't, then surely the way in which I respond does. Am I being patronizing when I pick my words, or just recalling the high school truism that a constrained vocabulary turneth away wrath? Are the subtle colloquialisms I find myself unintentionally affecting as glaringly artificial to the person I'm speaking to as they are to me? Probably, although the person on the other end of the conversation is usually very kind about it. In fact, when I find myself speaking to folks in these situations they're almost always very nice.</p>
<p>When they're not, they're generally homeless people with mental problems or young guys trying to assert their dominance in front of their friends. In those cases it's tough to know what the right note is to strike between friendliness, assertiveness and submission. Is it going to give offense or spark further engagement if I make eye contact, or if I fail to? In the case of the homeless, once I'm acknowledged as being okay how can I continue to be polite without getting sucked into a five-minute-long spiel about bus tickets that ends with me lying that I don't have any cash on me?</p>
<p>Maybe I'm just a less friendly guy than I like to think, but there's a definite edge to these interactions. I don't think I can be blamed for not wanting to be scrutinized by strangers. I haven't done anything wrong, although I know that the fact of many other people like me doing the same not-wrong things is, in aggregate, doing harm to the city's long-time, poorer residents. But what can I do about it? And what can they do, other than stop me on the street and demand answers without asking a question?</p>
<p>I don't mean to sit here and complain about being forced to interact with my fellow man. But I can't pretend to enjoy these little chats, either. Being confronted with a stranger's sadness and anger is uncomfortable, no matter how politely-expressed or justified it is.</p>

                    <p>I should've seen this one coming: I had a problem with my math in the similarity matrix stuff. I didn't think through the problem carefully enough, and failed to realize that a given representative might vote several times on a piece of legislation as various amendments and procedural votes come up. That resulted in a screwed-up data model, which resulted in taking dot products of vectors of variable length, which shouldn't have worked at all (Perl is apparently pretty forgiving about referring to variables that don't exist).</p>
<p>It still <em>sort of</em> worked, as you can tell from the graph. But it wasn't accurate, and most of the CPU time I had spent so far went to waste.</p>
<p>I think I've got it all sorted out, but I'll have to rerun all of those cosine comparisons (I've improved the algorithm's efficiency; it might take less than a day this time). But progress continues: I've also written the infrastructure for segmenting the votes by issue. I'll beat this goddamn thing yet.</p>
<p>Things aren't helped by Sunlight's data being somewhat messy. Some voting histories have multiple vote-records that have identical bills numbers, descriptions and dates. The only thing that varies, in fact, is the value of the vote that's stored. That's pretty goddamn confusing, so I'm just using the one that the page's order implies to be chronologically first and hoping for the best.</p>

                    <p>Why aren't there more reviews of leaked albums? The delay between when blogospheric buzz leads me to hear a record and its actual release date seems to have increased in the last six months. These days I frequently find myself wondering what the press thinks about the albums I'm currently most excited about, only to realize that they're abiding by the laws of the labels, not the anarchy of the internet.</p>
<p>The tradition of holding off on reviewing a CD until it's on shelves seems defensible to me. It'd be a shame to let those who have taken advantage of leaked copies hurt artists even further by depressing their sales with potentially buzz-deflating reviews. And of course the leaked product isn't always the final one, so judging an early, surreptitiously-obtained copy might be unfair. I've done it, but I'm just a lowly amateur blogger. Major reviewers seemed to respect release dates, and it seems admirable that they do.</p>
<p>But I wonder how long it'll hold. Stereogum's a blog, sure, but they've also got a gigantic audience. And they're now <a class="reference external" href="http://www.stereogum.com/archives/004811.html">making a feature</a> out of reviewing leaked albums. It seems unavoidable that the practice will seep into Pitchfork, then Rolling Stone, then, hell, I don't know — NPR?</p>
<p>At any rate, this trend seems inevitable and superficially unfortunate, but also something that musicians can probably adapt to without too much trouble. Reducing the amount of time between the end of mastering and the album's official release date is the most obvious solution, although that'll necessitate less carefully-scheduled releases. But that's probably fine, too: the only real justification for such precise timing that I'm aware of is a label's desire to stretch its releases out so that revenue stays even through the year, and so that similar acts in their stable don't step on one another's toes. Maybe there's another reason, but if there is I can't think of it at the moment.</p>
<p>I think the labels are doomed anyway, so removing their scheduling abilities isn't any great tragedy. Bands will record on their own. If they need to schedule strategically, their smaller number of personnel will make it easier to prevent leaks. More often they'll probably just release the album as soon as they can — I can't imagine that too many artists enjoy having to wait to release their work.</p>
