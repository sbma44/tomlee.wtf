                    <p>If you're in the market for project management software -- and it seems like a large portion of people working on the internet perpetually are -- let me encourage you to check out my cousin Sophia's startup, <a class="reference external" href="http://webplanner.com/pages/index.php">Webplanner</a>. I am admittedly not the world's biggest Silverlight fan, but the software seems to do a nice job of actually having something to do with projects and how they are executed (as opposed to, say, Pivotal, which has always struck me as a more awful videogame than bug tracker), while not being quite as stripped-down-to-the-point-of-frustration as Basecamp. Worth a look.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>I was glad to see <a class="reference external" href="http://timothyblee.com/2011/05/16/stephen-colberts-confused-parody-of-citizens-united/">Tim writing about Stephen Colbert's decision to start a PAC</a>. At work we've been excited to have such a high-profile figure talking about the campaign finance system -- excited enough to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sunlightfoundation/sets/72157626713576460/">dress people in bear costumes</a>, in fact.</p>
<p>But I don't think Tim gives Colbert enough credit. Yes, there are tensions within Colbert's efforts that are related to speech rights. But it's a mistake to expect Colbert to be perfectly logically consistent. I think his aim is to point out absurdities within our system -- absurdities that are to some extent the product of the contradictions Tim mentions. This undertaking can be done -- and can be useful -- without offering a solution.</p>
<p>Tim's critique also ignores the issue of disclosure, which is central to Colbert's focus on <em>Citizens United</em>, and which is the motivation behind his pursuit of a media exemption. I'm sympathetic to arguments about the importance of preserving avenues for anonymous political speech. But a good case can also be made that it is reasonable to expect those who avail themselves of privileged mediums of expression to stand by the statements they make in them. In practice if not in law I would face different obligations for a statement I whispered to a friend versus one I slapped on a billboard. I think that's reasonable.</p>
<p>Finally, Tim's post sidesteps the thorniest questions associated with distinguishing corporate speech from speech made by humans. He rightly observes that &quot;this isn't how free speech jurisprudence works&quot;, but I find that argument more depressing than compelling. The personhood question is so dreary and vast that I'm hesitant to bring it up here. But when it comes to political speech, the same culpability two-step is very much in play: like Dr. Jekyll trying to cordone his negative impulses in a separate entity, the division between an active, proudly amoral leadership and the slumbering ownership whose authority they exert often leads to bad outcomes. I think it's telling that defenders of corporate money in our system can't brook the idea of requiring that the owners of that money be forced to approve its use for political ends. It puts the lie to their protestations that corporate giving is simply a vehicle for expressing individuals' speech rights collectively.</p>
<p>Clearly, political and legal momentum are not on the side of people who feel the way I do. But our system has long acknowledged these tensions in its prohibition on direct giving from corporations to politicians. That PACs can and do launder this kind of money doesn't validate the practice.</p>
<p>Tim's point is that some of our society's legal traditions and most cherished principles demand that we not restrict corporate speech. Colbert's point is that those principles are forcing us to further empower inhuman actors whose influence on our political system may imperil our society, and perhaps even our planet. I don't think either side is wrong.</p>

                    <p>Regarding the new caps on debit card interchange fees:</p>
<blockquote>
TechNet said the loss of revenue to banks and card networks could lead them to cut costs in the technology systems that protect personal financial information from fraud and identity theft.</blockquote>
<p>You have to sort of admire the brazenness of this threat. I mean really: that's astounding.</p>
<p>I guess I've seen enough frightening ads on Metro to be convinced that this really is just a transfer from banks to merchants. But hey, that seems okay! Particularly given banks' ongoing profitability relative to everyone else, their continued lack of punishment, and the concentration in the payment processing market.</p>
<p>Besides, won't merchants just turn right around and send that money into the supposedly-loss-leading (but I suspect just loss-???ing) &quot;online coupon site&quot; bubble, which will then <a class="reference external" href="http://mashable.com/2011/04/13/livingsocial-1-dollar-lunches/">distribute it to consumers</a> during whatever time is left between now and the conclusion of that sector's frantic race to the bottom?

                    <p>At my last job, everyone was an architect. Software architects, information architects, perhaps solution architects -- I don't remember all of them, to be honest. It was a little silly, but also kind of sweet: it reflected a desire to treat everyone at the firm in an equal way, and was an effort to recognize each person's creative contribution. When I left I was both a little bit relieved and a little bit sad to lost my nominal architect status.</p>

                    <p>I'm heading to the beach on Monday, which means that the beard had to go. &nbsp;I don't know when it might return -- certainly not for a long time. &nbsp;It was fun, but I think I'm probably just not cut out to operate a beard at a professional level. &nbsp;Ah well.</p>
<p>Of course, there was still the question of how to shave it off. &nbsp;Usually this is taken as an opportunity to briefly sport some funny or Wolverine-related facial hair configurations, but I decided I'd waste even more time and nerd it up a bit.</p>

                    <p>Yes, yes, the song is awful, and internet commenters are mean, and she's very <a class="reference external" href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/monkeysee/2011/03/18/134652534/ridiculed-youtube-singer-rebecca-black-grabs-a-mountain-of-bull-by-the-horns?ft=1&amp;f=93568166">inspiring</a>, etc. &nbsp;But what about the <em>technology</em>?</p>
<p>That seems to me to be the interesting part. &nbsp;Because while a lot of people are going on about the crappiness of the video, it seems clear that this would not have become the internet meme it is unless it crossed <em>some</em> threshold for plausibly professional production (embarrassing webcam karaoke might be mocked, but not to this degree). &nbsp;Certainly when I first saw the video last weekend, having never heard of Rebecca Black, I simply assumed that she was some new tween sensation whose handlers had created an unutterably condescending and awful new product to sell to prepubescent dopes.</p>
<p>But it turns out that the video is basically a high-class version of the karaoke booths at Six Flags where you can pay to be videotaped in front of a green screen. &nbsp;Sure, the edge-detection effect that opens the video is lame, and all the fake depth of field stuff is off-putting, and the autotuning is obvious. &nbsp;But isn't it... believable? &nbsp;Isn't it kind of amazing how well a fly-by-night effects company was able to ape what was the state of the art in pop music videos not so long ago? &nbsp;Perhaps I'm wrong about the costs, but the utter disposability of the song -- and Black's acknowledgement that she didn't like it even while recording it -- indicates that this was not a huge investment for her family. &nbsp;In other words: I suspect we're looking at a budget in the low single-digit thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>Maybe I'm wrong and this is a case of fantastically rich parents and/or some strange social failure that forestalled any effort at quality control. &nbsp;But preliminarily, I'm pretty impressed by the level of polish that can now be achieved without -- clearly -- anybody involved being able to muster the enthusiasm to give a damn.</p>

                    <p>I guess it's serendipity that&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/2011/03/huckabee-romney-and-the-beast/">this post</a> showed up over at Yglesias's blog this morning. &nbsp;It discusses a paper that argues that deficits actually lead to more demand for government, as shifting costs to the future lowers the public's sense of the cost of government services, prompting them to consume more. &nbsp;This doesn't seem very controversial to me (or at least I'm not qualified to say anything interesting about it).</p>
<p>But just yesterday I was thinking about something very similar in the context of the <a class="reference external" href="http://arstechnica.com/software/news/2011/03/twitter-tells-third-party-devs-to-stop-making-twitter-client-apps.ars">current storm</a> over Twitter. &nbsp;Not so much because of the specific question of how much Twitter client variety we'll see, but the larger question of the firm beginning to make decisions that will help it generate revenue rather than decisions that will help it generate user adoption.</p>
<p>And it occurred to me that we basically debt finance our social networks. &nbsp;There are a&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://pinboard.in/signup/">few</a> <a class="reference external" href="http://www.metafilter.com/newuser.mefi">exceptions</a>, but in general nobody's willing to pay for social experiences on the web. &nbsp;So instead we've arrived at a model where open registration, open APIs and open bars at SXSW are used to attract users. &nbsp;Then, once network effects have given the experience value, and so long as transition costs remain inconveniently high, value can be extracted from those users. &nbsp;Lots of people tell lots of stories about how this can be a positive-sum interaction (usually fairytales about how valuable anonymous usage data is, or how people will suddenly start enjoying the experience of looking at ads if the sales pitch is sufficiently personalized). &nbsp;But in practice it seems to always be the case that user experience is degraded in some way.</p>
<p>This isn't a particularly great insight, I suppose: that you can goose demand if you shift costs into the future. &nbsp;Discount rates exist; it's why economists fret about declines in consumer borrowing. &nbsp;It's why people still smoke cigarettes.</p>
<p>I have an aesthetic aversion to it -- a general sense that things would be <em>better</em> if costs were presented up front. &nbsp;That it would be preferable for Twitter to be a protocol like email rather than a service like Facebook. &nbsp;Maybe even that it would be more&nbsp;<em>moral</em> for them to be. &nbsp;That the costs associated with transitioning between social networks every, what, five years are high enough to be worth complaining about.*</p>
<p>But this is probably is just a meaningless prejudice on part. &nbsp;Twitter wouldn't have become Twitter if those costs had been apparent from the start. &nbsp;To wish it could be otherwise is just to say that you want foolish angel investors to buy you toys for free**. &nbsp;The service will probably remain fine for a long time, and then it'll get worse, and we'll all bitch about it and eventually something else will come along.</p>
<p>I just hope that when Google finally decides it needs to make some money off Gmail that they have the class to ask me for it to my face instead of creating some privacy-violating Rube Goldberg device by which other corporations agree to exchange money for making my life very slightly worse, as if I was plugged into the Matrix to power cybernetic tyrants with my mild irritation.</p>
<p>* Whatever this inclination is, it's closely related to the sense I have that mobile vendors shouldn't use contracts to subsidize handsets, and that cable TV should be a la carte, and that bandwidth should be billed on a metered basis. &nbsp;In all cases these &quot;innovations&quot; probably facilitate commercial activity that's desirable, but I'd be happy enough to see it disappear simply to avoid the sense that people are being duped. &nbsp;I guess it's just pique.</p>
<p>** To be clear, I'm in favor of this.</p>

                    <p>My grandfather was no slouch: he was a Rhodes Scholar and had successful careers in the foreign service and pharmaceutical industry. &nbsp;But that's not what I remember him for. &nbsp;Instead I think about his absent-minded professorial air; his tendency to try to repair everything with epoxy; his fondness for hollering out <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aura_Lea">Aura Lee</a> after too many sherries; his kindness, which was so profound that it -- and it alone -- could bridge the bitterness of his kids' divorces. &nbsp;Part of the reason these traits took the foreground was that he was by nature a humble guy. &nbsp;But a big part was that he happily shared a stage with my grandmother.</p>
<p>She was an incredibly impressive woman -- possessed of a forceful mind, a New Englander's unshakable belief in liberal values, and a sharp sense of humor. &nbsp;Recently my aunt sent me an interview that she'd just discovered, in which my grandmother spoke frankly about her life as a foreign service officer's wife (very much a career in its own right); her experiences being stationed in Senegal, New Zealand, Australia, Jamaica, Iceland and Belgium; her sense of Europeans' comparative drinking habits; and our family's run-in with some of the worst of the McCarthy era. &nbsp;I think it captures a lot of what made her so great. &nbsp;Maybe it won't be of interest to anyone else, but believe me: if you'd known her, you'd be rapt.</p>

<p><em>The Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training Foreign Affairs Oral History Program Foreign Service Spouse Series</em></p>
<p>Interviewed by: Jewell Fenzi and Patricia Squire</p>
<p>Initial interview date: May 30, 1990</p>
<p>LEE: Before you're allowed to vote in Vermont, you take the &quot;freeman's oath,&quot; and there's a feeling in the state that everybody is equal to everybody else. I knew nothing about the Foreign Service, and when I entered it, in the year 1941, and discovered how hierarchical it was, and the whole system extended to wives who were expected to work for their country for nothing and were placed under the bidding and supervision of &quot;more superior&quot; wives, I thought the whole thing was simply abhorrent.</p>
<p>I wasn't bothered at the first post, Toronto, which was a trading post. The chief of mission, the Consul General, interested me because he was an Edwardian snob and I had never met one, outside of literature. I thought he was vaguely amusing, and his wife was a rather gentle lady for whom I felt some compassion. And some of the senior wives were very kind to me and spared my feelings, so I didn't suffer too much.</p>
<p>But as I look back on it, I realize that it was a very unhappy post. At that time there was a distinction between the career and non-career services, and he made a bloody distinction between the two services. Several people drank too much at that post; one man committed suicide. It was an unhappy post and the values of the senior officer just poor, meretricious. My husband kept saying, &quot;Oh, you mustn't judge the Foreign Service by this, just wait till we get our next post.&quot;</p>
<p>We were commissioned in March 1942, so this was very early after we entered World War II. I was packing mobile libraries for the Imperial Order of Daughters of the Empire before we entered the war. A rather amusing incident: as I was packing away busily down at their main headquarters, I heard somebody ask, &quot;Who is she?&quot; I realized they were referring to me. The other woman said, &quot;She's an American.&quot; There was a pause, then the first lady said, &quot;You know, you can't trust them. They invaded us once and they'll do it again.&quot; (hearty laughter)</p>
<p>Well, war was declared and then there was this problem with the last class at the Foreign Service. They were frozen. Armistead was frozen in along with other members of his class and no more young men were taken in, they all had to be taken into the armed forces.</p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): So since he was frozen into the Foreign Service, they couldn't take him into the military?</em></p>
<p>LEE: That's right. But they felt it was only fair for these young men who were frozen in to send them to about the most unpleasant posts they could think of, which I think was probably fair enough. And the post they picked for Army was Dakar, in what was then French West Africa, now Senegal. He was to go in a convoy. By this time I was pregnant and what every young woman did during this period was to go home to mother and father, and it never occurred to any of us that they weren't wildly happy to have us. (both laugh heartily)</p>
<p>I went up to Vermont where my father, by now retired, was running the family farm, and Armistead went to Washington. They discussed his situation and my pregnancy and finally decided -- the baby was due early in November -- to give him compassionate leave of two weeks, which was very nice. So he came up to Westford, and every morning when I appeared at breakfast, three pairs of eyes looked at me accusingly. Nothing happened. His two weeks were used up and he had to go back to Newport News to the convoy. It was rather ticklish because this particular convoy had been sunk on its last trip across the Atlantic. I still produced no baby.</p>
<p>Just at that time the most ferocious snowstorm that Vermont had ever had early in November came, and the Westfortown fathers had neglected to fix an important part of the snowplow; which doesn't sound like Vermont, but this [was] what happened. So the snow snowed up to the windows and over part of them, the most depressing snowstorm I've ever seen. I called my obstetrician, who said, &quot;Well, if you can't get out, I'll phone in the instructions.&quot; My mother said, weakly, &quot;To whom?&quot; (hearty laughs)</p>
<p>Neighbors called and said, &quot;We'll get ox teams out, we'll do everything to get her out.&quot; But for three days I was caught there. Fortunately the baby remained quiet. On the last day they got the snowplow fixed and I went out in a sort of cortege -- there were l4 milk trucks and a great big dump truck from Si Parree [phonetic] and I was in the front seat with him, he evidently terrified that I was going to have the baby en route to Burlington. But we got there all right. Indeed I was there two days before the baby came.</p>
<p>At the very last minute, just as the convoy was going to shove off, Armistead called from the ship: he'd asked permission and the captain said, &quot;I'm sitting here with my gun and if you make one false move I'll shoot you.&quot; He had been sunk in a convoy previously and was taking no chances. So Armi called. He couldn't reach the house but of course everybody was on the same telephone line in Westford, Vermont, and somebody spoke up and said, &quot;I think you'll find her aunt at home.&quot; He called my aunt and explained who he was and she was able to tell him that our daughter had been born. And he went off to Africa.</p>
<p>I stayed in Vermont until the baby was about 11 months old. I was making plans to get to Dakar, and nobody during war times was allowed to fly out of the United States unless you were military. There were all kinds of difficulties -- I couldn't even get my shots for yellow fever and all the other things you had to have for Africa. I had to go down to 90 Church Street in New York City, so I went down and stayed with a sister-in-law who lived in New Jersey, my brother then being back in Washington in the Navy. I was nursing the baby, she was then about three months old, and then would race into the city. If there wasn't too much brass ahead of me, I would get my shots and race back in time to feed the baby.</p>
<p>Then I had to arrange to send out baby food. So I was in communication with baby food manufacturers. The rules forbade glass jars because they didn't want to pack glass; it was very difficult to get metal jars because of the war. Finally I was able to order l,300 cans of assorted baby food and breathed a sigh of relief and thought, &quot;Well, we're getting things cleared away.&quot; Armi's last words had been, &quot;It's going to be a cinch your getting to Africa.&quot; (they laugh heartily)</p>
<p>The telephone rang one day. It was the salesman I'd worked with on baby food. He said, &quot;There's been a little glitch on the baby food. We can produce the l,300 cans but they're all spinach.&quot; (both break down; after a while she resumes) I said, &quot;You have to be kidding.&quot; And we had an exchange of some rather hot words, and he said, &quot;Well, I'll go back and see what I can do.&quot; I finally did get the baby food and it was sent off to Africa.</p>
<p>When it arrived -- Dakar was a very &quot;wartime post&quot; -- the wife of the British I don't know what his status was but she was the ranking wife, saw on the bill of lading that these puréed things had come in and she said, &quot;Oh goody, we'll make soups out of them.&quot; So she began to work out of my baby food before Armistead was able to discover that the food had arrived and could stop it. We lost some cans that way.</p>
<p>Finally I got passage on the first ship allowed out, a neutral Portuguese ship bound for Lisbon. From Lisbon I could get a plane to Dakar. The ship was the Lorenzo Mark[phon. sp.]; they'd been about to scuttle her when the War broke out and saved her. They charged an enormous amount of money, it was dreadful, and I had arranged with them that there would be baby food on board, and canned milk, everything was just fine. And I got down to the ship and discovered they had no baby food on board and no tinned milk whatsoever. (she laughs) So I flew to the phone. Armistead had a cousin who lived near Newport News. I explained the situation. It was SundaHe said, &quot;I know a grocer, I'll get in and come down on the dock.&quot; Sure enough, about four hours later sirens screamed and military police were saying, &quot;Hey, you can't go there&quot; and Blair Lee came down. He had baby food, he had a strainer, a can opener, milk, (laughing) he had everything. My child was the only one who didn't have dysentery and wasn't sick on this 17-day voyage across the Atlantic.</p>
<p>We were nighted of course and proceeded very calmly and slowly. Wahwee MacArthur, Ambassador MacArthur's wife -- she was Alben Barkley's daughter, the wife of (I believe) a Third Secretary, I'm not sure -- dressed somewhat like a retired spy but she was very pleasant. I was quite unprepared for her apotheosis when she became the Ambassador's wife and became so desperately unpleasant.</p>
<p>We just sort of sat it out. The food on board was terrible. When I got to Lisbon we were about to disembark, I was packing, little Norie, who had a tendency to put things in her mouth -- you remember the round dental-floss holder? -- she swallowed it before I could stop her and it caught in her throat. She started to turn blue. All I could think of was, &quot;I've brought this baby this far and I'll have a dead child for Africa.&quot; I tried to dislodge it, I tipped her upside down, my hand was in her throat, and then I started up the stairs to the ship's doctor. He was a little perfumed rather dark Portuguese gentleman. I roared into his office and just as I got in a flood came down the front of me and the thing came out of her throat. I said there with this screaming child and the nice little man patted me. &quot;I'll give you something, Mrs. Lee,&quot; he said, &quot;the baby's all right.&quot; I've always remembered him with great affection.</p>
<p>BUT I was not looking like a very chic Foreign Service wife. The mother of Lisa Green, the wife of our Ambassador to Portugal, was down at the dock to meet us, (she stops for hearty laughing) which I thought was very bad luck. Mrs. Crocker was down there. Well, we were sort of newsworthy, because we were the first boat that had come across, I guess. I was feeling rather miserable. Suddenly a voice spoke from the dock. &quot;Are you Eleanore Lee?&quot; I said that I was. &quot;Well, your husband has sent me to look after you.&quot; This was a young man from the Embassy who had some reason to go to Dakar, and Armi said, &quot;By the way, my wife's coming through.&quot; Well, this paragon took me to the hotel, speaking fluent Portuguese. He had a maid who loved babies, he took me around Lisbon, and he got me on the plane for Dakar.</p>
<p>That was no small feat: the State Department had made an error in my papers and there was the fine little bureaucrat at the airport who said, &quot;She can't go without this paper!&quot; He argued and cajoled and got me on the plane.</p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): Was he in the Foreign Service?</em></p>
<p>LEE: Well, yes and no. He was a legal type. Armi nearly died when I explained one of my conversations with the young man. He asked me what I thought of the FBI. It was dealing, I thought rather unjustly, with people who were being accused of being &quot;unAmerican&quot; or &quot;Communists.&quot; So I let fly about the FBI and explained that I didn't think they used very good judgment. Armi said, &quot;Didn't you know that legal attachés were invariably FBI?&quot; (both laugh heartily) It didn't seem to make any difference, he still was very nice to me.</p>
<p>When I boarded the Clipper [plane] ship this nice American boy said, &quot;Give me the baby, she got a bottle, I'll give it to her.&quot; And when we arrived at Dakar, of course I had to go through a battery of French officials. One of them said, &quot;Madame Lee, the port is closed with bubonic plague.&quot; Then he looked at my passport, and sai(imitating awed tone of voice) &quot;Ah, Madame, you have a diplomatic passport. Entrez!&quot; So our first trip was to the Air Force Hospital. Actually one reason why we felt that I could come with the baby was because there was a very good American Air Force hospital there.</p>
<p>Dakar had a great deal of misery, I saw elephantiasis and leprosy and just terrible illness and wretchedness there. But there were several doctors at the American hospital who wanted to be baby doctors and hadn't seen babies for a long time, so we got very good attention.</p>
<p>We settled into a little house across from the Consulate General. It was rather better furnished than most houses in Dakar then. Our predecessor had won two chairs in poker game on a ship, leather chairs still with the bolts on that bolted them down. And Armi had made a sofa out of a car seat with a Mauretanian blanket. So we were rather spiffy. We had a dining room table and I think five or six chairs that matched it; I don't recall where they came from.</p>
<p>I remember the first party we gave, the whole doorway, screen and all, fell over the entering guests' head. The termites had eaten it. When it rained, we had to wear rubbers to get from the front of the house into the sleeping quarters because the roof had never been fixed. Now and then I read things from home about cookie-pushers in the Foreign Service having this life of terrible eas(laughing) while the rest of the world was wracked with pain.</p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): Was this as amusing at the time as it is now?</em></p>
<p>LEE: Well, I didn't mind this very much. I can remember pushing Norie early in the morning in a pram and thinking, &quot;What am I doing here, in the heart of Africa?&quot;</p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): You talked about the drums, too.</em></p>
<p>LEE: Yes. In the Medina you'd hear the drums. It was a little bit menacing. There was a marvelous beach at Yaw.... where occasionally we could go. They had an enormous black swimmer there, he must have been six feet six, whom the Army hired to watch -- the surf was terrific and if you got too far out he would race out and get you. It was a beautiful place.</p>
<p>Our Consul General, who is now dead, was a really dreadful man. This was my second experiencwith [an Edwardian snob]! (finishing the sentence with a laugh) He hated the tropics, they really made him feel quite unreal. He drank a great deal. He disliked blacks intensely, he didn't like the French much; and there he was.</p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): Sounds like an ideal choice for Dakar.</em></p>
<p>LEE: So Dakar was a great post for him. He was intemperate and choleric. When I was offered a chance to teach in a lycée, they'd been without one for a long time. And I didn't dream of asking for money, I'd learned that you mustn't have any money for what you did in the Foreign Service. It was a volunteer position. Mr. Wilkinson called me over and said, &quot;I can't keep you from taking this job but I'll break your husband if you take it.&quot;</p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): This was a volunteer job, teaching English in a French school.</em></p>
<p>LEE: That's right.</p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): Why did he feel so strongly?</em></p>
<p>LEE: Well, I don't think he liked women. He had been married. Halways referred to his wife as &quot;that wretched woman &quot;. He had had a mistress in Germany, been utterly happy in Germany, the Germans knew how to run things properly. I think that he just felt he wasn't going to allow anything he didn't want; he was boss. Five people at that post paid their way to get home and out from under him. He was really a pretty dreadful man. There was an awfully nice young naval officer who was an alcoholic who was trying to stay off alcohol, and he tempted him. It made him feel superior to see Dick get drunk. He just was the sort of man who should not have been in the Foreign Service.</p>
<p>The thing that appalled me was that when the inspectors came out -- a very nice inspector came out when I was there, he knew that this was a bad person who shouldn't be in the job -- nothing was done about it.</p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): The old-boy network.</em></p>
<p>LEE: It was the old-boy network, and it just seemed to me that people were allowed to be unpleasant and uncivil and incompetent. When we had official parties -- the mayor of Dakar was a coal-black Senegalese who was a graduate of the Sorbonne, one of the men on the supreme bench whatever they called it was another black -- they were never invited. You can imagine what damage this did to us. So, that was my &quot;second experience.&quot;</p>
<p>Then we were moved to Australia. The first problem with the State Department was, they didn't see why I shouldn't precede Armi and go with a small child to Australia on my own and find a house while he went back and be a consultant at the Department. The Departmen(she laughs) would save a little money. We finally argued them out of that ...</p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): This was right after the war?</em></p>
<p>LEE: Yes. So we took a ship which had been a transport ship of some kind. Marshall and Lisa Greewere on that ship. From the United States, we were going to Australia and they were going to New Zealand. You see, I'd finally said I just wouldn't go to Australia, couldn't possibly; and Armistead raised enough of a shriek so they finally relented. We berthed the ship at New Zealand first en route to Australia and the New Zealand war brides came on in droves. Some of them had babies, they'd been separated from their men who'd gone back to the States to be demobbed, and their parents were there on the dock, weeping, and the girls were crying and the babies were yelling. It was quite a scene. These poor girls finally got on the ship and we got under way. Wishing to be terribly nice to these young women, they ordered up tea for all these young girls. The tea came: lukewarm water and teabags. They burst into tears again! (hearty laughter) I've always remembered that.</p>
<p>So we dropped them off at New Zealand and went on to Australia. We had to go to a hotel, which happened to be a very good one, in downtown Melbourne. We could stay there only three days. It seems to me MacArthur was coming through with an entourage, preempting all the hotel space. After a three-day search we found this obscure place way out in the boondocks. They said they didn't have a crib for the baby, so three of us slept in one bed. It's miraculous how much space a small child takes in a bed -- she had all the bed. I remember it was freezing cold. I finally found a little room with a little fire, and two crones bending over it rubbing their arthritic hands, and one of them saying, &quot;I wouldn't have central heating. It's weakening.&quot; (heavy laughter)</p>
<p>Finally we found a house, we rented one near Heidelberg, a lovely part outside Melbourne, on Brooke Street, with the most marvelous neighbors whom we stayed in touch with all the rest of their lives; most of them are no longer living. A wonderful woman lived across the street who had three children. At that time I had only the one, and I felt that she taught me so much about being a parent. Then a neighbor whom I'd not met called up out of the blue, I thought this was so very Australian, introducing herself on the telephone. She said, &quot;I'd like to give a tea for you&quot; and told me how to reach her house, in walking distance. As I walked up the driveway my heart sank: I smelled coffee, and thought, &quot;I'm afraid she's having coffee for me.&quot; Sure enough, in the dining room there was tea at one end and coffee at the other. &quot;Which will you have, Mrs. Lee?&quot; she asked. Aware that I was a diplomat's wife, I said, &quot;Oh, the coffee. Thank you so much.&quot; It was the most nauseous brew I've ever tasted in my life, and she said, &quot;Will you have another cup?&quot; And doing my best for my country, I said, (breaking up between phrases) &quot;Yes, it's delicious,&quot; and she said, &quot;I do think it's the mustard.&quot; (both break up completely)</p>
<p>She was a marvelous young woman, and she had an en tout cas tennis court and I played tennis there. I discovered these Australian women were born with tennis racquets in their hands and I just had a marvelous time. I remember Australia with so much love and affection. I've often said if I couldn't live in my own country, I'd go back to Australia.</p>
<p>As for the officer in charge, the third one in my life: well, he was civil, really very civil, and his wife was very nice. But I ran into trouble at the very beginning because I was the only career wife there. Before I came, the non-career wives -- this is something people today wouldn't know anything about -- got together. These wives hadn't met me, hadn't heard anything about me, and decided that I would be absolutely impossible. By looking up the book, they found some obscure rule that they could have the chauffeur drop all their cards at the hotel and wouldn't, any of them, follow up. So nobody called on me, and I was alone with a child at this post and nobody called.</p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): And there must have been only a few people.</em></p>
<p>LEE: It wasn't a big post. There were about five of them, and they got together and made decisions. (laughing) When we got into our house, I made personal calls on all these wretched women. They never really liked me. When the new people came in and I met them at train, boat or plane, it was different then. But really our happiness in Australia was because of the Australians.</p>
<p>The Chief of Mission was not really interested in ideas or diplomacy. He was interested in the Foreign Service, and his wife was interested in the protocol. She was really a very sweet woman but I irritateher. I lost a baby because of a miscarriage in Australia. I managed to get pregnant again but the doctor said, &quot;You'd better not stand a lot of time.&quot; So when the Fourth of July thing came along, she wanted Armi and me to stand. I said Armi would love to but the doctor said I'd better not do it. She said, &quot;My dear, it's your country.&quot; I, unfortunately, laughed, it was so absurd, and it hurt her feelings; I was sorry about that.</p>
<p>So that was our third chief officer. I hadn't met anybody, at that point, that I thought was intellectually very stimulating or impressive. And I thought, &quot;What goes in the Foreign Service?&quot; I'd been in, now, about six years. I'd met some junior officers that I thought were really terrific, but I hadn't met anybody &quot;up there.&quot; (she laughs)</p>
<p>Then we went to New Zealand. I was expecting a baby any minute and the doctor had advised the State Department that I should not be moved because of my past history. The State Department said, &quot;It won't hurt her a bit&quot; and moved me. So I had a new doctor and a new hospital and they were righ(she laughs) -- nothing happened. But who was at the plane to meet us? John Stewart Service. Who made our bed and arranged the food in the cupboards in the place we stayed until we got a house? Caroline Service. He was DCM, there being no Ambassador at the moment. So that was my introduction to the Services. Over the years as I look back over all of the people I've known in the Foreign Service, Jack Service was the most intelligent, the most capable, the most wonderful Foreign Service Officer that I ever met. And of course he was crucified by the Service?</p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): Crucified by the Service?</em></p>
<p>LEE: Well, he had a lot of loyal friends but I was thinking of Dulles who came in at the end and used his position to do his best to destroy Jack. No: you're right to correct me, because Jack had many loyal friends but unfortunately they weren't in the highest offices. I don't remember how long the Services were in New Zealand. I think he was transferred to India and she went there with the children, as I recall. Then he was recalled back to Washington to face the charges. That was a very sad period, and you've talked about it with Caroline.</p>
<p>Pretty soon our Ambassador came, Ambassador Scotten. He was not a mental giant. She was fascinating, very chic, with a sort of French glamor, who had evidently grown up with a lot of money and had hardly drawn her own bath water. She came to New Zealand and it was quite a shock. But it was interesting to see -- she was a very intelligent woman, more so I thought than her husband -- and she had a nervous tic and had been having illnesses. Suddenly she called me one day, saying, &quot;I've been asked to give a talk on the League of Women Voters. Can you tell me something about them?&quot; So I told her about the League. Then she was asked to be in a play. She'd never done any of these things and she had a whale of a good time. Her health got better. And she had a very tender heart, she was a very nice person.</p>
<p>That was a very happy post. It was a small Embassy and fortunately everybody liked everybody else. We kept in touch with one another over the years and it worked out very well.</p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): You mentioned curtseying.</em></p>
<p>LEE:(laughing) Oh yes. The representative of the Crown came and a big reception was held at Government House for Governor-General Freiburg, who had been a very fine head of the Anzac forces during the War. He represented the Labor Party, I think. New Zealand is incredibly democratic, wonderfully so. Unfortunately, our Ambassador decided that we should all curtsey. Having grown up in Vermont, and having taken the Freeman's Oath, I said, &quot;I just think this is a very bad idea. We're not servants of the Crown. Curtseying is an act of abasement and we shouldn't do it.&quot; But I was overruled. I gather that a ruling has now been handed down that Americans never do curtsey to Royalty. So I was right! But anyway, I gave a very unstandard curtsey. Howard Elving, the very nice Counselor of Embassy, said, &quot;That wasn't much of a curtsey, Eleanore.&quot; (she laughs) &quot;Well, it's the best I can do,&quot; I said.</p>
<p>I remember a Canadian saying to me, &quot;If you're not going to curtsey, I'm not going to either.&quot; So at the end of the line, I didn't curtsey, and she didn't. I had said to my husband, &quot;I just don't want to curtsey, I don't feel I should,&quot; and Armi would get this plaintive look and say, &quot;Well, of course there's my career.&quot; (both laughing) But we had this understanding if something really important came up, he would not insist in humiliating me. When we were at Brussels and the wife of the DCM and some other wives were really humiliated by the Ambassador's wife -- you know I just felt that these husbands ...</p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): You were there with Mrs. MacArthur?</em></p>
<p>LEE: Yes. And she was a Medea. I think she was a desperately unhappy woman, that's the only way I can figure it.</p>
<p><em>Q (SQUIRE): And she followed a perfectly lovely lady, Mrs. Burden, who was a Vanderbilt, a lady.</em></p>
<p>LEE: They would invite you to some function which you ought to go to anyway and you'd go and she'd thank you, and then she'd walk you out to the car afterwards. I remember Thanksgiving, when they invited [everyone] to a Thankgsviging dinner and the DCM went to her and said, &quot;You know, most of them probably want to be home with their children then, Mrs. Burden.&quot; He was really belling the cat, because he was fond of her. And she said, &quot;Oh, I never thought of that, of course they don't have to come if they don't want to.&quot; She was just so anxious always, so sweet and nice. And then to have this crew come sweeping in. He kept talking about &quot;the taut ship,&quot; he was going to run by God a t-a-u-t ship. And everybody just hated his guts.</p>
<p><em>Q (SQUIRE): So he was that way too and didn't see anything amiss with her behavior.</em></p>
<p>LEE: Evidently not. I don't know what they did in the quiet of their bedroom, I'm sure. I expect they must have had some words, but they were both unpleasant people.</p>
<p><em>Q (SQUIRE): He called everybody &quot;girl,&quot; which nearly drove the head of the Political section, this marvelous lady named Margaret Tibbetts, up the wall to be called &quot;hello girl.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): Oh yes: she was one of the very early women in the Foreign Service.</em></p>
<p>LEE: And she was marvelous, really a wonderful mind. You haven't taped her, have you? (Fenzi says no) I have a nice story about her. She came home and President Johnson appointed her Ambassador to Norway. It was in the wintertime, she came from Maine, her deceased father was a doctor and her widowed mother lived in Maine. She called up one very snowy day when New England was engulfed in storm, and said, &quot;Mother, I've got great news to tell you.&quot; And her mother said, &quot;Margaret Rose, that's lovely but I've got wonderful news to tell you.&quot; Margaret said, &quot;The President has just made me Ambassador to Norway.&quot; And her mother said, (she imitates cozy tone of voice) &quot;Well Margaret that's fine but do you know we've got 42 inches of snow?&quot; Tibbetts was supposedly going to Finland first, but the Finns turned her down because a lot of business is done in the sauna. I think Norway was a more pleasant experience.</p>
<p>I think I'll go back to Jamaica. We had a home assignment. This was where I began to hear more and more about McCarthy. I can remember taking Rebecca, our pre-school child, [to] Phoebe Hearst's school, we lived in DC at 35th Street, and talking with some indignation about what McCarthy was doing. A Foreign Service wife was there and said, &quot;You mustn't say these things out loud.&quot; This horrified me further, becaused it seemed to me it was a time when Americans should say a good many things out loud, and the louder the better it would be. But we began to be aware how dangerous the climate was in the United States.</p>
<p>We had indeed while still in New Zealand begun to be aware, because some very unpleasant things had happened. An authority in New Zealand on some subject, I've forgotten what, had been asked for by an American institution which needed his expertise. The FBI or the CIA or somebody had discovered that this expert's father had belonged to the New Zealand Communist party. The expert himself had never been a Communist, had no sympathy for it though he was friendly with his father -- you know how it is in New Zealand and Australia. This man was debarred from the United States even though it was in our interest for him to come. It was just one of those silly things that went on during this tense time.</p>
<p>Then we ran into a rather heartbreaking situation. Armistead's brother, Duncan Lee, had been with the OSS, later the CIA, and his wife, whom he'd met at Oxford, were accused by Elizabeth Bentley of being secret members of the Communist Party. We opened the New York Times one morning and there was Duncan's picture on the front page. Duncan never took the Fifth Amendment and denied that he was a member a Party member. Knowing Duncan that it was absolutely inconceivable that he was.</p>
<p>Then the State Department bored in on Armistead. &quot;What can you tell us about your brother, what can you say about your brother?&quot; Armistead's reply was, &quot;I have nothing to say about my brother except I know about his loyalty in the Service.&quot; That was put in his record as being rather sinister. Duncan always felt that Armistead suffered in some of these years.</p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): You said that State Department bored in, it must have been because McCarthy was putting pressure on -- who was Secretary of State then?</em></p>
<p>LEE: Dulles came in later. But you see, there was a security group in the Department whose duty it was to root out subversives, and these people were almost mindless. They began to count numbers -- you could find so-many people, it accrued to your benefit and to your record and it pleased some of the more dreadful Senators we had to see these names come out. It was a very sad time. And then there were people who were trying to prove their patriotism in the State Department, and they would write reports and it was whether so-and-so was &quot;possibly subversive.&quot;</p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): You really couldn't trust your colleagues, people who had been friends.</em></p>
<p>LEE: And Armi had been to Oxford too, he was a Rhodes Scholar, and there were questions about -- actually, the Chicago Tribune ran a frontpage story about Rhodes scholars, saying probably their loyalty wasn't to the United States at all anyway, it was probably to England. Which is absurd.Q (FENZI): Do you have a copy of that?</p>
<p>LEE: Probably somewhere. But it was a terrible blow to Armi's parents. His father was an Episcopal minister and his mother was a rather extraordinary woman and they were ... [End of side A, tape l; Begin side B, tape l]...[because of some doubt where preceding side of tape had ended, they repeat anecdote about Tibbetts, and Lee's initial remarks about her brother-in-law and accusation by Bentley]</p>
<p>... actually was in OSS, he flew the Hum[China-Burma-India theater of WWII]. He'd also been a Rhodes Scholar and at Oxford, met and married Ishbel and returned to the States. He was in the plane that went down with Eric Sevareid, did you remember that? They had to bail out; and Duncan had never been in a parachute before -- I'm sure I would have put my arms around the engine and gone down with the plane. They landed and one man was killed. They were in headhunting territory, in jungle. One of then was leading them out and they met a headhunter. He didn't know quite how one addressed a headhunter, all he knew was what he'd read in James Fenimore Cooper. So he raised his right hand and said, &quot;How!&quot;</p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): Where did this plane go down?</em></p>
<p>LEE: I really don't know -- New Guinea? It was sort of Malaysia, and they found a archetypical romantic British officer living with his bathtub and tent and a dressing-for-dinner person who knew all about the area, who finally helped them and they got out. This was very exciting. But anyway, Duncan was accused by Elizabeth Bentley whom they'd met socially in Washington of being a member of the Communist Party and this is what hit the front page of the New York Times. I was told by a newspaperman that actually the FBI it would be -- he was OSS and a member of the CIA, and the FBI was evidently looking into this sort of thing, and they felt even more upset over Ishbel, I suppose thinking she was an alien, and everybody &quot;knew&quot; that British intellectuals were all risky people.</p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): So she couldn't come into this country.</em></p>
<p>LEE: Well, she was here. Something else happened. You can never clear yourself when you've been accused. Duncan didn't take the Fifth, and he testified, and he told how he knew Elizabeth Bentley. Actually the things that she said Duncan had told her he couldn't possibly have told her because they were outside his perimeter somehow. Anyway, he had these black marks against him. And then Armistead was approached by the security section of the State Department asking him about his own career and his own beliefs, and what could he tell about his brother -- to testify against his brother. This really riled Armistead very much, and he responded in a haughty manner. When we finally got Armi's file from the FBI, it's full of black marks.</p>
<p>And there's one charge in it that he went down to Chatham Hall, a girls' school in Virginia where his father had been headmaster, and he'd come back from the Soviet Union and had a hammer and sickle in his buttonhole and gave this marvelously glorified picture of the Soviet Union and how wonderful it was. And that was in his file. Armistead has never been to the Soviet Union in his life, never gave a talk down at Chatham Hall. It's just absolutely made up of whole cloth. But I'm sure this happened to a lot of other people too.</p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): You alluded to the security people beginning to think in numbers. (a cautionary repetition of last part of Side A)</em></p>
<p>LEE: Yes. They wanted to show how efficient they were, so they began lookling into all sorts of things and trying to rack up kills. There were people in the Foreign Service who were not craven, who stood out against this but you can understand how in a place like Germany, for instance, under the Nazis why so many people folded, and why so many people folded in Romania. When you're going to be persecuted or people you love are going to be persecuted, how many of us are courageous? But Duncan's trials were ended there. He was an international lawyer, he could argue before the Privy Council in England. He was transferred to Bermuda where the Star Insurance Company had a big outfilt and he and Ishbel -- they had five children -- were in Bermuda. President Eisenhower was going to go to Bermuda for some sort of conference and the security people and FBI said, &quot;Oh my goodness Duncan Lee is there, a known Communist spy, how dangerous.&quot; And they brought him home and left Ishbel there with five children and he couldn't rejoin her for a whole year. There was nothing he could do about it.</p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): It's hard to believe.</em></p>
<p>LEE: There wasn't anything he could do. They were divorced. We think that after 21 years and five children but this experience was the final push.</p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): And this all reflected against your husband, didn't it.</em></p>
<p>LEE: Well, in a way yes. Duncan was so upset over Armistead and we kept saying, &quot;Look, the feeling around the country, the whole ambiance is so bad, it didn't take you to do anything.&quot; Armi spoke out, I spoke out. Look what was done to Jack Service, it all went on his record. For a certain kind of mind this was a bad thing.</p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): And Edmund Clubb and John Paton Davies -- why were those three perhaps the ones who suffered the most?</em></p>
<p>LEE: They were the ones who &quot;lost China.&quot;</p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): Yes, but there were other people who &quot;lost China&quot; too.</em></p>
<p>LEE: But John Stewart Service and John Paton Davies and Clubb and I think there was someone else... They seemed to have it in for the China hands. You know, we were almost sent to China. Armi was born there. Armi has often said, &quot;Why, I could have lost China.&quot; (both laugh) &quot;I came within an ace of losing China.&quot; (hearty laughter) I can hear him.</p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): On to Jamaica, you said you were exiled to Jamaica.</em></p>
<p>LEE: We went to Harvard for a year, which was very pleasant, and then we went to Reykjavik --Q (FENZI): And you met Adrian Cook at Harvard.</p>
<p>LEE: We asked for a European post and they said they'd love to give us a European post and it turned out to be Iceland. We had to send Norie away to school because there was no way of giving her high school iReykjavik. There was an American school some place in England but I had looked it over andidn't think it was very good, they had dreadful control over the children, just bad. So we sent Norie to Chatham Hall, where else. Then I started the school and taught third and fourth grade, but the shining light in Reykjavik was the DCM and his wife, Theodore, who is now dead, and his wife Louise who, now in her 80s, lives across the river, I see her frequently. He had been a newspaperman, and he was a rock of integrity. Nobody got away with anything with Ted, and he never once buckled under McCarthyism or anything. A wonderful person. He was the one who when he became editor of the Foreign Service Journal, kept asking me to write some things about the Foreign Service. That's how I wrote &quot;The Five.&quot; He kept saying, &quot;Why don't you write them? You've got things to say about the dreadful system the Foreign Service. Why don't you do it? I won't let anybody know it's you.&quot;</p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): But you did do them under a nom de plume.</em></p>
<p>LEE: Yes, I had to, because Armistead was still in the Service and poor Armi couldn't take anything more. He already had a file that reached to the skies, I suppose, and I knew that Ted would never reveal who I was, if they tortured him he wouldn't reveal it. He really was a wonderful man.</p>
<p>We had a good time in Reykjavik. I had thought it was sort of a dreary assignment, but you know when you go some places, begin to meet the people, understand the history ...</p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): But you don't go with any expectations, my husband always sai(she laughs) ...</em></p>
<p>LEE: You do better!</p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): Yes! You talked about having parties and people staying all night.</em></p>
<p>LEE: And there was an enormous amount of drinking. Now, the Icelanders drink in spurts. If the liquor is there, they'll drink it all up. If it's not there, they don't mind. And I gather this is apt to be true of the Finns and the Danes and the Swedes. So you got so you didn't bring out the bottl(laughing heartily) when people came. But I had enormous admiration for them, living on that windswept, treeless island. I remember going to see their national forest and the trees were this high and a sign said &quot;Please do not step on the trees.&quot; They were trying to reforest, and it's evidently very difficult once you've removed all the trees.</p>
<p>While we were there several ships went down. In the North Sea the rigging gets covered with ice and then the whole thing careens over. There was one very interesting man named Benjamin Franklin -- now his last name escapes me -- Stefansson or something like that. He was an economist, and the first time we had him for dinner I asked him, &quot;How did you happen to be named Benjamin Franklin Whatever-it-was?&quot; And he said, &quot;My brother was named Benjamin Franklin. He was on a fishing ship -- of course in those days everybody made their living fishing -- and the ship went down and all hands were lost. My mother was pregnant with me. Benjamin came to her in a dream and said he was coming back, and when I was born she knew that it was Benjamin. So I became Benjamin Franklin.&quot; Evidently there is a very strong strain, sort of like table-rappings. And if you're ever out in this lunar landscape in Iceland when the wind is moaning across the rocky fields, you can see the ghosts.</p>
<p>We saw quite a few interesting paintings when we were there. They were abstract paintings, and I've never liked abstract paintings until I lived in Iceland. It's an &quot;abstract&quot; landscape and I could see what they meant.</p>
<p>They're very literate, they had more bookshops per capita than any other country in the world. They all spoke English -- fortunately, because Iceland is a highly inflected language. Armistead studied it so he could read the economic news in the newspaper but I gather that it's just a terrible [language] -- nothing like ignorance: in college I had had Anglo-Saxon and Old English and I thought, Oh, it'll be absolutely nothing to me when I go to Iceland. Well, of course the Icelandic language is preserved in amber, it went way, way back long before Anglo-Saxon or anything I'd ever studied. Our children, to our amazement, picked it up. Jeffrey came home one day and said, &quot;You know, there's a British ship out in the harbor and it's fired on an Icelandic boat.&quot; I said, &quot;Oh Jeffy, that can't possibly be true.&quot; He said, &quot;Yes, it's true.&quot; I said, &quot;How do you know?&quot; He said, &quot;Well, this Icelandic boy told me.&quot; I said, &quot;Jeffrey, you don't speak Icelandic.&quot; And he said, &quot;No, I don't.&quot; (she laughs) But he did. That's when we learned he had begun to pick it up. Isn't it amazing how children have a special center in their brain that seems to make it possible, that locks it in.</p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): Well, they have fewer inhibitions than we do. And they have fewer words to learn.</em></p>
<p>LEE: That's right, it's a play vocabulary, and it is easier. But then of course it goes very quickly. When we went to Brussels it was gone before you could say &quot;Jack Robinson.&quot;</p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): Once they started to school and began to read, then I think the-- at least my children kept French.</em></p>
<p>LEE: Yes but you see, you don't read Icelandic. When we were there, only about 180,000 people in the whole world spoke the language. It's a lovely language to listen to. If you walk into a room hearing Icelanders talk, there's a -- you think it's English. Was it Archibald MacLeish spoke about &quot;the iron of English rings from the tongue.&quot; You get that same feeling when you hear the Icelanders talk. And it is our great-great-grandfather language. They were marvelous, rugged, strong and very democratic people. I did admire them.</p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): You've given us a wonderful backdrop against which you played out your Service years; we know exactly where you were. But what were you doing in this time? Were you teaching school and taking care of children and giving teaparties? How did you spend your time?</em></p>
<p>LEE: Well, going back to Australia and New Zealand: we were living in a neighborhood in Australia. First, in Africa, I taught some businessmen, as I put down on the bio-data form. They wanted practice in English conversation. And I gave dinner parties. There was a terrible protocol question in Dakar because practically all of the young women we knew were &quot;living&quot; as they quaintly put it &quot;in sin&quot;. I was asked by a ver(she breaks up momentarily) stiff lady at the American Consulate why I entertained young women who were openly living in sin. She herself was living in sin, but discreetly, and she thought that a distinction should be made between those who were doing it -- of course, everybody knew Dakar was like something out of &quot;The Alexandria Quartet.&quot; [Durrell tetralogy] Everybody knew what everybody else was doing.</p>
<p>So I said, &quot;Well, I'll think about it.&quot; I was the only Foreign Service wife on the coast of Africa. (both laugh heartily) So I thought about it deeply, and then I handed down my decision. I said, &quot;I don't feel I should make any distinctions.&quot; So we invited all. I felt for the young secretaries -- more of them began to arrive as we got farther away from the War. And our lovely Consul General said, &quot;I don't want anybody going down to the dock to meet these wretched women, they've got to learn what it's like here.&quot; So Armi always sneaked off with somebody else and met them, the poor souls that came in. And then I got so I invited them to my house, and then I explained about sex in Daka(laughing gain) and about how very easy it was to shack up with a nice young man, and how a lot of them were married, and a lot of it was heartbreak, and I hoped very much they would think carefully about what they did and their future there. I must say I didn't have a great deal of authorit(both laughing) but I felt I'd made an effort.</p>
<p>It was a rotten kind of decadent city. It was full of soldiers, full of gossip; it was an extraordinary experience. I remember going to the beach with Norie one time and a woman coming over and saying, &quot;Oh! I heard you'd gone to South Africa with Major Somebody-or-Other.&quot; I said, (she assumes a sprightly tone) &quot;Oh! That's interesting. I hadn't been able to find anybody to leave the baby with, whom would you suggest?&quot; You know, it was just full of rumors. And then there was one poor woman, wife of a French official, who came and begged to be invited to the parties at the Consulate. This little kind of rat-trap consulate with people barely able to get along with each other, and she felt this was the epitome of society and begged to come. It was sort of horrifying.</p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): But it was nice that we had tha[phrase obscured by cough].</em></p>
<p>LEE: Well, let's see, what did I do in Australia ... In Australia we were part of a neighborhood and there were just constant meetings. We lived in the Australian community and sort of merged to do official functions. I did have a miscarriage there, and started to have a second baby. It was very informal. I did give quite a few talks. People would ask me to talk before schools. (tape turned off during coughing spell, then resumes)</p>
<p>But there was so much emphasis on food, and on clothes, and on social position. I remember an incident in Brussels when Judy, very pregnant, came to the DCM's coffee, I brought her, and she told me she was feeling a little bit wispy and would go out and sit in the car. I was approached by the wife of the Agricultural Attaché, who said, &quot;I want to get to the trolley, would you take me there?&quot; I said I'd be delighted. So we walked out together. Arrived at my car, there was little Judy sitting in the front seat, and this woman stood there. I went around to the driver's seat, she was still standing there. It didn't dawn on me what the matter was, and finally she said, &quot;Well, I suppose don't worry about the order of your going.&quot; And it dawned on me: she thought she shoud be in the front seat. So I said, &quot;No, just get in the back seat and go.&quot; And I took her down.</p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): There were people who did that. Like going to the ladies' room. I remember being sent in ahead because I was pregnant, otherwise you went in according to the rank of your husband.</em></p>
<p>LEE: I do have one funny passage in belling the cat where I tell about Wahwee at a party sitting down in the center of the sofa that will hold five and the ladies peeling off according to their rank.</p>
<p>In Australia I enjoyed myself very much. I did give some talks. Once somebody asked me one time to give a talk on &quot;America the Melting Pot,&quot; so I graciously consented. Armistead reported it to the Consul General, who said, &quot;I don't think that's a very good subject, she might get into difficulties with that. I don't want her to talk on America.&quot; So I had to tell these people that I couldn't talk on America the melting pot. &quot;Well,&quot; they said, &quot;what could you talk on?&quot; And I said, &quot;How about Robert Frost?&quot; So I talked about Robert Frost the New England poet.</p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): I know that in Brussels you graded the exams of the English-speaking children at the Common Market school?</em></p>
<p>LEE: No. I tutored American kids who were going to take the SATs. There was one fellow, living as nephew with his aunt and uncle, who was going to take the SATs and had hardly ever written a composition in his life. So he came to me, and I said, &quot;Let's pretend that this is the subject: How has the hero in literature changed? Try not to think in more than three paragraphs, and do this and this and this.... &quot; This is the subject he got on his exam: &quot;The Hero in English Literature.&quot; (she breaks up) And I got a book, he gave me Bartlett's Quotations with a little inscription on it. He got into the college on my psyching.</p>
<p>What else? I served on the school board with Hope, and we were really rather embattled on that school board, we spent a lot of time on it. Then I belonged to the Canadian Women's Club, where you had to produce a scholarly paper. So I produced a scholarly paper. There was a lot of entertaining. And I can remember it was pretty tense because so often somebody didn't come in on time on a plane. And I remember the first dinner party I gave. Of course Angela was there, and I had a caterer. One of the Belgian guests came in, and when he sat down at table he tucked his napkin right into his cravat, and you realized he lived for his food. So I just watched breathlessly. When the grand marnier soufflé came in, he burst into applause, (she claps her hands) he congratulated the cook and Angela, and they tipped everybody. Which seemed to me a very strange thing to do; and I realized that food meant a very great deal to Belgians. I was very careful. I didn't have a caterer after that, I did it myself, but Angela was a great help, she really was an angel.</p>
<p><em>Q (SQUIRE): And remember when you used to come with your washing when your machine broke down?</em></p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): And lowered the tone of your building.</em></p>
<p>LEE: We had a very nice couple named Julé, [phonetic] who lived just above us. Our conversation was confined to &quot;Bonjours! Bon soir!&quot; One day, after we'd been told we were leaving, Mme. Julé said to us, &quot;Mme. Lee, I understand you're leaving us.&quot; And I said, &quot;Yes, alas, we are.&quot; And she said, &quot;Oh, what a shame, you are so simpathèque!&quot; That was warmth from a Belgian.</p>
<p>Then we were asked by the Pouterman[phonetic], who went to Brittany for a holiday, I think they had a little house there. And we, to our surprise, got a postcard from them asking why didn't we come and they could put up some of the children and there was a nearby hotel. Armi showed this at the Embassy, and everybody said &quot;GO!&quot; So the Poutermans took Rebecca and Norie, and we had Jeffrey in the hotel, and we had a lovely time. The Poutermans were warm, and when we left Mme. Pouterman said, &quot;Your girls, zay could stay wiz me forever.&quot; [they could stay with me forever]</p>
<p><em>Q (SQUIRE): They were Flemish, which made a difference.</em></p>
<p>LEE: Yes, it did. He did translations into Flemish of Robert Frost's poetry. He said it translated very easily into Flemish. I never saw his translations, it wouldn't have meant anything to me if I had.</p>
<p>That's pretty much what I did. I had to be home with the children quite a lot. And it rained a great deal. We had a Monopoly game going in the living room ...</p>
<p><em>Q (SQUIRE): With my child, whenever it was raining.</em></p>
<p>LEE: It was back and forth. We were very sedulous about that. So I think we were pretty well occupied.</p>
<p><em>Q (SQUIRE): French lessons.</em></p>
<p>LEE: Oh yes, I went to the Embassy every morning and got oiled up in French. In New Zealand, I did give some lectures for the Workers Educational Association, which was wonderful, a very active outfit. They asked me if I'd be willing to give lectures on American poets. So I gave it twice. I think there was a series of six lectures that I wrote and gave. Then I was asked by some little town outside Wellington to repeat it and gave it a second time. Then the radio station called and asked me -- Edgar Allan Poe's birthday was coming up, and would I talk a little bit about Poe, and would I read 'Bells'?&quot; I said I'd be delighted to talk about Poe but I really couldn't read &quot;Bells.&quot; I couldn't see myself saying &quot;Bells, bells, bells...&quot; So I asked them if &quot;The Raven&quot; wouldn't do just as well? They decided it would.</p>
<p>Then I did an Emily Dickinson lecture. She has always been a special friend of mine, and the Emily Dickinson one was the most successful. I was told after I left that they rebroadcast it several times.</p>
<p><em>Q (SQUIRE): You are such a perfect example of someone who could have had a successful career in the Foreign Service, you could have carried your career with you.</em></p>
<p>LEE: I don't know. Because in most of these countries they have rules about employing aliens.</p>
<p><em>Q (SQUIRE): Not now. We have that ...</em></p>
<p>LEE: I know it's reciprocal but how does it work? I understand it doesn't work too well.</p>
<p><em>Q (SQUIRE): But we have international schools, and now we teach people to teach English as a second language. But you already were doing this, way back.</em></p>
<p>LEE: Well, I think the situation is entirely different for wives now. From what I've heard, some complaints about wives in the Foreign Service as it is today, some of them don't enter into the life as much as they should. I hope this isn't true because I think you get a lot out of it if you -- I did resent going to these fiendish coffees at Wahwee MacArthur's that you had to go. It was silly. And when she said, you remember, &quot;Where is little Mrs. So-and-So?&quot; And the DCM's wife said, &quot;Well, she has a baby and the baby's ill,&quot; and she said, (mimicking haughty voice) &quot;I don't consider that an adequate excuse.&quot; You know, the utter impertinence and rudeness of these people is [unbelievable].</p>
<p><em>Q (SQUIRE): And you knew you had to go, so you had to have sitters lined up so you could go no matter what.</em></p>
<p>LEE: So I'm glad that system has changed.</p>
<p><em>Q (SQUIRE): But you would have been an English teacher, I mean you are an English teacher and were one but you'd have been able to carry it around, I think.</em></p>
<p>LEE: Possibly so. I enjoyed the tutoring. And of course with children -- I suppose you could carry, everybody carries on a career with children now. And we had help in the home. But I did enough so that I can't say my life in the Foreign Service was one of frustration. In spite of some of the horrible Officers we had, I enjoyed it, I made so many good friends, I enjoyed the countries where we lived.</p>
<p><em>Q (SQUIRE): You've just said something then. You suppose you could have carried on a career with children. We never thought about it.</em></p>
<p>LEE: We never thought of it, we were brought up that way.</p>
<p><em>Q (SQUIRE): It was something that might happen later.</em></p>
<p>LEE: But now, they have to do it. And they want to do it, I think many of them want to do it. I have a feeling that there are some who do not, and I hope that they won't have to if they don't want to. I found, suddenly with my first child, I don't know whether it happened to every American woman, but suddenly I had two university degrees and I was spending my tim(she laughs heartily) in conversation with a two-year-old. You know, you do require a little lift during these periods.</p>
<p><em>Q (SQUIRE): At least we had that -- our husbands were in a profession where people were interesting, the conversation that went around us in the evening was interesting.</em></p>
<p>LEE: And you felt the work they were dong was worthwhile. And a lot of time the things you were doing were worthwhile, it wasn't just putting canapés on a plate.</p>
<p><em>Q (SQUIRE): Well, Brussels was growing so, the American community was growing when we were there, also. So we were busy all the time.</em></p>
<p>LEE: And fortunately we weren't always exposed to the MacArthurs. I can remember when my mother came out, she was so horrified. She felt just the way I did when I first entered the Foreign Service. &quot;This isn't American! I'm going to tell George.&quot; &quot;George&quot; was George Aiken who was in the Senate. She told George but he couldn't do anything about it. (she laughs heartily) It is inexcusable that a Foreign Service chief should behave so badly to his underlings. There's no excuse for it.</p>
<p><em>Q (SQUIRE): And the wives may have been worse.</em></p>
<p>LEE: Oh I think some of them were absolute fiends. (she laughs)</p>
<p><em>Q (SQUIRE): Do you suppose they still are?</em></p>
<p>LEE: Well, I don't believe they can be.</p>
<p><em>Q (SQUIRE): They can't force people to do things.</em></p>
<p>LEE: I think that's been erased, don't you suppose? Now, I suppose there's still a great deal of tension about the promotion list, and women are insisting that they haven't been treated right, and the blacks, I suppose, are saying they're not represented enough; and there are all kinds of tensions and disputes. But the wives must be completely apart from this now, I can't see how it would impinge on them in any way. They can have their own careers and they can earn their own money and they don't have to show up at functions.</p>
<p><em>Q (SQUIRE): They can entertain if they want to.</em></p>
<p>LEE: Or not. So, in a way I would think this was progress, wouldn't you?</p>
<p><em>Q (SQUIRE): Oh yes. I think that they're missing some of the things that we had.</em></p>
<p>LEE: I do too. Particularly if they don't understand that there's a certain amount of pleasure to be gained from [the experience][End of side B, tape I; Begin side A, tape II]</p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): Dorothy Stansbury, who was then head of OBC, got together 27 women to put out guidelines. Now, mind you, this was 1971, Dorothy Stansbury was a feminist-activist, the president of the Women's Action Organization. They made her the head of Wives Training, which she named Spouse Training because we began getting male spouses in. She convened these 27 women to do these guidelines which were out of the Middle Ages for the times. I knew Carol Pardon'[phonetic] article was in there because I had copied it, but I didn't realize yours was there. So you were here in Washington at the time?</em></p>
<p>LEE: I was here in Washington and Armistead had just retired from the Foreign Service. So I came out from under my shield and I was very polite about the guidelines. I said I approached guidelines for Foreign Service wives at posts abroad with &quot;lively interest&quot;. It is a commendable attempt at improvement in an area which needs improvement. Unlike its many predecessors, pronouncements handed down from Sinai raising hackles all the way from Delhi to Dakar, this one takes a pleasant, intelligent and encouraging tone. It's conciliatory, it is reasonable, it is hortatory, and I am afraid it often will not work.&quot;</p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): And it didn't.</em></p>
<p>LEE: It didn't, no. And then I proceed to tell why I think it won't work.</p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): And it didn't. And I don't know any of those people. I do recognize a couple of names. I recognize George Lambrakis, and Gerald Lamberty, and Irving Cheslaw, those are the only names I recognize. Do you know any of those people?</em></p>
<p>LEE: I'd been away for a long time at that time.</p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): But you see, in part of the talk I give at FSI I say that those guidelines just absolutely blew the roof as far as the young wives are concerned. And that's exactly what happened. And you having been through it for how many years?</em></p>
<p>LEE: For practically 25 years.</p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): And just out of the Service, could see that they weren't going to work, too.</em></p>
<p>LEE: At the end of my article I suggest an ombudsman. I realized that the picture the Foreign Service has of itself would preclude a labor union. (she laughs) But I would suggest an ombudsman, somebody who would be outside to whom one could refer injustices and problems that come up.</p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): In a way, FLO has done that. Not entirely but FLO has become the ombudsman for families and spouses.</em></p>
<p>LEE: But Pat was talking about the wife of the Ambassador in USSR, saying that she really frightens Foreign Service wives today.</p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): She seems like a rather formidable person.</em></p>
<p>LEE: She is. But I should think that just because the thing has changed, it must be better than it was under Wahwee.</p>
<p><em>Q (SQUIRE): Wahwee could make you come and do the flowers.</em></p>
<p>LEE: She almost sent -- who was the girl who worked in the Economic section with Armi in Brussels? Mary Carmichael ... I had, fortunately, arthritis when I was there with Wahwee and I used it to the hilt. And Mary came up to me one day savagely. &quot;I know what you're doing. You're going to the parties you want to go to and staying home when you don't want to go.&quot; And I said, &quot;Mary, mind your own business.&quot; (all laugh)</p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): We won't name names but in what capacity does the woman in Moscow operate? She has no control, so what does she do? Maybe she should be told what she's doing.</em></p>
<p>LEE: I suppose she can say to her husband, &quot;That family is murder and don't you promote Foreign Service X.&quot;</p>
<p><em>Q (SQUIRE): Oh no, I don't think she'd do that.</em></p>
<p>LEE: I don't know.</p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): But how is she frightening them?</em></p>
<p>LEE: I don't see how she could frighten them.</p>
<p><em>Q (SQUIRE): Well, I don't know whether she frightens them but she gets ...</em></p>
<p>LEE: She just ...</p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): Well, it must be hard when you've paid your dues and be somewhat in your own mind living by the old rules and yet not being able to put them into ...</em></p>
<p><em>Q (SQUIRE): Oh, I think there were a lot of people who suddenly felt &quot;wow, I've made it, my husband is now a senior Officer and I can't do anything, it's all been taken away from me.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): Part of it could be, also, that women didn't relaize -- could it have been that they didn't realize what their responsibilities were going to be as a senior Officer's wife?</em></p>
<p>LEE: I do think that sometimes the senior Officer's wife felt burdened and tense and probably became more savage than she otherwise -- and I felt about Wahwee MacArthur, as I studied her, she had I think great native intelligence, and I think if she had gone into some career on her own ... And of course being married to him was hard times. He was a dreadful little man.</p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): She may have been subject to pressures from him, which she was then passing on to others? She probably didn't like what she was doing.</em></p>
<p>LEE: She got to be an alcoholic.</p>
<p><em>Q (SQUIRE): Drank only champagne. She was interesting when the Interplanetary Union came to Brussels. Speaking really as the daughter of the Vice President, she lectured us and was very good at that, and said, &quot;Don't you spend any money for them, they just will forget all about it.&quot; And I remember buying a dozen handkerchiefs for Senator Alcott from Colorado, at the very end thinking, &quot;Oh well, I can afford a dozen handkerchiefs.&quot; He not only paid me back, he sent me a lovely little handkerchief that he'd bought in his hotel, along with his card. She was good.</em></p>
<p>LEE: I think she just wasn't using her abilities. When I saw her on the Lorenzo Mark crossing to Portugal, she was a siren. She wore black, and all I can remember is black cut low. I remember writing to Armi, &quot;Retired spy she looks like.&quot; But she was very personable, none of this law-and-orders business. I had nice conversations with Wahwee and she was okay. But somehow getting to be a senior Officer's wife was more than she could handle.</p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): Both you and Caroline speak so fondly of Lisa Greene, and yet other people don't speak fondly of her.</em></p>
<p>LEE: She was hell on wheels in the Foreign Service but she helped nurse me when I was in the hospital and I almost fell over when Lisa walked in, an angel of mercy. Just absolutely charming and sweet. The Foreign Service wasn't good for Lisa.</p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): Caroline is the one person that I've heard say something nice about Mrs. Loy Henderson. She just wasn't interested in what her husband was doing, she didn't like her role, and she probably was a woman before her time. She'd just leave and go up to Kashmir or somewhere, anyway she'd leave New Delhi, she didn't like it, it was hot. She may have been a woman way before her time.</em></p>
<p><em>Q (SQUIRE): So what good were we? Look what he did without ...</em></p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): Well, I've always maintained that what we do has absolutely no bearing on our husband's career at all. (she laughs)</em></p>
<p>LEE: I think so too. I think you had to be a perfectly ghastly wife doing unmentionable things to have made the slightest ...</p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): I don't think even that made any difference! (laughter)</em></p>
<p><em>Q (SQUIRE): We worked hard ...LEE: We worked hard, we entertained Inspectors. I remember when we were in New Zealand an Inspector broke his leg on the airplane. Something happened and he was bounced, so he came to dinner in a cast. We were all very tender with him and took care of him.</em></p>
<p><em>Q (SQUIRE): Oh, those days of planning for every single minute.</em></p>
<p>LEE: And you had children, and in New Zealand you didn't have any help half the time. We didn't have central heating there, it gets so cold; it didn't snow but it sleeted. We had a fireplace and I was just feeding the fireplace all day.</p>
<p>But you know, to go back to the Ambassador's wife in New Zealand, this sort of exotic flower who came and began to adjust to New Zealand and enjoy it. After we left, one of the wives lost a baby, and this woman just came in day after day and held her hand, just darling to her. And you wouldn't have dreamed it was possible when she arrived.</p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): I think a lot of these women are just out of their elements, they just don't know how to act. I really believe that.</em></p>
<p><em>Q (SQUIRE): Which is interesting when they've gone up through the Service. I mean, some of the real ogres by reputation are women who went right up from being a Vice Consuls' wife.</em></p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): Well, &quot;power corrupts.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>Q (SQUIRE): &quot;And absolute power corrupts absolutely.&quot; (all laugh)</em></p>
<p>LEE: It was wonderful to see somebody who was at the to of the heap who was pleasant and relaxed and charming and sweet and untense.</p>
<p><em>Q (SQUIRE): Oh, I can remember that awful time at the end of [our Brussels] tour when somebody came in the airport and Ambassador MacArthur had a speech which was written for him and he stood up and delivered it. Then some American General gave a speech, and it was two minutes longer than our Ambassador's. And he had a temper tantrum. &quot;By God, I'm of the deck here&quot; -- back at the ranch -- &quot;nobody, but nobody is to speak longer than I do.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>Q (FENZI): And so, she picked up on that.</em></p>
<p>LEE: She was Alben Barkley's daughter and he was so witty and charming and laid back. I gather that her sister was a very nice girl, and I asked somebody who knew those girls when they were little if Wahwee was [bossy] and they couldn't see that she was. I think shmust have been the small sister because in the family Wahwee was a baby name for her. I don't know her real name.</p>
<p><em>Q (SQUIRE): Maybe her sister called her that.</em></p>
<p>LEE: Well, are we through?Q (FENZI): Yes, we are, for now.</p>

<p>IBM's victory at Jeopardy has led to the usual woe-is-humans handwringing, including (charmingly) <a class="reference external" href="http://www.slate.com/id/2284721/pagenum/all/">from Jennings himself</a>.</p>
<p>But look, while I agree that the logic of machines crowding out off-the-shelf humans is compelling, I think there's some reason for hope. &nbsp;I, and probably most of you, already carry a substantial <a class="reference external" href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/">neural prosthesis</a> around with me all the time, which confers superhuman trivia capabilities at a level even more impressive than the Watson system. &nbsp;It's just that a couple of the system buses are a bit slow. &nbsp;The neural bus will remain relatively sluggish, but for now it's the interface that's the real problem.</p>
<p>I think there's a lot of low-hanging fruit that can be grabbed on this front: voluntary cochlear implants, haptic interfaces, mobile or ubiquitous ambient displays -- but at some point we'll be talking about neural interfaces, and the problem's going to require technology that's currently only speculative. &nbsp;That's going to be a difficult problem to solve. &nbsp;More difficult than creating artificially intelligent beings? &nbsp;Honestly, I don't think we know enough to guess. &nbsp;But I suspect the answer could go a long way toward determining whether or not our descendants spend their days fighting Terminators.</p>
<p><strong>Let me add:</strong> it occurs to me that one interesting/tragic side-effect of the steadily improving quality of these interfaces is likely to be the disenfranchisement of older workers who are biologically incapable of utilizing these self-enhancing tools. &nbsp;I don't just mean in an &quot;old people can't work the VCR&quot; way (though I think that may be related); I mean that neuroplasticity declines with age, and it's conceivable that some of these technologies will simply be impossible to install in people with less malleable nervous systems. &nbsp;My understanding is that there's already some reason to think this phenomenon affects users of cochlear implants (though I'd want to do a bit more reading about it to be sure).</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>Over at Grist Tom Philpott has written a few posts about the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.grist.org/article/2011-02-10-still-drinking-diet-soda-dont-be-a-fashion-victim-pepsi-strokes">dangers</a> of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.grist.org/article/2011-02-14-just-how-bad-is-aspartame-the-leading-u.s.-fake-sweetener">diet</a> <a class="reference external" href="http://www.grist.org/article/2011-02-16-aspartame-soda-caramel-BPA-diet-soda-kill-you">soda</a>, and I've been acting cranky about them on Twitter. To be honest, it's not that the posts are that bad, or even that I disagree with their gist. I tend to think that soda isn't very good for me in general, and I avoid artificial sweeteners because (in order of decreasing importance to me) I don't like the taste, have mostly weaned myself off sweeteners, and put at least some stock in the health case against them. So I haven't really got a dog in this fight, other than general reactionary impulses. I am also not anxious to get into a big huge debate with Tom, because frankly he knows much more about food science than I do. Besides, he seems like a nice guy.</p>
<p>Still, these posts got my goat. I think it's because they're emblematic of a number of rhetorical tics that people use when trying to write scary stories about chemicals. And I hate that shit. The audience for that kind of thing is useless at picking or prioritizing their battles; I tend to think it leads to more anxiety, fewer vaccinated kids, and absolutely no effect on policy or health outcomes (other than those related to communicable disease, of course).</p>
<p>Also, I'm confident that Tom's a smart guy, so the posts struck me as deliberately engineered linkbait, which I also dislike.</p>
<p>Anyway, the Twitter can of worms has been opened, so let me explain here what bugged me about these posts and made me feel that they were representative of bad online coverage of environmental toxins in general.</p>
<p><strong>Cherry-picking research</strong></p>
<p>This one's easy. Confirmation bias is real (look around and you'll see it everywhere, the joke goes). I particularly winced when I read the phrase &quot;Italian researchers&quot;. Admittedly, I don't know the state of Italian biomedical research. But I do follow some alternative energy stuff, and I can tell you with confidence that that country produces more cold fusion &quot;breakthroughs&quot; per capita than anywhere else on earth. Plus, <a class="reference external" href="http://crookedtimber.org/2010/03/23/why-does-italian-academia-suck/">people smarter than me seem to think the Italian academy is a joke</a>. But hey, if the abstract says what we want it to say...</p>
<p>Succumbing to this temptation is understandable, and I've certainly been guilty of it myself. &nbsp;You need to be shut up in a doctoral program for a very long time to begin to possess any kind of immunity. &nbsp;Frankly, I doubt that any of us are equipped to truly resist it. &nbsp;But it's still irritating to be on the other side of it.</p>
<p><strong>Nomenclature as indictment</strong></p>
<p>Particularly infuriating. Lots of chemicals sound scary, and health writers never resist the opportunity to deploy a 5,4-methylpropylbenzepene or whatever into a laboriously recited ingredient list. But it's meaningless. The nomenclature got a lot scarier when chemists changed how they name compounds. There were good reasons for doing this (reasons that open data evangelists would find particularly appealing!), but the change does seem to have some unfortunately profound side effects on the human mind.</p>
<p>Similarly, pointing to constituent elements or the chemical class to which a compound belongs is rarely illuminating. At one point in the third post Tom discusses how caramel coloring is made by denaturing starches with heat and &quot;ammonia-based&quot; compounds. A shout-out to something you keep under your sink next to the drain cleaner can't help but cause alarm. But of course fertilizer is also &quot;ammonia-based&quot;; and nobody seems to worry much when it gets turned into protein and eaten. &nbsp;If you are <a class="reference external" href="http://pipeline.corante.com">Derek Lowe</a> or someone like him, you can start to develop rules of thumb about the biological effects of compounds based on their structure. &nbsp;If you aren't, you can't and shouldn't.</p>
<p>Tom would probably object to this characterization, as his account goes on to discuss a byproduct of the denaturing process that's carcinogenic. I'd say that that falls under &quot;cherry-picking research&quot;. In truth, lots of cooking processes produce carcinogenic compounds (the process he describes is not dissimilar to how pretzels are made). Remember the scare over acrylamides in french fries and other oil-cooked carbohydrates from a few years back (or the one over the char on your steak)? Suddenly it became apparent that we were all consuming boatloads of cancer-causing chemicals! &nbsp;But it turned out that the situation's more complex than that, and a study suggesting that one component of a food has shown carcinogenic effects (often only in an animal model) isn't nearly enough evidence to justify a freakout over the food in general.</p>
<p>As another example, consider coffee, a beverage that Tom points to approvingly at the end of the second post. The roasting process produces a huge array of chemicals, not nearly all of which have been characterized and studied, and many of which have demonstrated carcinogenic effects (<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee">here's a Wikipedia link</a>, though like me you've probably already heard this elsewhere). But that doesn't matter, because coffee is categorized under our semi-arbitrary &quot;good/natural&quot; heuristic, albeit perhaps with various qualifying words attached to it in our laughable mental medical tag cloud (parkinsons/osteoporosis/miscarriage/anemia/whatever).</p>
<p><strong>Ignoring scale</strong></p>
<p>Less relevant to this series of posts, admittedly, but a habitual mistake of this kind of writing. Humans are awful at understanding differences of even several orders of magnitude, and authors are even worse at bothering to convey them. &nbsp;For our purposes, this is a problem on two fronts: both chemical concentrations and the scale of measured health effects. All you have to do is say &quot;there's uranium in your drinking water!&quot; and people will start going nuts. You know what? There almost certainly <em>is</em> uranium in my drinking water, and yours too. There's nasty stuff everywhere; you can't avoid it. Things diffuse! Hell, cosmic rays transmute atoms! But until you quantify the scale and demonstrate the effect, these facts are meaningless. Bad things will get into your body, but usually in very small amounts, and your liver and kidneys will probably have no problem doing their usual kickass job of dealing with them (if the bad thing bioaccumulates, you should admittedly be less sanguine about this; but that's not applicable to the compounds under discussion).</p>
<p>But this is not how the human mind works. You only have to invoke a substance and a sort of animistic power takes over. It's homeopathy at an angle. It's why we have airport security theater. Numbers mean so very little to our idiot monkey brains.</p>
<p><strong>Pretending epidemiology hasn't been invented</strong></p>
<p>Perhaps I will be accused of a kind of libertarian placidity for this one. That would probably be fair. Still, I think that writers often lead with &quot;we are all unwitting participants in a huge and unethical natural experiment!&quot; and then decline to ask whether any data's come in from this bit of mad science. And the fact is that it has. &quot;It's a mixed bag&quot; is the answer that then invariably follows, but that's sort of telling in itself, right? People have been consuming aspartame for a while now -- some of them even doing so while participating in vast longitudinal studies -- and it's just not the case that it makes you start sprouting tumors or hemorrhaging spinal fluid or growing hermaphroditic genitalia. I'm all for getting BPA out of the lining of tins of baby food, but it's pretty hard to make the case that any of the worrying maybes in Tom's posts are actually manifesting themselves as health crises. Yes, someone needs to be manning the watchtower; yes, industry has incentives for bad behavior. But in this particular case I think the decades' worth of rhetorical and scientific stalemate over sweeteners is enough to merit some shrugging and eye-rolling.</p>
<p>Diet sodas are not a serious health problem. They're just not. It may be that avoiding them is a good idea at the margin -- and like I said, I do exactly that, because hell, I don't enjoy 'em anyway. But it's hard for me to take myself very seriously as I do so. Sure, I don't like the idea of methanol in my body, but I dislike it in almost exactly the same way that Scientologists don't like the idea of thetans in theirs. It's just a neurotic tic; an echo of a sort of Jungian archetype about impurity; really, a hobby at best. I mean, I still drink alcohol, and exercise less than I should, and go out in the sun a lot when I'm on vacation. Despite this disregard for my health I am still probably among the healthiest people in history, thanks to having enough money and living in America in the era that I do.</p>
<p>But look, perhaps you are healthier still. That is definitely possible! If so, by all means, freak out about aspartame if you want. It just strikes me as unlikely to deliver a very good return on the worry you intend to invest in it.</p>

                    <p>Like <a class="reference external" href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/ezra-klein/2011/02/that_is_what_it_does.html">Ezra</a>, I find <a class="reference external" href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2011/01/dropbox-on-quora.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+BradDelongsSemi-dailyJournal+(Brad+DeLong's+Semi-Daily+Journal)">this explanation</a> for Dropbox's success intellectually attractive. &nbsp;Minimalism! &nbsp;Of course! &nbsp;It's so simple! &nbsp;It's exactly the kind of thing that software developers get off on. For one thing, it legitimizes our lust for Apple products -- despite the fact that Apple UI betrays the idea more often than we admit -- because most of us can't or don't want to distinguish between <em>good aesthetics</em> and <em>simplicity</em>. &nbsp;It's sort of zen. &nbsp;It makes us feel wise. &nbsp;But in this case I don't buy it.</p>
<p>Here's what I think happened. &nbsp;Amazon launched its <a class="reference external" href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/">S3 service</a>. &nbsp;Suddenly you could buy Big Storage services at essentially marginal cost, immediately. &nbsp;No physical capital expenses, and human capital expenses were dramatically reduced (now you need a programmer who can work with AWS, but not someone who can source, install and manage huge RAID arrays in a datacenter somewhere).</p>
<p>That happened, and then a bunch of people tried to resell this service with some paper-thin rebranding/UI work. &nbsp;Kevin Rose and Leah Culver with Pownce, and some Flickr clone with too many O's in its name, and whatever, a bunch of people. &nbsp;Dropbox was the first -- as far as I know -- to come up with a funded business model that could provide a useful amount of synced storage for free.</p>
<p>Also -- and this is something that the Quora answer completely underplays -- &nbsp;Dropbox is quite technically sophisticated. &nbsp;It's not just rsync on a minute cron, you know. &nbsp;It's hooking into filesystem interrupts to notice when stuff changes in the synced folder, and doing it natively on every major OS. &nbsp;It's got quiet but powerful ways of dealing with versioning conflicts. &nbsp;It's also doing all of this with a high degree of polish (I mean: Growl notifications, c'mon). &nbsp;Plus it's smart enough to do things like notice when it needs to sync within a LAN instead of over the net, avoiding complexities you might not have considered like NAT traversal. &nbsp;It's not that it's so simple; it's actually a very sophisticated execution. &nbsp;It's just that those parts aren't necessarily visible (and no, many of its competitors were not as clever).</p>
<p>Now, this is minimalism, in a sense. &nbsp;But it's not the sort of minimalism pointed to in the Quora answer, which amounts to &quot;Let's offer fewer features than those other jerks and we'll all get rich!&quot; &nbsp;It's more about doing things that are sophisticated and difficult, and not wasting time on UI afterthoughts.</p>
<p>It was 2006 when S3 launched, but a few years isn't THAT long for a specialized market to shake out. &nbsp;Besides, S3 prices have been falling since its launch, so it could've either been a lack of investment in the synced-storage space or just the need to wait for a cheaper equilibrium point that delayed the rise of a winner in the space. &nbsp;At some point a critical mass was reached and brand recognition took over.</p>
<p>Anyway, Amazon's contribution to web infrastructure is the key here. &nbsp;Its transformative field-leveling effect on the industry (and the web's increasing reliance on it) is a story that ought to be explored more in the popular press. &nbsp;AWS deserves a bit more of the concern that Google commonly attracts for its market power.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>About three weeks ago I finally received my <a class="reference external" href="http://wakemate.com">Wakemate</a>. A part of the burgeoning <a class="reference external" href="http://quantifiedself.com/about/">quantified self movement</a> and yet another example of a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.apple.com/ipod/nike/">product</a> <a class="reference external" href="http://wii.com">made</a> <a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtcys_XFnRA">possible</a> by the last half-decade's debut of cheap silicon accelerometers, it's exactly the kind of thing you'd expect me to buy.</p>
<p>Wakemate is built on three ideas borrowed from sleep research. First: we experience a recurring cycle of sleep states during a night's rest. Pretty much everyone's aware of this, if only because it was part of an <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_Terrors_(Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation)">episode</a> of <a class="reference external" href="http://sadstartrek.com">Star Trek</a>. Over the course of a night you spend progressively less time in a deep sleep state, and more in light states where dreaming occurs.</p>
<p><img alt="image1" class="center" src="/skitch/sleep_cycle-20110122-115450.png" /></p>
<p>Second: these sleep states are measurable using a technique called actigraphy. As <a class="reference external" href="http://wakemate.com/media/docs/actigraphy.pdf?0404a5">this paper</a> explains, during sleep the motion of your non-dominant wrist seems to correlate pretty well with <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polysomnography">more precise measures of sleep state</a>. You can get a decent measurement of sleep state just by tracking what your left hand is up to.</p>
<p>Third: your level of grogginess upon waking varies depending on which part of your sleep cycle you're in when your alarm goes off. This is known as sleep inertia, and the WM's creators have a few paper excerpts about it <a class="reference external" href="http://wakemate.com/media/docs/waking.pdf?0404a5">here</a>.</p>
<p>The Wakemate folks took these three ideas and combined them -- in a way sure to elicit much (potentially justified) tongue-clucking from sleep researchers -- into a product. Put on a wristband, load a program on your phone, and set a twenty-minute window during which you'd like to wake up. The device keeps watch during that time period for moments when you seem to be in a light sleep state, doing its best to find one and rouse you in a way that minimizes grogginess (if it doesn't find one, it'll wake you up at the end of the time window). The idea's so clever that I barely care whether it works.</p>
<div class="section" id="snakebit">
<h2>Snakebit</h2>
<p>I first heard about all of this from my colleague Kevin back in February of last year. It sounded like an interesting idea, and for just $5 you could reserve your place in line for the device (it ultimately cost me $50; it's now selling for $60). Wakemate is a Y Combinator startup, and its founders went through a semi-hilarious series of problems as they tried to ship their first product. Bad wristbands. Delayed electronics. Problems with Apple certification. The thing finally arrived, months late; the next day I got an email warning me that the included power adapter might burn my house down. And for the first week or so, the app only woke me up at the end of the 20-minute window -- at the fail-safe point -- seemingly because it wasn't able to communicate with the wristband (I had to reboot the latter unit multiple times to get the night's data downloaded). With the exception of the charger (any USB adapter will do), all of these problems have been fixed. But it was a bumpy ride. Kevin still hasn't received his.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="surprisingly-plausible">
<h2>Surprisingly Plausible</h2>
<p>Here's the source data from last Thursday's sleep, and Wakemate's classification of that data into sleep states.</p>
<p><img alt="image2" class="center" src="/skitch/wakemate_sample_night-20110122-120802.png" /></p>
<p><img alt="image3" class="center" src="/skitch/wakemate_source_data-20110122-120912.png" /></p>
<p>This seems kind of reasonable! Check out the huge spike at the beginning of the accelerometer time series. That's when I was still awake and reading. Over the course of the night I went through about four cycles, spending less time in deep sleep each iteration. You can see four clusters of movement data, too. This isn't the cleanest night's worth of data -- I didn't feel like clicking through all of them to find the tidiest -- but as I've looked at these over the past few weeks, I haven't yet seen any patterns that seemed implausible either in terms of the reported sleep cycle pattern or its correlation to the underlying movement data.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="does-it-work">
<h2>Does It Work?</h2>
<p>At first I was a bit disappointed: the central gimmick of the WM didn't seem to be working. If anything, I seemed to be groggier than usual when I woke up. But as I already mentioned, I eventually realized that the alarm was only going off at the end of the twenty minute window. I emailed WM's extremely responsive support line and was told that the issue had already been fixed in software and was just waiting on Apple certification. Happily enough, I was able to download the update by that evening. And although the days since have seen a suspicious number of wakings during the first minute of the alarm period, I'm actually surprised to report that it <em>might</em> be working. I'm still plenty groggy during the minute or two when I futz with the alarm (and report my level of alertness using the software slider). But I'll be damned if I don't seem to snap out of it sooner than usual.</p>
<p>On the other hand, this may not have anything to do with the timing of the alarm: it might just be that I'm getting more sleep. Which brings me to the best thing about Wakemate.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="data-porn">
<h2>Data Porn</h2>
<p>I was most excited for the alarm functionality, but the analytics package that WM provides has proven to be its most compelling feature. Your nightly sleep data is uploaded each morning and placed into an attractive interface. You can easily find information about time spent asleep, how long it took you to fall asleep, and how many times you woke up in the night. It'll also show you how your recent performance in these areas compares to your career average, and to that of the entire population of WM users.</p>
<p><img alt="image4" class="center" src="/skitch/wakemate_sleep_stats-20110122-123655.png" /></p>
<p>You can also tag each night's sleep when you set the alarm -- did you read before bed? go to the gym? drink alcohol? -- and perform comparisons between tags.</p>
<p>Perhaps less helpfully, WM provides a &quot;Sleep Score&quot;. I can't find any detailed information about how this is calculated -- I suspect that this opacity is intentional, both to allow the formula to be tweaked and to keep users from trying to game it. And while it's sort of amusing to have competitive sleeping leaderboards (<em>how does Justin Sweetman sleep so virtuosically?</em>), the scores seem to me to be basically bullshit. I tend to score highest when I've gone to bed late and with alcohol in my system; as you might guess, my scores don't correlate very well with how rested I feel. You seem to be penalized for &quot;low quality&quot; sleep, even if it means more sleep -- in other words, collapsing from exhaustion and sleeping like a corpse for three hours might earn you a higher sleep score than getting a normal night's rest.</p>
<p>Since I'm on a bit of an Excel kick, here's a plot of my sleep scores versus minutes asleep (WM recently added the ability to download your data as a CSV, which is nice of them).</p>
<p><img alt="image5" class="center" src="/skitch/wakemate_sleep_score-20110122-124141.png" /></p>
<p>Admittedly, I don't yet really have enough data for that trend line to be meaningful. But I have my suspicions.</p>
<p>Still, I've actually found the product to be worthwhile, not just as an interesting exercise in navel-gazing. For instance, it turns out there's a reason my Sundays aren't very productive:</p>
<p><img alt="image6" class="center" src="/skitch/wakemate_time_per_night-20110122-124521.png" /></p>
<p>I honestly had no idea I was getting so little rest on weekends.</p>
<p>In general, I'd say that it's been surprising and useful to have the amount of time I spend asleep quantified. I've always needed a relatively large amount of rest in order to function. I have nothing but admiration (and jealousy) for those of you who get five hours a night, hop out of bed, write a thousand words and run a half marathon. But I just can't do it. At the absolute depths of puberty/hibernation my body, when left to its own devices, was helping itself to twelve or thirteen hours of sleep a night. That's thankfully not necessary any more, but I'm certainly not at my best when I get less than eight hours.</p>
<p>Wakemate has actually been useful for telling me when I'm not taking very good care of myself, and has provided a small but real incentive for paying attention to when I should call it a night. Admittedly, you can see that incentive diminishing in the above graph as the novelty of the WM wears off. Still, I've found the information useful.</p>
<p>Anyway, if it sounds appealing, you might want to give it a try -- although until I'm more convinced of the alarm's utility, I'd suggest considering the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.fitbit.com/">FitBit</a> as well. I haven't tried FB, but in addition to sleep analysis it quantifies your activity during the day, which might be interesting. It hasn't got any anti-sleep-inertia alarm functionality, but perhaps that'll be added later.</p>

<p>I'm sorry, but no. <a class="reference external" href="http://www.slate.com/id/2281146/pagenum/all/">It's a lousy polemic</a>. Here's its structure:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>SEO-friendly statement of controversy</li>
<li>Presentation of opinion A. Assertion that people who hold it are rubes.</li>
<li>Presentation of opinion B. Invocation of authority.</li>
<li>History lesson! Discussion of old technology; no mention of enforcement of author's preferred orthodoxy by newer technology (e.g. HTML rendering multiple spaces as one)</li>
<li>Rumination on beauty. Grecian urns, etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>For now let's ignore the ignore the bullying nature of this argument (it should be obvious to anyone that those of us who believe in two spaces are a minority that's relentlessly and mercilessly persecuted by the bloodthirsty masses, both through jeremiads like Manjoo's and through the technological eradication of our ability to express our beliefs). Which of the points in the above argument are rhetorically meaningful?</p>
<p>Only point 3 really carries any weight with me. I'll take Manjoo's word that all typographers like a single space between sentences. I'm actually pretty sympathetic to arguments from authority, being the big-state-loving paternalist that I am. But, with apologies to friends and colleagues of mine who care passionately about this stuff, I lost my patience with the typographically-obsessed community when they started trying to get me to pay attention to which sans-serif fonts were being used anachronistically on <em>Mad Men</em>.</p>
<p>I love you guys, but you're crazy. On questions of aesthetic preference there's no particular reason that normal people should listen to a bunch of geeky obsessives who spend orders of magnitude more time on these issues than average. It's like how you probably shouldn't listen to me when I tell you not to use .doc files or that you might want to consider a digital audio player with Ogg Vorbis support. I strongly believe those things, but even I know they're pointless and arbitrary for everyone who doesn't consider &quot;Save As...&quot; an opportunity for political action.</p>
<p>Nor should we assume that just because typographers believe earnestly in the single space that their belief is held entirely in good faith. They're drunk on the awesome power of their proportional fonts, and sure of the cosmic import of the minuscule kerning decisions that it is their lonely duty to make. <em>Of course</em> they don't want lowly typists exercising their opinions about letter spacing. Those people aren't qualified to have opinions!</p>
<p>(For what it's worth, I don't think you rabble should be using Flash or Silverlight or anything other than plain text in your emails. You can't be trusted with it! And, not that this motivates me or typographers at all of course (we just want what's best for you), but when you do such things it makes my job slightly harder.)</p>
<p>Manjoo's argument about beauty, like all such arguments, is easy enough to dismiss: I disagree. I find it easier to read paragraphs that are composed of sentences separated by two spaces. Perhaps this is because I, like most technologists, spend most of my time working with (quite lovely!) fixed-width fonts for practical reasons. But there's also a deeper beauty to the two space rule -- a sort of mathematical beauty. Let me explain.</p>
<p>Consider the typical structure of writing. Letters are assembled into words, which turn into phrases, which are arranged into sentences -- at the same time being assigned to speakers, a neat trick -- which are then combined into paragraphs.</p>
<p>It's a chemical process, a perfect and infinitely flexible hierarchical system that should command our admiration. Being able to rationally examine, disassemble and interrogate the final product is a mark of the system's beauty. Anything less is settling for a sort of holistic mysticism.</p>
<p>It's disrespectful to let writing's constituent elements bleed into one another through imprecise demarcations. If you see me &quot;making mistakes with comma placement&quot;, please rest assured that I'm doing it deliberately. In most cases the comma doesn't belong to the phrase delimited by the quotation marks that enclose it. Placing an exclamation point or question mark to the left or right of a close-quote is a weighty decision! That we violate the atomic purity of quotations with injected commas is an outrage.</p>
<p>And though I don't get quite as worked up about it, the same sort of thinking motivates my belief in the double space. Sentences deserve to be clearly delineated, but because of the complications of quotation, ellipses, interrogatives and exclamations (among others), there is no reliable punctuation that can be counted on as a terminator for sentences. Single spaces are already spoken for: they separate words. The double space is an elegant and subtle solution.</p>
<p>To operationalize it: I can split any of the paragraphs in this post (as composed, not as rendered) into its constituent sentences with a simple line of Python:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">[cc lang=&quot;python&quot;]</div>
<div class="line">for x in paragraph.split(' '):</div>
<div class="line">print repr(x)</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">&quot;And though I don't get quite as worked up about it, the same sort of thinking motivates my belief in the double space.&quot;</div>
<div class="line">&quot;Sentences deserve to be clearly delineated, but because of the complications of quotation, ellipses, interrogatives and exclamations (among others), there is no reliable punctuation that can be counted on as a terminator for sentences.&quot;</div>
<div class="line">&quot;Single spaces are already spoken for: they separate words.&quot;</div>
<div class="line">&quot;The double space is an elegant and subtle solution.&quot;</div>
<div class="line">[/cc]</div>
</div>
<p>Further disassembly is easy from there. I can't do that with the degenerate text that Manjoo prefers. As a journalist who makes his living on consumers' pageviews it's perhaps understandable that he would deliberately complicate news consumption for his non-human audience. But I hope the rest of us can make our aesthetic decisions a little less selfishly.</p>

                    <p>It's a little pointless to speculate about where the Arizona shooter got some of his super-crazy ideas: presumably he will eventually be medicated and/or interviewed enough to simply tell us. Still, the press's sudden fascination with David Wynn Miller strikes me as a little over-eager. There isn't really much evidence tying him to Loughner. Yes, both men seem to have strange ideas about the government using grammar as a means of mind control. It seems perfectly possible -- maybe likely -- that Miller's the source of that. But for what it's worth, I think we probably shouldn't rule out simultaneous, uh, discovery.</p>
<p>It's just that Miller's ravings aren't as novel as they might seem. Consider <a class="reference external" href="http://www.timecube.com/">timecube.com</a> (it's a lot sadder to read than it was a couple of days ago). In this case the author is convinced the government is exerting control through a conspiracy centered around the 12 hour clock. There's also plenty of railing against evil educators, biblical allusions and specious logic.</p>
<p>In Gene Ray's case it's the clock, not grammar. But it could easily have been grammar. This kind of sickness seems more about obsessive and broken thought than conceptual synthesis. Whatever bibliography we generate is going to be meaningless, and it seems a bit ludicrous to be playing name-your-influences as if Loughner had just released a debut album.</p>

                    <p>I'll keep my ill-advised and emotional reactions to the horror in Arizona confined to Twitter for now (though I should say that I'm quite certain I have a unique and trenchant perspective on the matter, having had a brief and superficial conversation about gun control with a cab driver in Phoenix last month). Let's talk about something totally different!</p>
<p>I just stumbled across a video that explains my favorite experimental neuroscience result pretty well:</p>
<div class="docutils container">
<object width="480" height="385"><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/IQ4nwTTmcgs?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="385"></embed></object></div>
<p>Libet's work isn't the conclusive case against free will that it might seem at first blush. Neural evidence of motor planning can occur without resulting action; such planning may not occur in the same way for different types of decisions; and you can come up with various free-will-as-last-minute-veto accounts that strike me as pretty lame but seem to make some people feel better. You don't <em>have</em> to accept conscious experience as an epiphenomenon. Still, I've always found the result a great means of attaining a mild but pervasive sense of existential worry, which I think is worthwhile on its own merits.</p>
<p>I was prompted (through a clear chain of causation!) to search for the video after reading <a class="reference external" href="http://www.concatenation.org/futures/whatsexpected.pdf">this</a> (PDF), via <a class="reference external" href="http://chneukirchen.org/trivium/2011-01-04">Trivium</a>. It's short and worth a look. It descends into improbable and grandiose flourishes after the first column (people like me would keep a Predictor on their keychain and then get on with their lives). But with all the excitement over <a class="reference external" href="http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2010/11/feeling-the-future-is-precognition-possible/">Daryl Bem's paper</a> that's arisen during the last few months, I'm feeling pretty good about my odds of being able to buy a Predictor-like gadget from <a class="reference external" href="http://www.dealextreme.com/">DealExtreme</a> in the next decade or two.</p>

In it, Patton Oswalt laments the cooption of geek culture by the masses. He lovingly describes his youth as a Northern Virginian Otaku, and laments that culture’s adoption by the mainstream.</p>
<p>I’m sympathetic, but Oswalt is totally wrong. It’s not a problem that jocks like <em>Watchmen</em> or <em>Buffy</em> or whatever else. It’s great that they do. If something has artistic value, it should be enjoyed by as many people as possible.</p>
<p>I get that this stuff feels like a life raft to teenagers in legitimate pain; that it provides a sense of identity for outcasts. I was one of those kids. But I’ve reluctantly concluded that it’s not healthy to create these islands of identity. Imbuing pop culture with value, then borrowing that value for yourself — it’s not a winning formula. If kids who can throw footballs know who Boba Fett is, and if that cuts the legs out from under some aspiring introverts… I guess I think that that’s a good thing, even if it’s painful for them in the moment.</p>
<p>Oswalt’s lamenting the destruction of the nerd ghetto, and proposing that we build a new one. That’s an understandable impulse, but it’s wrong. Undercutting the drive to self-victimize can appear cruel when considered in the context of young people’s deliberate and inevitable victimization of one another. But the alternative isn’t really mercy; it’s just assisted masochism.</p>

                    <p>I'm a bit late to this, but for the record: it's extremely disappointing to see the most important cyclist advocacy organization in the city <a class="reference external" href="http://waba.org/blog/2010/12/resolve-to-set-the-stage-for-even-stronger-advocacy-in-2011/">concern trolling its own members</a>. &nbsp;As others have noted at length, the proposed pledge to more lawful behavior is both insulting and potentially unwise:&nbsp;complete and mechanical obedience to the rules of the road can be dangerous in its own right. &nbsp;I'd say I'm pretty scrupulous about following the law -- dorky hand signals and everything! -- but if you think I'm going to hang out in a left turn lane facing a red light but no oncoming traffic, waiting for someone to plow into me from behind, you're nuts.</p>
<p>I get pretty upset when I see someone salmoning up a one-way street or failing to yield the right of way, but the actual incidence of serious cyclist misbehavior seems to me to be relatively small. &nbsp;In the same way that many motorists habitually execute rolling stops, or fail to signal, or go five miles over the speed limit, cyclists commit a lot of offenses that don't represent serious safety problems. &nbsp;No one spends much time bemoaning drivers' peccadilloes because we're used to them. &nbsp;But first-hand experience of biking through the city is still pretty rare. It's unfortunate, but I think that without such experience, drivers are unqualified to weigh in on what constitutes dangerous behavior, and consequently overstate the problem of cyclist recklessness to an astounding degree. &nbsp;In perfect world everyone would make at least a few commutes using each mode (and in the presence of users of other modes) before engaging with this topic.</p>
<p>Motorists often mistake their own surprise for evidence of a safety problem. &nbsp;This is understandable; we should all resolve to surprise each other as little as possible on the road. &nbsp;But sometimes a driver's surprise represents proof of a cyclist's erratic behavior, and sometimes it's just evidence of the driver's lack of experience around bikes.</p>
<p>I think folks behind the wheel are used to having responsibility vested with them. &nbsp;As is often repeated, they're in control of deadly weapons. &nbsp;A burden of responsibility is understandably placed on them, rather than pedestrians. &nbsp;Unfortunately, the speed and vulnerability of cyclists combined with drivers' inexperience around them makes this two-party arrangement untenable. &nbsp;Cyclists have to adopt a patronizing attitude toward people in cars: to declare themselves the judges of how the street should be navigated. We're the most vulnerable; no one else is willing to take charge of keeping us safe. &nbsp;If we decline that responsibility, it's our own asses.</p>
<p>This isn't an ideal state of affairs. &nbsp;The burden should be shared, and codified by law. And it really can be that way! &nbsp;I rode in the Netherlands this fall; that's how things work there. But that experience was both inspiring and depressing: believe me when I say that we are nowhere near ready to rely wholly on the rules of the road in the way that American drivers and all of the Dutch are able to (the only time I have been hit by a car as an adult, I was completely in compliance with the law; the driver simply didn't expect a bike to be there). &nbsp;The current situation will obtain in most American cities for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>Besides, sharing the road is a pain in the ass. &nbsp;That's just the truth: it would be a lot more convenient for me if there weren't any cars in the street, and it would be a lot more convenient for the drivers of those cars if I walked to work. &nbsp;That's just how it goes. &nbsp;Some folks in cars are never going to be happy that I'm on the street, on a bike.</p>
<p>Safely navigating the city on a bike and keeping drivers happy are goals that are somewhat in tension. &nbsp;Trying to meet drivers' motivated and at times incoherent expectations is a losing proposition. &nbsp;Changing those expectations is the only way forward, and the only way to do that is to get more bikes on the road. &nbsp;I wish WABA's staff was focused on that task instead of spending time scolding the people they're supposed to be representing.</p>

<p>On the one hand, you've got online ticket agents (OTAs) like Orbitz, Kayak and the like. On the other you've got the airlines. In between are the <strong>global distribution systems (GDSes)</strong>. These are the centralized reservation databases that are used by airline staff when they have to book you a new flight on another airline; they're the things that were used by travel agents back when travel agents still existed. The OTAs use them, too -- though the situation here gets a little bit complicated, as some of the OTAs are in bed with and/or wholly owned by the GDSes. GDSes aren't just price aggregator: they do various complicated things like hold tickets for you while you're in the process of checking out through a travel site. They're sort of like stock exchanges for airline tickets.</p>
<p>The key thing to realize is this: the GDSes are old systems, and represent something that is at least a bit cartel-<em>like</em>. They introduce friction; they charge fees. They're middlemen who serve other middlemen. If we can manage it, eliminating our collective reliance on them would be a good idea. Disintermediation should benefit the consumer!</p>
<p>As I understand it, American Airlines is asking the travel search engines to talk to AA's systems directly instead of going through a GDS. Perhaps this is a temporary tactic that's being used to put pressure on a particular GDS as AA renegotiates the terms of their contract. Perhaps it's an earnest effort to begin tearing down the overcomplicated system currently governing airline booking. I don't know. What I do know is that AA is getting a pretty raw deal in the media. I find it astounding that any reporter could be so credulous as to write <a class="reference external" href="http://www.tnooz.com/2010/12/23/news/expedia-removes-american-airlines-fares-in-support-of-orbitz/">this story</a>. Expedia's offering moral support to Orbitz? Right. Sure.</p>
<p>So look, I don't know how much goodwill AA deserves in this situation. But all that they're asking Orbitz to do is talk to their systems directly. This would involve some technical work by Orbitz, but would allow for the elimination of a Ticketmaster-like entity that's currently involved in the purchase of air travel. That could potentially mean lower prices. What they're <em>not</em> doing is saying, &quot;Sorry consumer, I don't care about the extra hassle I'm causing you; you're just going to have to search for and buy tickets straight from our own site so that I can avoid paying any helpful search engines a booking fee.&quot; (This, incidentally, is exactly what Southwest, jetBlue and various other discount airlines used to/still do, but for some reason it didn't stop anyone from loving them). If they were doing that, I'd be a lot more sympathetic to the hue and cry that's being kicked up. As it is, this is just a business flexing its muscle to get out from under a gatekeeper's thumb. I'm all for it.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>There were two good pieces on NPR this morning discussing the reaction to Wikileaks.</p>
<p>First, there's <a class="reference external" href="http://www.npr.org/2010/12/13/131979010/corporations-are-drawn-into-wikileaks-controversy">this story</a>, which briefly gets at some of the concerns about Twitter as a platform for activism that I tried to express in <a class="reference external" href="http://www.prospect.org/cs/articles?article=the_cost_of_hashtag_revolution">this piece</a>. The point Shirky makes is an important one: so much vital expression now happens in privately-controlled mediums that nominal speech rights are often a bit beside the point. This, combined with the fact that we seem to be relitigating the &quot;should shield laws apply to bloggers?&quot; question, makes me think that we're collectively more confused about how you can and ought to be able to speak on the internet than I would've expected. Hopefully we'll muddle our way through to a productive conclusion.</p>
<p>Second, they did a piece <a class="reference external" href="http://www.npr.org/2010/12/13/132015315/as-u-s-hunts-hacktivists-some-ask-is-it-worth-it">discussing the costs of prosecuting participants in Operation Payback</a>, and it's also worth a read. I'm sympathetic to the basic dilemma: going after the participants is a lot like calling in Interpol for a vandalism case. Individual actors are only responsible for substantial damage when considered together; and nobody's very happy about the idea of locking up bored rich kids. Still, it's worth keeping in mind that <em>this is what a hard computer crime problem looks like</em>. It's not thrilling to me to read that the FBI and DOJ are basically shrugging their shoulders and saying, &quot;Eh, that sounds too hard.&quot; This is all the more galling when these agencies <em>are</em> bothering to pursue computer crime enforcement agendas around intellectual property. Like it or not, distributed international attacks are the class of problem most in need of solving.</p>
<p>One other thing I'd add: keep an eye on how useful the &quot;cybersecurity&quot; community makes itself during this process. My guess is that they'll keep their traps shut (or at least spend their time gleefully fretting about what kind of funding requests Stuxnet will necessitate) while the &quot;computer security&quot; community does the hard work of grappling with the Operation Payback DDoS. On the other hand, I suppose the cybersec guys were probably the ones behind DDoSing Wikileaks, so, y'know, your tax dollars at work.</p>
<p>Third: about that DDoS. I'm not sure what to say about it, really. I find the argument that it <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cpeterson.org/2009/07/21/in-praise-of-some-ddoss/">can be considered civil disobedience</a> to be more compelling than I would've expected. I'm somewhat sympathetic to arguments like the one <a class="reference external" href="http://timothyblee.com/2010/12/10/the-case-against-ddos/">Tim makes here</a> (or that's discussed in <a class="reference external" href="http://www.deannazandt.com/2010/12/12/legitimate-civil-disobedience-wikileaks-and-the-layers-of-backlash/comment-page-1/#comment-46538">this comment</a>). But I think the idea that past instances of civil disobedience were done in an orderly manner by uniformly thoughtful people who did their best not to inconvenience anyone else is probably wishful thinking. I'm no expert on this stuff, but that strikes me as the sort of perceptual shift that happens after a movement is vindicated by history. You're going to have to piss some people off. Otherwise you might as well go schedule a protest march for all the good it'll do you.</p>
<p>And although I'm not particularly sympathetic to Payback's targeting of Amazon — cowardly though the firm's behavior may have been, too many others rely on the AWS infrastructure, and there are plenty of hosts out there — the payment-processing and DNS control points now being counter-attacked by Operation Payback really do represent worrying concentrations of power. These systems are controlled by entities that are immune to public oversight, yet seem to be completely compliant when state agents ask them to restrict their customers' liberty. That's a recipe that should worry libertarians a lot more than it seems to.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there's Gawker. And although it's probably a mistake to conflate all of these actors, there do seem to be some connections. The &quot;Anonymous&quot; community is becoming a sort of petulant digital Fight Club that's going to be very difficult to combat, and which behaves in a chaotic and unprincipled manner. That they're targeting those who <em>dare to talk about them</em> is pretty dismaying; that the only way to respond seems likely to be a combination of quiet state cooption of ISPs and throwing children in jail — that's incredibly depressing.</p>
