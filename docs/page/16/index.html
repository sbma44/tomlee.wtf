                    <p>So, look: the conservatives have a point: this movie does not present an even-handed consideration of the case for rapacious, imperial, homicidal, psychotic resource extraction. Probably there are some really cool consumer electronics that were made possible by burning down the ancestral homeland of that indigenous population!&nbsp; Not once does James Cameron's script discuss the boost in Na'vi GDP made possible by the incineration of their psychic soul tree thing.&nbsp; For shame.</p>
<p>Seriously, though: any conservatives who object to this movie are automatically giving up the game.&nbsp; Are you really taking offense at a polemic against <em>murdering natives and destroying the environment for naked greed?</em> Really: you think your ideological program stands in opposition to the idea of not killing innocent people and stealing their land?&nbsp; I mean, if that's the war you want to fight, be my guest.&nbsp; We can deal with that.&nbsp; But I sort of thought we had called a truce and agreed that we were all trying to figure out a positive-sum way to reconcile our unbearable hippie nonsense with your corporate overlords' ruthlessness.&nbsp; We were all going to drink Coca-cola in idyllic natural settings, no?&nbsp; I guess I just think it might be better for you to sit this one out.</p>
<p>But whatever. All that aside, it really was an awesome movie, in the original sense of the word.&nbsp; A lot of comparisons are being made to a lot of different movies, but I think the most relevant one is <em>The Fifth Element</em>. Like Jim Cameron, Luc Besson made a bunch of great movies, then revisited a story he had been mulling since before he could conceive of decent stories.&nbsp; <em>The Fifth Element</em> was a visually arresting, relentlessly kinetic and occasionally emotionally-compelling spectacle, and because of all that it didn't really matter that its core was totally risible <em>Captain Planet</em> bullshit.</p>
<p>I think the same can be said of <em>Avatar</em>.&nbsp; This movie would be better without narration. It would probably be better without dialogue!&nbsp; But by saying that I don't mean to imply that it's trading solely in effects-driven flash rather than story.&nbsp; It's just that the story is so vast, so archetypal, that the specifics don't matter, and are consequently allowed to devolve into camp (really: <a class="reference external" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0298814/">unobtainium</a>?).&nbsp; THIS IS A BIG FUCKING MOVIE.&nbsp; That's all I can really say about it with any sense of confidence.&nbsp; That, and: go see it.&nbsp; Wear the stupid glasses.&nbsp; You'll like it.</p>

                    <p>Yglesias <a class="reference external" href="http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/archives/2009/12/memo-to-michael-wolff-bitch-is-a-sexist-term.php">responds</a> to Michael Wolff's ruminations on Chuck Schumer calling a flight attendant a bitch:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...by eliding the term “bitch” he manages to completely avoid the subject of sexism, which I think is at the core of the complaint here. But the term is a pure contentless gender-slur. It’s like you’re saying “I disagree with what you’re doing and also you’re a woman which is a bad thing to be!!!!!!!!”</p>
<p>Even if a woman is doing something legitimately bad, it’s no more appropriate to insult her with that term than it is to break out a racial slur just because a guy you have a legitimate beef with happens to be black. That’s the issue here.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Disclaimer: &quot;bitch&quot; is not a term I like nor one that I use. When I hear other people use it, I think less of them.</p>
<p>But I'm not sure that what Yglesias says above is correct. I wrote something about this years ago, but it came out hopelessly muddled, so let's try again.</p>
<p>The difficulty here is in figuring out what we find objectionable about the word. It's easy to become confused by the fact that pejorative language is reserved for unpleasant situations, and give in to the temptation to think that wishing away the word will also make those situations disappear. Yglesias understands that this is stupid way of thinking: people will continue to get upset with one another. And although it's obvious that we should all strive to be pleasant human beings, there's nothing necessarily unjust about expressing your strong dislike for someone. Rather, it's the act of denigration-via-classification embodied by these terms that makes them so odious. This is also correct, I think.</p>
<p>But the comparison to racist language is problematic. It seems to me that as a society we've pretty much decided that acknowledging racial differences is inappropriate except in very specific circumstances. It sounds a little weird when you put it that way, but I think it's essentially what we've done and that it's basically a good idea -- a custom that pushes human behavior in positive directions.</p>
<p>It's not clear to me that a similar societal decision has been made with respect to gender differences. I say this primarily because most people continue to think it's fine to use gendered pronouns. And if that's all right, I don't necessarily see an inherent problem with gendered pejoratives (though certainly there can be circumstances surrounding their use that are profoundly problematic -- the practical case against the word &quot;bitch&quot; is quite strong, I think). Heroine/hero, she/he, bitch/dick. There's a low-resolution take on the continuum. The fact that only the last pair would strike most people as objectionable makes me think that we're facing the situation I talked about above: wishing that people wouldn't get angry with one another and use harsh language. That's a fine thing to wish for, but I don't think it's got much to do with social justice.</p>
<p>The other possibility, of course, is that we should be objecting to gendered pronouns with positive or neutral affect (e.g. heroine, she) as well, just the same as we don't use different words for valorous people of different races. I think this is probably correct, but I also think it's probably not a position that most of the people engaging in this debate would find appealing enough on an intuitive level to embrace. Come to think of it, resistance to the social project of eliminating gendered pronouns could easily be the thing that eventually earns the &quot;cultural conservative&quot; trophy for my generation (take heart, though, future young people: we'll be dead before you know it).</p>

                    <p>A few weeks ago <a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/sasara">Sara</a> mentioned to me that she was enjoying a band called Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros. I would've been sold on the strength of the name alone; a friend's recommendation was more than enough to make me resolve to give them a listen.</p>
<p>It took me a couple of weeks, though (and an additional tweet from <a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/mstem">Matt</a>) before I got around to it. To be honest, I'm not sure I'm a fan of the album. I find large parts of it to be a bit boring; other parts remind me -- for reasons I can't quite identify -- of the sort of bloated, Fleetwood-Mac-ian WASH-FM rock that echoes off receptionist desks all over this town.</p>
<p>But &quot;Home&quot; -- goddamn, what a song.</p>
<blockquote>
<a class="reference external" href="/mp3/Edward%20Sharpe%20and%20the%20Magnetic%20Zeros%20-%20Home.mp3">Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros – Home</a></blockquote>
<p>There are a lot of things to like about it. I could've been counted as a fan on the basis of the Morricone-isms alone. And I'm a complete sucker for the female vocal, which has the sort of breathy, stretching-after-a-nap timbre that only happens when a really cute girl picks up a serious cigarette habit.</p>
<p>But more than that, it's an amazing recorded performance between the two singers, one that evokes a genre tradition but invigorates it with a sense of utter, honest vulnerability. I haven't heard anything like it in a while.</p>
<p>If someone stuck you in a studio, said &quot;We're rolling, <em>try to sound in love</em>&quot;, could you do it this well? I'm left completely charmed, slightly wary, and unsure whether to believe in the singers' talents or (god) their love. I may vaguely hate them for making me write that sentence, but I can't deny that the sound they make together is miraculous.</p>

                    <p>Earlier this week my old boss, JP, sent me a note saying that the full-text RSS script I'd written was being shut down.&nbsp; EchoDitto was nice enough to continue hosting it on their servers, but it had been consuming an increasing share of resources, and finally it needed to be killed.&nbsp; Sad.</p>
<p>Then, horrifying.&nbsp; JP had mentioned it idly, but until I saw the Google Alert for <a class="reference external" href="http://www.blackhatworld.com/blackhat-seo/blackhat-lounge/145882-echodittolabs-down.html">this</a> I didn't quite realize what had been going on.&nbsp; The self-described black-hat search engine optimization crowd -- the folks who assemble sites peppered with ads that are designed to attract search engine traffic, aka &quot;link farms&quot; -- had been using my script to steal other people's content and republish it on their own sites.&nbsp; Using this sort of genuine content helped them snag traffic more effectively than they could with the gibberish that you sometimes see in spam, so they were sorry to see the script go.</p>
<p>Well, I appreciate the attention, but it's not exactly what I had in mind for my work when I released it.&nbsp; So I explained the situation, and bid them adieu:</p>

<p>I was at least somewhat aware of this danger, and consequently didn't open-source the code (thank goodness).&nbsp; It was still a bit of a shock to see the reality of what I'd wrought, though.</p>
<p>I still believe what I wrote in that <a class="reference external" href="http://echodittolabs.org/blog/2007/05/full-text-rss">initial post</a>: it's pointless for online publishers to try to control how their readers consume content.&nbsp; If you wish to publish digitally, you need to accept the realities that come with doing so.&nbsp; Pretending otherwise is just going to inconvenience your readers and slow your business's necessary evolution.&nbsp; Prolonging that process seems likely to increase the painfulness of the process, not eliminate it.</p>
<p>For those curious, the algorithm was exactly what many in comments had guessed.&nbsp; I used some regular expressions to build a hierarchical structure representing all the &lt;div&gt; and &lt;td&gt; elements in each page associated with an RSS item.&nbsp; These tags are the ones most often used to provide a page's layout, and the full text of an entry can usually be found in a single instance of such a container.&nbsp; I then traversed this structure, looking for the text excerpt from the original RSS item.&nbsp; Once found, the rest of that container's contents could be pulled out.&nbsp; It's a simple idea, though the realities of HTML -- and the difficulty of preserving byte offsets between a sanitized working copy and the original -- made the actual implementation require quite a bit more cleverness (and caching) than it may sound like.</p>
<p>The result worked pretty well. Still, there were a few problems with the approach.&nbsp; For one thing, comments were frequently included in the same container as the main entry.&nbsp; For another, the script would fail if the RSS entry text was a summary of the item rather than an excerpt. I think that both of these are surmountable problems: a better approach would examine the &quot;textiness&quot; of each container using a variety of scoring metrics.&nbsp; Something similar could be used for detecting the start of comments (which tend to be peppered with timestamps, quotations of the original text, and occur after a big &lt;h[1-6]&gt; containing the word &quot;comment&quot;).&nbsp; I took a stab at a new, Pythonic implementation using Adrian Holovaty's <a class="reference external" href="http://www.holovaty.com/writing/templatemaker/">templatemaker</a> and a few other tools, but a lack of immediate success (and much higher computational demands than the original script) made the project fall by the wayside.&nbsp; Now that I know how it might be used, I'm even less likely to pick it back up.</p>
<p>But I'd still love to see my algorithm adapted by the people who make RSS readers, and would be happy to talk to any interested and qualified parties about making that happen.&nbsp; Those SEO morons don't appear to be particularly technically proficient -- I'm not too worried about them managing to steal content via a client-side app (though certainly some thought should be given to the matter before giving the store away, say via Applescript).</p>

                    <p>If you ask me, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/06/us/06charity.html?_r=1&amp;sudsredirect=true">this New York Times article</a> is fairly asinine.&nbsp; Is our collective decision to exempt the nonprofit sector from taxation a good idea? Well, I don't know.&nbsp; I think you can make a pretty good case that it isn't -- that the sorts of problems that charities try to solve would be more constructively handled with coordinated state action, and that there's not much of a reason at all for exempting various types of membership organizations from taxation.</p>
<p>But the article really doesn't get into any of that.&nbsp; Instead it just talks about the large <em>number of nonprofits</em>, rather than discussing where the big tax expenditures actually lie.&nbsp; Then they throw in some anecdotes about charities for donkey rescue and sending clown noses to soldiers, which, ha ha, sound pretty stupid to readers that don't care about donkeys or clown supplies (but probably do care about various tax-exempt universities with big endowments and profitable sports programs (also tax-free) that've <em>still</em> been raising tuition much faster than inflation).</p>
<p>At any rate, we're working on the nonprofit sector over at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.subsidyscope.com">Subsidyscope</a>, and will have more to say about it soon. But for now, suffice it to say that health care and education is where the money is in the nonprofit sector.&nbsp; Podunk institutes and foundations that seem to be put together to secure prestige for their organizers more than to do good works might offend our sensibilities, but they're not really costing our government all that much money.</p>

                    <p>I should take this opportunity to note the awesomeness of last night's premiere of <em>Steven Seagal: Lawman</em>. Gabe Delahaye ably sums up the basic mechanic that they've established for the season:</p>
<p><img alt="image1" class="aligncenter" src="/static/2009/12/03/seagal-20091203-160858.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 154px;" /></p>
<p>But it's oh-so-much more than just a crappy, bloated, arthritic has-been hassling poor black men in run-down parts of Louisiana.&nbsp; There's also the poorly-affected cajun accent! And the constant prefacing of every utterance with &quot;as a lifelong practitioner of the martial arts...&quot;! And the relentless pomposity that Seagal directs at his fellow officers, like a tourist advising a gypsy how to better beg for coins.&nbsp; He gives driving directions; he helps a supposedly hapless overweight colleague train for firearm certification; he expounds wisely and constantly on how his wisdom offsets the constant danger that they're all in (nice kevlar vest, incidentally! Though I couldn't help but notice that the officers who aren't unstoppable human weapons don't seem to feel they need them...).</p>
<p>It's a great, great show, is what I'm trying to say. Talk to your Tivo about it.</p>

I mean, <em>The Pina Colada Song</em>? That's bold. But it's also sort of strangely big-hearted, and makes me tempted to compare Davis to my friend Chris, which Chris doesn't like because he worries that people with beards all look the same to the rest of us, and that's prejudice.</div>
<div class="line">There is one problem with Davis' interview, though, and it leaves me in the awkward position of needing to stick up for Dan Snyder.

<p>Citation desperately needed! Snyder bought the park in 2005, and I'm certain I've seen Mr. Six dancing away his bankruptcy worries since then. More importantly, it should go without saying that the character was never popular, and rarely even tolerable.</p>

                    <p>Hi there. You might have noticed me not blogging. Well, work's been busy, and I've been uninspired by the post-Halloween lull. Mostly I've been retreating into messing around with videogames and technology in an unproductive way (though I <em>have</em> leveled up quite a bit).</p>
<p>Some things that happened:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Charles put on a classical guitar concert! It was pretty great: those in attendance were unanimous in their affection for Charles' guitar playing and their horror at my turn as a page-turner. &quot;Creepy&quot; and &quot;cadaverous&quot; were adjectives that may have been applied. Oh well. The bigger problem was the audience's unwillingness to travel through the rain to our apartment after the show, which led me to consume considerably more cheese and red wine than could be strictly justified within the evening's sophisticated sensibility.</li>
<li>WEP-cracking: as easy as the nerds have warned you. Well, if there's a client associated. I'm still figuring out how to efficiently manage it when it's just me versus the access point. But though it took a little work, running Backtrack 4 off a bootable USB drive lets weaponize my eeePC 1005HA pretty efficiently. Airoscript-ng is giving me some MAC address-related guff, but I'll sort it out eventually. Next up: tackling the considerably-more-formidable WPA.</li>
<li>I'm pretty sure that I have tendonitis from trying to play &quot;Feel the Pain&quot; on hard in <em>Rock Band 2</em>.</li>
<li></li>
<li><em>Borderlands</em> is really fun. Or if not fun, then compelling. Or if not compelling, then addictive. And if addictive, then debilitating. An FPS where you collect experience points: dear lord someone save me from this waking nightmare but not until I get just a little more (I can use this new fire revolver at level 26) and oh god what have I become</li>
<li>I'm working on a neat electronics project for the new office at work, though it's driving me slightly insane as I try to get python running on a WRT54GL. Turns out it's harder than getting it to run on a Fonera! Which is unexpected and therefore dumb. More on this when it's actually finished.</li>
<li>It looks like I'll probably be heading to Tbilisi in early December to help an NGO get their mobile and web infrastructure up and running. It's exciting! But the whirlwind nature of the trip is making me dread travel involved. I get a day in London on the way over, but heading back involves a 19 hour itinerary of flights. Ugh.</li>

                    <p>Halloween's over, and I've finally started to reassemble the pieces of my shattered life.&nbsp; It's amazing how one little coffin-and-spider-construction project can derail gym attendance, laundry completion and sleep.</p>
<p>But man, it was a good party.&nbsp; People danced all night; the booze held out; no one got sick; no one's costume was ignited by a candle; and even the many, many people who fell down the stairs all emerged miraculously unhurt. Then, at the end, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7y1tynWh5WI">Blelvis</a> showed up.&nbsp; Thanks to everyone who came, and especially those of you who elected not to steal anything.&nbsp; You can find photos <a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/fickeween/">here</a> that prove the whole thing happened (and if you have photos of your own, please consider uploading them to Flickr with the tag &quot;fickeween&quot;).</p>
<p>Now! As you might know, this was the third installment of this particular party in this particular house.&nbsp; Unfortunately, it might be the last: the house is on the market, and although the asking price seems to reflect the owners' relative prioritization of, say, fake Tiffany lamps versus, say, non-leaking roofs, it's possible that we'll need a new venue for next October. Please get in touch if you or someone you know has access to a network of abandoned steam tunnels, or parents who are using their retirement to renovate abandoned mental hospitals, or even just knowledge of a cave that stretches deep -- deeper than human feet should tread -- toward the eldritch horrors at the Earth's core.</p>

<p>I think this debate has stagnated.&nbsp; People are continuing to act as if the FCC's plan is a complete unknown. This enables the lazy &quot;evil corporation/incompetent government&quot; frame that we all know and love. At one point this was at least semi-appropriate.&nbsp; People -- including those like Cerf, Farber and Kahn -- made guesses about what was likely to happen, largely based on their own position along the regulation/markets ideological spectrum. &quot;The government is trying to outlaw QoS!&quot; &quot;The ISPs are going to charge for Google!&quot;&nbsp; Both of these positions were hyperbolic.</p>
<p>But look, there's a difference now: the FCC has announced its <a class="reference external" href="http://www.openinternet.gov/read-speech.html#book5">NN principles</a>, to thundering... well, there hasn't been much reaction, actually.&nbsp; Everyone's just pretending that nothing happened and sticking to their guns.&nbsp; &quot;The principles are too vague!&quot; they cry, even though those principles say that allowances will be made for necessary network management, that throttling heavy users will be okay, that malware can be filtered, that copyright law can be enforced, and that managed services can be developed and sold.&nbsp; That wipes out a significant swath of the ISPs' objections.</p>
<p>Yet no one seems to have noticed. <a class="reference external" href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/posttech/2009/10/computer_science_professor_dav.html">Here's Farber responding to the new principles</a> -- he doesn't particularly object to them, he just thinks they're too vague and that they might make ISPs wary of trying to innovate (as if the research costs to network management are so great that the potential for work product to be shot down makes it impractical; please, this is <em>software</em>).&nbsp; He also says they'll lead to a bunch of lawsuits, though he simultaneously says we should instead rely on the DOJ and FTC to handle this (in a rule-free environment!), which makes just about no sense to me.</p>
<p>I digress.&nbsp; Look: the FCC has put some of its cards on the table.&nbsp; Not all!&nbsp; Rulemaking still needs to occur (if it didn't, opponents would be even more outraged).&nbsp; But the agency <em>has</em> signaled that it's not actually going to do the incredibly idiotic things that neutrality opponents claimed it would. Those people need to acknowledge this fact, and come up with a clarified set of objections. What is it, exactly, that the FCC's stated plans are going to stop you from doing? Right now I'm just seeing a bunch of now-irrelevant FUD; some talk about how great a monopolistic IPTV market would be; and some hand-waving about &quot;new business models&quot;, which I take to be a synonym for &quot;rent-seeking&quot;.&nbsp; It's time to admit that the FCC isn't the one being vague.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>Matt has taken <a class="reference external" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/manifestdensitynet/~3/G5TwQ8E8AtU/">my offhanded complaint about DC beer prices</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/archives/2009/10/the-wages-of-high-wages.php">placed it within the context of social justice</a>, noting that DC's high wages account for its high beer prices (our average drink prices are comparable to New York's; our median annual wage, at $57.1k, is somewhat higher than New York's, at $52.8k; both are significantly above the national median of $42.3k). His basic project is all to the good: thus is the charge of any thoughtful person concerned with the common weal and/or our ability to drink away worries about the state it's in.</p>
<p>However! I object to his specific analysis of the situation for two reasons.</p>
<p>The first concerns the relevance of the wage figures Matt cites -- I think the average DC beer-buyer is poorer than those numbers imply.&nbsp; Matt's reliance on pan-workforce statistics is understandable, but still insufficient for the task at hand. One needs to look at the <em>bar-going</em> slice of the population in order to characterize the market for happy hour beer. Sadly, the BLS does not consider this a focus of their work. However! Both New York and DC are on the <a class="reference external" href="http://pewresearch.org/pubs/1380/marriage-and-divorce-by-state">high end</a> of the marriage age spectrum, so let's assume that bar-going rates are roughly similar for both populations. I contend that DC's drinking class is likely to be impoverished relative to New York's, for two reasons. First, DC's young professionals are likely to have a substantially larger average debt burden than those of New York, given that we have <a class="reference external" href="http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/GRTTable?_bm=y&amp;-_box_head_nbr=R1503&amp;-ds_name=ACS_2008_1YR_G00_&amp;-_lang=en&amp;-format=US-30&amp;-CONTEXT=grt">twice the incidence of graduate degrees</a> and, one imagines, student loans (<strong>UPDATE:</strong> <a class="reference external" href="http://dcist.com/2009/12/dc_grads_have_the_most_college_debt.php">proof</a>!). Second: while I don't have stats to back it up, the incidence of unpaid internships in this city must be abnormally high, even when compared to New York's wage-depressed economy of starry-eyed small-town dreamers.</p>
<p>The second objection is based on evidence that the supply of alcohol in DC is artificially constrained, producing higher prices than would otherwise be found. I'm pretty sure that Matt's aware of this effect, because I think I stole the idea from him. Namely: the terrible regulatory situation faced by DC bars. A <a class="reference external" href="http://www.trans.abc.state.ny.us/JSP/query/PublicQueryAdvanceSearchPage.jsp">search</a> for retailers licensed to sell alcohol for on-premises consumption in New York, NY yields 14,718 records. An extremely generous summing of <a class="reference external" href="http://abra.dc.gov/abra/cwp/view,A,1272,Q,635589.asp">DC's licensed alcohol sellers</a> — I included everyone but grocery stores, liquor stores and caterers — shows 1,039 licensees. Normalizing this to population is challenging: liquor licenses aren't administered at the MSA level, and it should be obvious that a larger proportion of DC's happy hour attendees are from the suburbs than is the case for New York. But Wikipedia puts the workday population of DC at <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_dc">around a million</a>, so let's run with that number. If we do, we can see that DC has 1.039 milli-watering holes per capita (mWHPC), versus a robust 1.760 mWHPC for New York City (using per capita rates across the entire population -- not just the bar-going segment -- because of our our assumption that the demographics (if not the economics) of bar attendance are similar in both cities). Even using the formal population of DC (591,833) leaves New York in the lead, with a DC score of 1.756. And this is to say nothing of <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_call_%28bar_term%29#US_State_specific_laws">New York's later last call</a>, which provides the city's residents with 8.3% more drinking hours per bar (marginal though they may be).&nbsp; Normalizing the mWHPC score to DC's last call, New York emerges with a commanding 1.91 mWHPC<sub>w(2AM)</sub> -- nearly twice as much as DC!*</p>
<p>The significance of this disparity is bolstered by looking at alcohol consumption stats.&nbsp; These are actually pretty hard to track down on an MSA level, and obviously state figures won't do when making comparisons to DC. <a class="reference external" href="http://oas.samhsa.gov/96state/appendix.htm#AppC">This</a> admittedly-dated survey is about the best I could find, and shows a rate of alcohol use over a 30-day window that's five percentage points higher for DC than New York. All else being equal, one would assume that the per-capita quantity of bars would be higher in harder-drinking cities.&nbsp; Yet in this case we see exactly the opposite.</p>
<p>This all suggests to me that wages aren't the whole story -- at least when that story is told in comparison to New York -- and that regulatory forces play a significant role in distorting the DC market for alcohol by keeping supply artificially low relative to demand.</p>
<p>* As I went to sleep last night I realized that, unless something has changed since I last stayed out late and DC bars are now open for 24 of the day's 26 hours, my math is wrong. The real percentage increase caused by a later last call should probably be substantially higher, even though a contrary effect should be introduced by applying something like a discount rate to the extra hours themselves.&nbsp; So I can't really propose a firm number, though using no discount and assuming drinking begins at 5pm would give you an adjustment weight of 1.22; it therefore seems safe to say that New York's weighted score should be no more than 2.15.</p>

                    <p>Not to undercut <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ryanavent.com/blog/?p=2239">Ryan's point</a>, which seems to me to be correct — geoengineering probably <em>is</em> much harder than its boosters currently think, and anyone who ignores the experts calling for first taking a crack at emission reduction is a dope — but I think his point's getting a bit lost in all the me-too-ery. <a class="reference external" href="http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2009/10/geoengineering-freakiness">Here's Kevin Drum</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
But geoengineering isn't something that a single country can pull off. It's a global problem, after all. That means treaties and conferences and endless debate over costs and benefits and what the target temperatures ought to be and who's responsible for side effects. There just aren't any easy answers here.</blockquote>
<p>I'm pretty sure this is wrong: geoengineering <em>is</em> something that a single country could pull off.&nbsp; That's sort of the whole point. The Atlantic got <a class="reference external" href="http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200907/climate-engineering">a bunch of experts to say exactly that</a> earlier this year -- actually, they say it's something that Richard Branson could manage if he were so inclined.</p>
<p>And, contrary to what's being asserted, I think history makes it clear that undertaking massive scientific and engineering projects that put foreigners at risk is something that's actually pretty easy to get away with. I mean, consider that time we <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhopal_disaster">gassed tens of thousands of Indians to death</a>. Or that time we were worried about <a class="reference external" href="http://www.fas.org/sgp/othergov/doe/lanl/docs1/00329010.pdf">the Manhattan Project igniting the atmosphere</a> (PDF) but went ahead with it anyway. Or US agribusiness's release of GM food products into the wild. Or all the space junk we've flown up over and crashed down past foreign countries. And that's to say nothing of the environmental devastation that the first world has wrought upon any number of countries with resources we fancy.</p>
<p>Again, this isn't to minimize the argument that geoengineering is unlikely to be the simple cure-all that some imagine. I'm certainly no expert on the subject, but that seems right to me.</p>
<p>But if we decided we wanted to do it, it's pretty hard for me to imagine anyone stopping us. That's the appeal of these solutions: they sidestep the collective action problem that CO<sub>2</sub> reduction represents.&nbsp; You could (and should) attach to geoengineering proposals the same collaborative hurdles that emission reduction requires.&nbsp; But you don't really <em>have</em> to.&nbsp; I'm sure you'd see some flushed faces around Turtle Bay if we started pumping sulfur dioxide out of military jets circling the globe, but no number of submarine meetings of the Maldives cabinet could seriously dissuade a superpower from undertaking some mad science in the face of what it earnestly believes to be an existential threat.&nbsp; Hell, it might even be possible to dump SO<sub>2</sub> into the atmosphere in a sufficiently diffuse way that other countries couldn't easily prove we'd done it.&nbsp; You know, like how the government is using <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemtrail">chemtrails</a> to build an electromagnetic superweapon.</p>

                    <p>Matt sent me <a class="reference external" href="http://yle.fi/uutiset/news/2009/10/1mb_broadband_access_becomes_legal_right_1080940.html">this link</a>, which mentions that Finland has just declared broadband access a legal right. By next summer, all Finnish citizens will be entitled to a 1mbps connection; within a few years that speed requirement will climb to 100mbps.</p>
<p>Perhaps predictably, I think this is great. Big government! Technology! Heedless disregard for cost or affected corporations! What's not to like?</p>
<p>Actually, though, the English-speaking press seems a little fuzzy on what exactly this announcement it means. It appears to be a guarantee of access, not a promise of internet service paid for by the state. It's also not quite as novel as it sounds: a French court <a class="reference external" href="http://technology.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/tech_and_web/article6478542.ece">declared net access a human right</a> earlier this year (though I believe that decision was expected to be quickly overturned).</p>
<p>But whatever the specifics, a lot of people will no doubt find the idea of enshrining network access as a right to be frivolous or silly. They shouldn't.</p>
<p>I think the temptation is to romanticize rights as timeless philosophical axioms; to connect them to an imagined state of nature from which your preferred understanding of the social contract then arises. It's no doubt difficult to admit technology into that picture. But what's the second amendment if not a guaranteed right to technology? &quot;Arms&quot; is, admittedly, a bit more poetically vague than &quot;100mbps broadband connection&quot;. But considering all the headaches that've been produced by that bit of American lyricism, it's hard to blame the Finns for being specific.</p>
<p>To me it seems simple: society needs to guarantee its members the ability to do certain things, like defend themselves and communicate and participate in the economy. If the march of progress makes it absolutely or practically impossible for them to do so without access to some enabling technology, then the ability to use that technology will have to be guaranteed, too, right?</p>
