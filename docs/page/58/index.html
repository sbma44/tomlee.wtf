<div class="line">Cyrus has <a class="reference external" href="http://cyrusfarivar.com/blog/?p=1164">a post linking to several articles profiling Borat's unwitting interview subjects</a>. I remember a bunch of these profiles coming out when Ali G got his big DVD-release PR push. Fake production companies, friendly assistants — just insist on meeting the on-air talent before the camera rolls and I think you can escape Mr. Baron-Cohen's traps.</div>
<div class="line">But, as you might imagine, the people who were duped aren't entirely happy. To their credit, few seem really outraged. But there is a recurring theme. From <a class="reference external" href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15175836/site/newsweek/">Newsweek</a>:</div>
</div>
<blockquote>
&quot;I was disappointed that Mr. Cohen never let me in on the joke,&quot; says Kathie Martin, who runs an etiquette school in Birmingham, Ala.</blockquote>
<p>From the <a class="reference external" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6071486.stm">BBC</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Washington DC public speaking coach Pat Haggerty also appears — and is seen trying to teach humour to Borat...</div>
<div class="line">&quot;About halfway through the session we took a break and I went up to one of the producers and said: 'This guy can't be real.</div>
<div class="line">&quot;'If you let me in on the gag, I will help you reach your goals because I don't care if you're from Kazakhstan, nobody is this crazy.'&quot;</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>From <a class="reference external" href="http://www.downtownexpress.com/de_179/howiwasduped.html">Linda Stein's firsthand account</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
Inspired segments of Borat and me were cut. At one point, Borat declared that men are stronger than women and held up two chairs to prove it. I did, too — although Iâ€™m only half his size</blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Last night, immediately before the Q&amp;A, John Hodgman forbade any questions that were wacky or funny. It didn't stop the middle-aged, slightly drunk government lawyers in the audience from defying their embarrassed wives' pleas and asking questions like, &quot;What is the meaning of life?&quot; But he was still right to try.</div>
<div class="line">What those interview subjects and assistant-counsels-in-charge-of-something-or-other don't understand is that guys like Hodgman and Baron-Cohen aren't looking for assistants. It would be nice if they were running a humorist fantasy camp where everyone could feel like part of the action, the same way that many NBA stars spend a few weeks each summer pretending that they enjoy playing games of Horse with aging corporate executives. But that's not what your ticket or selection as a interviewee gets you. To Hodgman, you're a customer. To Baron-Cohen, you're a prop. Just try to turn in a performance half as subtle and unselfconscious as that horse that falls down in the preview.</div>
<div class="line">Which brings me to the other thing about Borat: the exculpatory analyses of him are wishful thinking. Don't get me wrong — I think the character is hilarious, and by far the funniest of Baron-Cohen's creations. But the liberal-guilt-inspired line about Borat's humor being an attempt to lay our own prejudices bare? It's complete bullshit. Yes, &quot;<a class="reference external" href="http://onegoodmove.org/1gm/1gmarchive/2004/08/in_my_country_t_1.html">In My Country There Is Problem</a>&quot; showcases some entertainingly brazen country/western antisemitism. But most of Borat's interviews just show that Americans are patient, generous hosts. That isn't particularly funny.</div>
<div class="line">It's Borat himself that's funny, because he's a hilarious oaf. He looks foolish. He does dumb things. It's fun to laugh at him. But of course, this kind of humor has been employed in <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minstrel_show">awful ways</a> in the past.</div>
<div class="line">Now, the guilt-dodging excuse I favor is that Borat isn't actually parodying any specific ethnic or cultural group. He's a hodgepodge of stereotypes we have about eastern European otherness. He's certainly not a specific attempt to belittle the people of Kazakhstan (their <a class="reference external" href="http://www.avclub.com/content/node/53470">sadly defensive PR campaign</a> notwithstanding) — the only reason Borat hails from a specific country or speaks snippets of pidgin Polish is that he needs to interact with the outside world. These details convey some necessary authenticity; but they aren't meant to tie the character to any specific group of human beings. I don't really believe that Borat's antics are any more detestable than when Homer Simpson visited Crazy Vaclav's Place Of Cars (or blamed Tibor for his problems at work).</div>
<div class="line">But I may be fooling myself. I'd feel pretty uncomfortable watching a Borat segment with somebody from Kazakhstan, and that may be the real test. I won't be at all surprised if history judges the character harshly. I'm still going to see the movie, though. Because I'm a monster.</div>

<div class="line">I really, really love Halloween. It's clearly the best holiday ever, as Kriston ably explains <a class="reference external" href="http://grammarpolice.net/archives/000376.php">here</a>. But my track record of displaying my love for the occasion is mixed, and this year I'm being particularly lame. I haven't acquired any pumpkins, I haven't decided on a costume, and I certainly haven't summoned any unspeakable creatures of ancient evil from beyond the bounds of sane men's dreams. I'm dropping the ball.</div>
<div class="line">I've made my peace with this, though. I've more or less resigned myself to dealing with middle age by being the creepy guy who puts way too much effort into decorating his house each year, so it's okay if I run up a Halloween-related karmic debt right now. Besides, by the time next year's celebration rolls around I anticipate having learned how to make animatronic monsters (leaving only genuine necromancy remaining on my lifetime h'ween syllabus).</div>
<div class="line">But I don't want to let the date slip by entirely, so for now I'll just offer some Halloween-y media that I enjoy:</div>
</div>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.vice-recordings.com/halloween/">Do They Know It's Halloween?</a> I still love this song a stupid amount (be forewarned: there's sound on the page at that link). I sang its praises <a class="reference external" href="http://www.zunta.org/blog/archives/2005/10/27/rocktober_31st/">last year</a>, but my enthusiasm for the concept and execution hasn't dimmed. It stayed in my regular ipod rotation for an embarrassingly large amount of November '05, and it's wormed its way back in over the past few weeks.</li>
<li>Hellboy! I came across the pretty-good movie adaptation on TV last night, which naturally reminded me of the <a class="reference external" href="http://isohunt.com/torrents/?ihq=hellboy+right+hand+doom">totally awesome comic</a> (viewer applications: <a class="reference external" href="http://pixelcomic.deskmod.com/">currently-unavailable PC viewer</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.softpedia.com/get/Multimedia/Graphic/Graphic-Viewers/GonVisor.shtml">untested PC viewer</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://jomic.sourceforge.net/">okay Mac viewer</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.bitcartel.com/comicbooklover/">untested Mac viewer</a>). I soliloquized on Hellboy in a pretty tiring manner <a class="reference external" href="http://www.zunta.org/blog/archives/2004/04/12/the_aforementio/">a year and a half ago</a> — if you're curious to know the storyline, head there. If you just want to read a deeply creepy and well-realized horror pastiche, start that Bittorrent download posthaste.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.x-entertainment.com/articles/0690/">Garfield's Halloween Adventure</a>. Admittedly, I haven't actually seen this since I was a little kid, and anything associated with this franchise is generally pretty terrible. But it remains one of my most vivid Halloween memories. The internet disagrees with me, but I swear that when I saw this as a kid it contained a bunch of short animated pieces in addition to the main storyline. One of these centered on an orange cat — drawn in a completely different and generally more realistic style — escaping from an animal testing lab and being hunted down by scientists and dogs. In the final scene he escapes capture by involuntarily transforming into a dog — the result of the horrible testing he had undergone.
Okay, I might not be doing a good job of making it sound creepy as it seemed. But it scared the <em>hell</em> out of me when I first saw it. Now, sadly, the internet seems to have collectively forgotten this unusually grim chapter in the Garfield ouevre. Or maybe the sheer terror of it all just made everyone repress the memory. Anyway, this special was way better than Charlie Brown's annual Halloween apostasy. Great Pumpkin?! Screw that.</li>

                    <p>Yeah, okay, Kriston's pretty well <a class="reference external" href="http://grammarpolice.net/archives/001097.php">got my number</a>. I can't say that I'm too upset, though. I'm so used to getting grief over the Boy Scouts' admittedly inexcusable policies on homosexuality that having gentle fun poked at their new &quot;Respect Copyrights Activity Patch&quot; feels like a relief. Also, Kriston was kind enough not to excerpt this part of the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-scouts21oct21,0,6146565.story?coll=la-home-headlines">original article</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
The inspiration for the new badge came from Hong Kong, where the local Boy Scouts organization had its members pledge not to use or buy pirated materials. In addition, the Scouts agreed to search Internet file-sharing sites and turn in sites and users they see violating the law. The campaign was launched at a stadium before a slew of pop stars where the so-called &quot;youth ambassadors&quot; pledged to stem the rise piracy.</blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">So you're organizing rallies of youth devoted to turning undesirables over to the powers that be, eh? Sounds, uh, potentially problematic. Particularly since artifacts like <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitler_Youth_Knife">these knives</a> exist. (I actually own one — but hey, it was inherited! And originally purchased at a New Zealand flea market! And honestly, it's not evil in any easily-identifiable way, other than being the most deadly-looking object bearing the Boy Scout insignia that you can possibly imagine, which was the reason I kept it around.)</div>
<div class="line">I think it would behoove everybody to take a step back and remember that the Boy Scouts' weirdly militaristic structure works because it's designed to complement the impulses of little boys, who are, in most important respects, tiny fascists. It sounds bad, but it works out pretty well so long as the aggression is safely channeled down the command structure (and age brackets). Using those ugly impulses to further grown-ups' own martial fantasies turns really creepy really quickly, though.</div>
<div class="line">But I think it'll be alright: this is just an &quot;activity badge&quot;, after all — it carries far less metaphysical import than a real merit badge. In fact, I don't actually remember whether activity badges existed during my tenure in the Boy Scouts. They may be a recent invention of Big Badge, catering to the same mouth-breathing demographic that powers our nation's vanity licenseplate industry. I won't be a bit surprised if the coming months bring us both the &quot;threw brick through Strabucks window at ANSWER rally&quot; activity badge AND the &quot;strewed plastic mini-fetuses outside abortion clinic&quot; activity badge (it's called the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.thelongtail.com/">long tail</a>, people, and it's potentially mostly not imaginary).</div>
<div class="line">As long as the merit badge institution remains safely devoted to wholesome activities like <a class="reference external" href="http://www.brunchma.com/~acsumama/blog">rabbit-raising</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://ficke.blogspot.com/">philatelism SLASH numismatology</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.usscouts.org/mb/mb024.html">harnessing the fearsome power of the atom</a>, all is well with the world. And even if merit badges do become corrupted, there's still one last bastion of badge integrity that would have to be assailed before I lost my enthusiasm for the entire institution.</div>
<div class="line">You see, much like radioactive disasters, the very best badges were the ones that conferred new powers: Tote N' Chip let you play with knives, and the seldom-seen Fire N' Chip let you burn things (many troops, including my own, recognized boykind's innate right to play with fire and dispensed with the latter). I think there may have been a Torment The Fat Kid N' Chip badge as well, but I always missed the meetings where they were distributed.</div>
<div class="line">Merit badges, on the other hand, were simply a means of advancing in rank. Aside from the marksmanship badges, none carried the awesome destructive potential required to elicit any kind of enthusiasm from those earning them. Usually having one just meant that you had spent an uncomfortable half-hour talking to your friend's mom about Citizenship.</div>
<div class="line">So I think we'll be alright. Although if they start somehow incorporating DRM into swiss army knives (no whittling copyrighted works!), somebody's gonna have to die.</div>

<li><p class="first">Ed Castronova is the biggest name I know of when it comes to studying sociology in massively multiplayer online roleplaying games. Nevertheless, the MacArthur foundation <a class="reference external" href="http://news.com.com/2102-1043_3-6127294.html?tag=st.util.print">giving him $240,000</a> to build an Shakespeare-themed online world strikes me as a really, really bad idea. First, it's probably not enough money to make anything anyone would want to play. Second, it's <em>really</em> not enough money to deliver a game produced by people who aren't game designers and are going to make lots of project planning mistakes along the way. Third, players may not be keen to play a game that's just as concerned with using them as guinea pigs as it is with entertaining them. Fourth:</p>

<p>&quot;If you collect the 'To be or not be' speech and then take it to a lore master or to a skilled bard, he can then apply the magic to your broad sword or you (could) utilize the magic in a battle situation to give you this massive (advantage),&quot; Castronova explained. &quot;So there (will be) this intensive competition to get the best speeches of Shakespeare in your play book.&quot;</p>

Here's my shot at it: ads in games are nothing new, but it's only been in the last few years that they've become dynamic, able to be sold throughout the game's lifespan and downloaded to update players' machines. Now we face the prospect of that in-game advertising becoming more targeted, thanks to the game rifling through your hard drive, checking your browser history and work documents and musical taste. I would be extremely surprised if there was any law stopping this practice that game company lawyers couldn't get around with a creatively labyrinthine End User License Agreement. But maybe I'm just being pessimistic.</p>

<div class="line">Just seen on NBC Nightly News: a piece on the President's sliding popularity among Republicans featured a clip of Tim Russert asking Congressman Jim Talent, &quot;Do you believe that President Bush is a great president?&quot; His reply: &quot;Certainly he's going to end up better than Jimmy Carter, probably not better than Ronald Reagan.&quot;</div>
<div class="line">My <a class="reference external" href="http://www.zunta.org/blog/archives/2006/06/14/fame/">close personal friend</a> David Gregory then tried to spin this into proof of a lack of enthusiasm on the right for the commander in chief. But of course that's unreasonable. Remember the rule of thumb: whenever a conservative says &quot;Jimmy Carter&quot;, you can swap in &quot;Don Knotts&quot; (or possibly &quot;Bob Denver&quot;) without significantly altering the speaker's intent. The same trick works for &quot;Ronald Reagan&quot; and &quot;Jesus Christ&quot;.</div>

                    <p>Some of you might've seen <a class="reference external" href="http://www.dcist.com/archives/2006/10/17/frightening_fil.php">my post on DCist</a> yesterday about Count Gore De Vol, DC's hometown horror host. I have to confess that I wasn't aware of his existence until recently. Now that I do I'm an instant fan.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://isohunt.com/torrents/?ihq=uhf">Local broadcasting</a> sounds like a lot of fun — in one interview I read, Dick Dyszel, the man behind Count Gore, recounts the character's origins: the station needed a horror movie host, and he already had a lot of white pancake makeup on hand since he also helmed the channel's Bozo the Clown franchise. In addition to the makeup, he says he already had a cape lying around because &quot;it was the seventies&quot; (which I find mystifying and vaguely scandalous). Transylvanian accents are cheaper than either of those things, therefore: vampire.</p>
<p>But not only was I ignorant of the Count's existence, I didn't even realize that horror hosts were a national phenomenon. Of course I knew about <a class="reference external" href="http://www.elvira.com">Elvira</a>, Mistress of the Dark. But it turns out that her only real innovation was having enormous breasts. There are <a class="reference external" href="http://www.horrorhosts.com/">horror hosts</a> all over the country, presiding over plywood coffins and quietly helming late-night showings of abysmally bad scary movies. Some are <a class="reference external" href="http://www.creaturescape.com/HHH/sonofghoul/sonofghoul.htm">charming</a>, some are <a class="reference external" href="http://www.geocities.com/horrorhostunderground/html/hosts/119.htm">kind of sad</a> (yet apparently popular), and others look like they might be <a class="reference external" href="http://www.creaturescape.com/HHH/themortician/themortician.htm">legitimately spooky</a> (check out the guy's <a class="reference external" href="http://themortician.web.aplus.net/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderfiles/sitebreak.mpg">sample video</a>).</p>
<p>Even though he's no longer on the air, it's nice to know that Count Gore is ours — particularly since he seems to be among the most venerable and lighthearted of the horror hosts. And <a class="reference external" href="http://countgore.com/Dungeon.htm">his webpage</a> contains regular columns from a bunch of hosts from other parts of the country, which implies to me that there's a real sense of community among these guys. I like to imagine them all getting together for barbeques.</p>
<p>Anyway, I find it all pretty heartwarming. I'm still not ready to subscribe to Fangoria, though.</p>

                    <p>Once you publicly identify yourself as a geek, you start to hear a lot of ideas for internet projects from acquaintances. Anybody who's spent much time on the internet has at one time or another had an apparently monumentally great idea for a website that convinced them, for about half of an afternoon, that they were about to be rich. I'll refrain from reciting some of the more embarrassing ones I've heard, but they're frequently pretty bad.</p>
<p>There are three things working against you when you try to become a geek's idea man. First, the idea's probably terrible. No offense, it's just how these things go. Second, someone's almost certainly already done it, and folks generally don't bother doing any research before pitching it to a geek (who then has to figure out how to politely demur). Third, geeks have their own ideas for projects, and will usually find them more interesting and/or potentially profitable than third-party ones.</p>
<p>Hmm. This blog post is off to a strangely negative start. Well, nevermind all that. All I really wanted to say is that a while ago I had an idea to offer band-specific RSS feeds from Pollstar at a central site, letting folks track when their favorite bands were coming to town. I never got around to it, since it's not all that interesting an idea from a technical standpoint. But <a class="reference external" href="http://earfeeder.com/">look</a>! Somebody went ahead and did me one better, adding news and reviews and presales to the feed. Doing me <em>two</em> better, they programmed a Java applet that scans your hard drive to identify the bands you want on your watchlist.</p>
<p>Sadly, the Java thingy didn't work very well for me. I keep my music on my ipod and a server backup rather than my laptop hard drive, and I had to click the &quot;find more music&quot; link after the first round of searching to get it to look through the mp3s there. And once it started, it stalled out after 60some songs.</p>
<p>Still, it's a pretty nice idea, and if you keep your music on your hard drive it might really come in handy.</p>

                    <p>Remember <a class="reference external" href="http://www.aharef.info/static/htmlgraph/">this thing</a>? Pretty neat, I know. It made the interrounds back in <a class="reference external" href="http://del.icio.us/echoditto/dom">May</a> or so. Most people completely misinterpreted it, wrongly assuming that it tells you something about your site's relation to others. In fact, it tells you about your webpage's HTML structure. Not quite as exciting, unless you're a huge dork who gets a thrill out of his wondrously-parsimonious XML code.</p>
<p>But there <em>is</em> something fascinating about this project (aside from its value as eye candy, I mean). Check out the credits: <a class="reference external" href="http://www.processing.org">Processing</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~traer/physics/">Traer Physics</a>, and <a class="reference external" href="http://htmlparser.sourceforge.net/">HTML Parser</a>. Those last two aren't that interesting — the third is an HTML-parsing library, and the second is a physics library (although <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~traer/randomarboretum/">this</a> is kind of cool).</p>
<p>Door number one is where the action is. How have I missed this project for so long? Apparently Processing was designed as an educational tool, providing a quick visual payoff to new programmers. And it does that. But it also provides a quick visual payoff to people who aren't Java programmers, but would like to make something cool-looking and animated that works across platforms. People like me. Check out the fruits of some very brief labor:</p>
<div class="docutils container">
<applet code="sine_dots" archive="/2006/10/15/sine_dots.jar" <br></applet><p>width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; mayscript=&quot;true&quot;&gt;</p>
</p><p>To view this content, you need to install Java from <a class="reference external" href="http://java.com">java.com</a></p>
</applet></div>
<p>Sinusoidal dots may not be that exciting to you (although I do get significant enjoyment out of using the word &quot;sinusoidal&quot;). But the fact that those dots were made with a mere 67 lines of totally-unoptimized code should be — especially since more than half of those lines are variable declarations and stuff to read in configuration directives that could've just been hardcoded. Have a look <a class="reference external" href="http://processing.org/learning/examples/storinginput.html">here</a> to see just how much Processing can accomplish with very little code.</p>
<p>Still, crappy graphic demos can only get you so far. I wouldn't be nearly as excited about this if not for the <a class="reference external" href="http://processing.org/reference/libraries/index.html">collection of libraries</a> that are available for Processing — including an implementation of XML-RPC. So you could make one of these visualizations talk to Flickr, or Technorati, or Google, or del.icio.us, or a data source you programmed yourself. There's database, webcam, input and audio stuff, too (just for starters).</p>
<p>Anyway, more on this as I get a chance to play with it. And hopefully more on <a class="reference external" href="http://todbot.com/blog/spookyarduino/">how I found it</a>, too, which is a completely different (yet slightly related) and extremely cool tech platform in its own right.</p>

                    <p>But hey! Wonkette! That <a class="reference external" href="http://www.wonkette.com/politics/matthew-yglesias/blogger-dresses-funny-ends-up-on-facebook-206947.php">photo</a> isn't yours to use — <a class="reference external" href="http://flickr.com/photos/sbma44/57221879/in/set-1239224/">it's mine</a>. Two things: first, my normally creative-commons-loving self didn't put a friendly license on the photo, precisely because my friends might not appreciate photos of themselves looking silly being republished. Second, even if I <em>had</em> put a CC license on it, you'd still be obligated to provide attribution. It's just being polite.</p>
<p>But I don't think they meant any harm. Judging by the permalink, Wonkette picked it up from somebody's Facebook profile after they'd already purloined it — probably somebody I know and wouldn't begrudge the use of the photo. It's all pretty understandable, I guess.</p>
<p>I haven't talked to Matt about it yet, but I imagine it's not actually a big deal for him, either — he's posted far sillier-looking photos of himself to his own site in the past. Still, I can't say I'm incredibly pleased about the situation. But maybe that's just because I'm sore about Wonkette <a class="reference external" href="http://www.wonkette.com/politics/dcist/cries-of-protest-fall-on-deaf-ears-207238.php">picking on Martin</a> (unjustifiably!).</p>

An album of covers of They Might Be Giants songs? With The Wrens handling &quot;Birdhouse In Your Soul&quot;? That's something that both present- and 14-year-old-me would stand in line for (which would be fun in its own right: I'd have so much comic- and videogame-based wisdom to impart...).</p>
<p>Then the project got delayed. And then The Wrens weren't covering BIYS anymore. And then I sort of lost track of it. But the album insisted on being released anyway, emerging into the world in what would be a truly horrifying analogy if only I could think of how to come up with a metaphor for amniotic fluid that's &quot;Pitchforky&quot;.</p>
<p>Well, the CD is out as of July, but other than <a class="reference external" href="http://www.popmatters.com/pm/music/reviews/various-artists-hello-radio-the-songs-of-they-might-be-giants/">this PopMatters review</a> it doesn't seem to have attracted much attention. So, for the discriminating and/or cheap TMBG semi-completist, let me present some track-by-track impressions. An album of covers is a particularly good candidate for <a class="reference external" href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?id=160469951&amp;s=143441">an ala carte approach</a> — especially since some of these tracks are particularly bad.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt><strong>1. Self - Ana Ng</strong></dt>
<dd>What a miserable start. I hate to speak ill of the dead, but somebody clearly missed the point of this song in a profound way. &quot;Ana Ng&quot; is one of the most perfectly sad pop songs that I know. It's not a time for James Blunt vocals, precious production and intermittent assaults by fuzzed-out guitars. Boo.</dd>
<dt><strong>2. The Long Winters - Pet Name</strong></dt>
<dd>Much better. This song lies somewhere between Son Volt, Clem Snide and Ben Folds, landing in a pleasant alt-pop sort of space. The hooks are tinkered with just enough. You should probably buy it.</dd>
<dt><strong>3. David Miller - Narrow Your Eyes</strong></dt>
<dd>I should really recuse myself: this song contains handclaps. Put a few of those and/or some falsetto into a track and I'm pretty much guaranteed to like it. My opinion is worthless, enthusiastic though it may be.</dd>
<dt><strong>4. Charles Douglas - She's An Angel</strong></dt>
<dd>I'm not a huge fan of the original track. If you are, but wish it sounded like an increasingly-unconvincing Pavement cover, this might be right up your alley.</dd>
<dt><strong>5. Frank Black - Road Movie To Berlin</strong></dt>
<dd>Black Francis takes what I find to be a pretty godawful song and turns it into a totally-serviceable mumbly barroom dirge. It's the sort of essentially boring thing that white guys listen to in the last few years before they give up on rock and start obsessing over the blues. To be honest, I don't mind it at all. But then, I <em>do</em> have a birthday coming up.</dd>
<dt><strong>6. The Wrens - They'll Need A Crane</strong></dt>
<dd>Here's where it gets tricky. This is the band I got this album to hear. And while it's no &quot;Birdhouse In Your Soul&quot;, &quot;They'll Need A Crane&quot; is still a great song: superficially silly but with an underlying poignancy. And the band makes an ambitious choice from the start, moving the song's transformative centerpiece bridge to the very beginning of the song.
But then they don't follow through. Don't get me wrong — they give is a thorough Wrensification (or, more accurately, a complete <em>Meadowlands</em>ing). But it feels like they didn't want to waste too many good ideas on somebody else's song. Or maybe they only had a four-track recorder lying around. I donno. It's good, but it's not the revelation I was unreasonably hoping for.</dd>
<dt><strong>7. Steve Burns - Dead</strong></dt>
<dd>When you get down to it, the original version of this song doesn't have much going for it other than its weird and charmingly bouncy cadence. It turns out that slowing everything down, then throwing in harps and some half-hearted glitch-pop feints is a bad idea.</dd>
<dt><strong>8. OK GO - Letterbox</strong></dt>
<dd>It's pretty funny hearing a band this <a class="reference external" href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=NINJQ5LRh-0">treadmill-centric</a> try to sound so sinister. It's a total reimagining of the song, I'll give them that. But competing for cleverness points in a TMBG-themed milieu seems a little pointless.</dd>
<dt><strong>9. Recepter - Boat Of Car</strong></dt>
<dd>Good lord. Horribly lo-fi vocals combined with IDM noodling. It sounds like Thom Yorke is trapped under a stack of newspapers in his mother's garage.</dd>
<dt><strong>10. This Radiant Boy - Don't Let's Start</strong></dt>
<dd>Take a can't-miss pop song and add brattier <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Schneider">Fred Schneiderish</a> vocals and, yeah, it still won't miss. It's a shame that everyone sounds so bored, though. Those are the most listless guitars I've heard in a while. And, for the record, the breakdown is supposed to go &quot;deputy dog dog a ding dang depadepa / deputy dog dog a ding dang depadepa D&quot;. Thank you for your attention.</dd>
<dt><strong>11. Jason Trachtenburg - Doctor Worm</strong></dt>
<dd>You know those godawful neo-folk singers who infest the northeast? C'mon, you know who I mean: artists like Ellis Paul and Eddie From Ohio. The people who always sound like they're strummin' and singin' through a patronizin' grin while leaning over a newborn's crib? Well, that's what this sounds like. I don't know a lot about Jason Trachtenburg, but I'm guessing he's attained the level of fame he has through the gimmick that he and his wife have got going with their kid. <a class="reference external" href="http://www.firedoglake.com/2006/10/03/nrsc-uses-small-children-as-human-shields/">Good luck with that</a>.</dd>
<dt><strong>12. Fluid Ounces - It's Not My Birthday</strong></dt>

<dt><strong>13. Brett Kull - Another First Kiss</strong></dt>
<dd>I'm torn. On the one hand, this sounds like the Adult Contemporary mix of whatever it started out as. But it's pretty inoffensive, and I'm not familiar with the original recording. So I guess it comes down to the fact that this artist's name reminds me of the movie <a class="reference external" href="http://www.badmovies.org/movies/krull/">Krull</a>, which was totally awesome. Therefore: recommended.</dd>
<dt><strong>14. Hotel Lights - The End Of The Tour</strong></dt>
<dd>It's nice to end of a positive note. The original track was a lovely song that has the misfortunate of being recorded right as TMBG became a real band instead of just two dudes with synthesizers and an occasional kidnapped violin or horn player. It still turned out pretty well, but this version proves that it could've been better. Hotel Lights leave the basic structure of the song intact but swap new instruments in and out of the arrangement, then play through it with subtlety and grace. It's certainly not a reinvention of the song, but it's probably the best track on the album.</dd>
