                    <p><a class="reference external" href="http://uncov.com">The only tech blog that matters</a> shut down early this year, and after the traditional &quot;does the blogger really mean it?&quot; period I deleted the entry from my RSS reader.</p>
<p>But now, having just executed a botched subscription merge courtesy of the NetNewsWire iPhone app, Uncov has reappeared among my feeds. And, much to my surprise, it's got new entries! It looks like Ted started posting again in April. Persai, the project that he was working on, has recently launched as <a class="reference external" href="http://pressflip.com">PressFlip</a>, and consequently the content is more about the new venture and Java programming than about eviscerating idiotic startups — for now, anyway. Give it time. If you're feeling impatient, go read <a class="reference external" href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/07/14/dziuba_google_protocol_buffer/">Ted's Register column about Protocol Buffers</a> for some of that old flavor.</p>
<p>Curiously, <a class="reference external" href="http://uncov.com">uncov.com</a> redirects to <a class="reference external" href="http://pressflip.com">pressflip.com</a>. So the return of Uncov is... secret? Who knows, cares, or can be bothered to figure out the answer? The important thing is that the <a class="reference external" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/uncov">RSS feed is working</a>, so you should go resubscribe to that.</p>

<p>I'm surprised to hear myself say it, but after reading <a class="reference external" href="http://dcist.com/2008/07/23/novak_hits_pedestrian_its_not_joe_w.php">Martin's writeup</a> I feel a little bad for Bob Novak, who hit a pedestrian with his car this morning. It sounds like it was only a matter of time: the comments are just getting started, but so far about 10% are from people reporting incidents where Novak almost hit them, too.</p>
<p>But like I said, I feel bad for the guy. Bob and I go way back. When I was a little kid I used to watch the McLaughlin Group with my dad. I don't remember much from that experience besides McLaughlin's plaid Christmas jacket and the paternally-instilled lesson that Novak was a Very Bad Man. The situation became clearer during senior year of high school, when my government teacher would fulfill his educational duty by showing us taped episodes of <em>Crossfire</em>. It was an exciting time: Bill Press pioneered the disoriented, exasperated style of liberalism that would later help America ignore Al Gore; and the program itself was just beginning to metastasize into the odious force that Jon Stewart would eventually banish to another dimension. But the most remarkable spectacle was happening across the table from Press, where Robert Novak exuded pure reptilian malevolence with the sort of ease that made you want to stand up and applaud. When he tried to smile the entire class would physically recoil.</p>
<p>But now, looking back, I realize that Novakian evil isn't anything to fear. I didn't know it at the time, but the McLaughlin Groupies who should have been inspiring bone-chilling terror were Fred Barnes and Mort Kondracke. They were the true harbingers, the types of guys whose ilk might lobby for offshore drilling on the strength of an invitation to an oil magnate's daughter's super sweet sixteen; or who might accidentally launch missiles while trying to play Snood, then refuse to feel bad about it.</p>
<p>So what if Novak outs the occasional CIA agent or runs down the occasional pedestrian? His is a totally comprehensible evil. And, for what it's worth, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.radaronline.com/features/2008/07/hated_pundits_chris_matthews_keith_olbermann_bill_oreilly_an_4.php">this Radar feature</a> indicates that he's a perfectly nice old man, who delights staffers at every office holiday party with jigs played upon his famous golden fiddle.</p>
<p>My point is that Washington knows how to deal with his type: when we've had a few too many missing pedestrians and/or wars, the town's bravest men descend into the secret Masonic catacombs below and, confronting the beast with hemlock and holy water, force him to dissolve into shrieks and a foul, sulfurous mist. At this point the Washington Times prints a note indicating that Mr. Novak will be on vacation until the next solstice, and everyone declares themselves more or less satisfied.</p>
<p>That's the way things work around here, and it's a system we're comfortable with. Seeing misfortune befall ol' Bob seems like an imbalance, and that makes me sad. If I get my choice of foe I'll take reptilian evil over reptile-sized brains any day.</p>

                    <p>Alright internet, I need theories. We have a problem at work: it's our dishwasher. It's a relatively recent acquisition — one of those miniature units that feel dainty and ridiculous, but which are quite useful for taming the tower of coffee mugs and soiled tupperware that would otherwise teeter over the sink. For that, it's great.</p>
<p>The problem is that it smells. Not while operating, but when its wash cycle is complete, everything inside of it is suffused with a sickening floral scent. Not <em>really</em> floral, mind you — I mean bad fake floral, and with a distinct note of machine oil underneath it. It's pretty unpleasant. I've had to throw out more than one serving of food after forgetting to re-rinse the container I put it in. I once found my eyes watering from it as I tried to eat a mug full of oatmeal.</p>
<p>I thought it was the fancy-pants detergent capsules we were using, but after switching brands that suspect has been ruled out. The smell persists.</p>
<p>So here's the mystery: what the hell could it be? And how do I get rid of it?</p>
<p>Oh, and a dead body was found next to the dishwasher in a puddle of water BUT THE ROOM WAS LOCKED. But I don't think that's necessarily related.</p>

                    <p>It turns out that I'm not a very good gambler. I've already learned this during my still-brief career as a blackjack player — once at Foxwood's, again in New Orleans. In between those trips Atlantic City had neglected to reinforce the lesson, but yesterday it corrected the oversight. Ficke and I had driven there after an idyllic beach weekend — the girls, seemingly blind to the sophisticated glamour of AC, opted to head directly home in the other car. I should've known my luck was bad after five-putting during our pre-departure round of mini-golf. At the time I'd simply chalked it up to the robot spider guarding the hole, but now I see that my problem was more metaphysical.</p>
<p>It was hardly a catastrophe*, but the fumbling, vacant dealers did collect our money with startling speed despite spending most of their time staring hopelessly into the space over our heads. That was the worst part: seeing so many good cards wasted on those for whom they could produce no joy. I would've thought that the place's delightful wild-west theme would keep the employees more cheerful. Maybe for them the mild disappointment Matt and I felt at the lack of period costumes has grown into a poisonous cancer that eats them away from the inside. I bet it's nothing that some leather fringe and a fake gunfight scheduled on the quarter-hour couldn't cure.</p>
<p>* Thanks in part to the casinos' exorbitant ATM fees. Am I crazy to think this is a bad decision on their part? Cutting down that $4.50 charge seems likely to make them a hell of a lot more money over the long run.</p>

<p>Interesting: the author of the HackMii blog has <a class="reference external" href="http://hackmii.com/2008/07/dear-nintendo/">posted an entry</a> requesting that Nintendo get in touch with him about an exploit he's discovered that would allow piracy of Wii games without modification to the console. He notes that he's tried emailing Nintendo but hasn't received a response. Then he indicates that he's planning to follow the disclosure methodology outlined <a class="reference external" href="http://www.wiretrip.net/rfp/policy.html">here</a>. Key parts:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">A. [...T]he ORIGINATOR is to email the MAINTAINER about the problem.</div>
<div class="line">B. The MAINTAINER has 5 work days respond. [...] The ORIGINATOR is technically free to do whatever they want to do after 5 work days—however, they should be fair and wait if the MAINTAINER shows adequate initiative to fix the ISSUE.</div>
<div class="line">[C, D, E and F concern the procedure followed if the MAINTAINER acknowledges the communication and works to resolve the issue]</div>
<div class="line">G. If the MAINTAINER feels it's appropriate to alert the public of the issue, then there's no reason why the ORIGINATOR should not. Traditionally, alerting the community of a problem (but not providing full exploit details) has proven to be futile; other researchers are then just as likely to discover the problem as well—and they may not bide by the guidelines set by this policy. Therefore, if the issue is to be disclosed, all aspects of it should be disclosed.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>In short, if Nintendo chooses not to respond, there may be piracy-enabling exploit code for the Wii published in as little as five days. This is a real possibility: Nintendo's historical reaction to issues raised by the hacking community has been to ignore it and hope it goes away. There don't appear to be nearly as many institutional resources devoted to mitigating these issues as at Sony and Microsoft — that's apparent from their consoles' relatively simple security systems, the slow and somewhat half-assed manner in which the Twilight Hack was ultimately patched, and the lack of attention paid to piracy on their handheld consoles relative to, say, the PSP's constantly-updated firmware.</p>
<p>A lack of attention shouldn't be confused with a lack of calculation, however: Nintendo might be right to ignore these issues. The Wii's success owes to its adoption among a new demographic — one that's not traditionally associated with gaming, and one that can probably be counted on not to do much damage to Nintendo's bottom line by burning patched ISOs from the Pirate Bay.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Nintendo has responded through private channels, and consequently it looks like the exploit won't be released until after a patch is issued. It's still entertaining to check out the comments at the linked post, though, which are full of morons impersonating Nintendo representatives in order to get the exploit sent to them. A hint for these overconfident confidence men: most major corporations don't ask to use IRC to discuss trade secrets.</p>

<p>But it's awfully nice that they're not. I'm not sure when it happened, exactly — the frenzy of the Iota show and the vastness of Fort Reno may have concealed the exact moment — but <a class="reference external" href="http://thecityveins.com/blog/2008/07/16/were-gonna-make-it-after-all/">last night at the Black Cat</a> it was clear that the City Veins' live show has passed a new threshhold. God <em>damn</em> but they killed it. Maybe it's just Stockholm Syndrome; if it is, I'm prepared to embrace it.</p>
<p>Watching them play, I couldn't help feeling a pang of envy: it's tough to see such wholehearted commitment to the moment without wanting more of it for yourself. Fortunately it was easy to drown that wistfulness in joy, and pride, at watching your friends throw themselves so completely into something they clearly love.</p>
<p>It looks like it's easy now, like the songs have been worked and reworked until they're so pliable that they can be twisted into whatever shape the band imagines during the count-off. I'm sure that's just an illusion. But it's a convincing one, and a testament to how good these guys have gotten at playing together.</p>

                    <p>WashCycle has a <a class="reference external" href="http://washcycle.typepad.com/home/2008/07/the-myth-of-the.html">good post</a> on scofflaw cyclists and the outsized anger directed at them by pedestrians and drivers. It's worth <a class="reference external" href="http://washcycle.typepad.com/home/2008/07/the-myth-of-the.html">reading the whole thing</a>, but here's a bit about jaybiking:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">[A] better question is &quot;why don't drivers 'jaydrive'?&quot;</div>
<div class="line">Is it because they love the law so much? Did you skip the previous section?</div>
<div class="line">It's because their risk/reward calculation is coming up with a different answer. And that makes sense. In a car you're several feet farther back from the intersection and you're often a foot or two lower, meaning you can't see as well (I bet those on recumbents don't jaybike as often as those on standard bikes). In a car you're in a soundproof enclosure so you have no stereoscopic hearing. And if you make a mistake you aren't as maneuverable as you are on a bike or on your feet. You can't just ditch to the sidewalk. Driver's don't jaydrive because, in their own estimation, they can't. But if they could, I'm sure they would.</div>
<div class="line">Still, that doesn't explain the anger. Drivers get — I feel — irrationally angry about this. After wondering why for so long, an anthropologist friend of mine helped me to understand. Running a red light is so dangerous for cars that it isn't just illegal, it's taboo. You're breaking a social construct. Which means people find it objectionable and abhorrent. So if education is needed, maybe it's needed to explain why it's safer for cyclists to do this than for drivers.</div>
<div class="line">[...]</div>
<div class="line">The way to end jaybiking violations is to decriminalize them. [...] Idaho has changed its law — and California is considering it — to allow cyclist to treat stop signs as yield signs and stop lights as stop signs.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>I agree with all of this, although it doesn't really apply to me any more: over the past few months I've become a very, very good citizen cyclist.</p>
<p>It's not that I think patiently waiting for a red light to change is making me or anyone else safer — it's just that I can't stand the thought that I might provide grist for those who whine about bicyclists' lawlessness. Besides, the instinctive anger that drivers feel upon seeing a bicyclist is no doubt that much more intense when they can't put their fingers on a handy excuse for why the biker's presence infuriates them.</p>
<p>My traffic safety habits are now entirely spite-based.</p>

                    <p>First: the plan to move DC's intercity buses to the L'Enfant wasteland is on hold. I got the following in an email on Friday:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">The District Department of Transportation as of July 3, 2008 has suspended the new intercity bus permit regulations to allow for additional evaluation and review of the program. Originally intended to begin in early July, the regulation seeks to better manage the use of public space and institute curbside management practices through new permitting requirements and by identifying specific locations for passenger drop off and pickup. [...]</div>
<div class="line">Further details will be available as DDOT continues to evaluate the new policy.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Hilariously, the email's author appears to have simply cc'ed everybody who wrote in about the issue. It looks like they got about 400 complaints.</p>
<p>On Friday Kriston and Matt tried to convince me that the whole bus terminal project was a sinister plot to legislate Greyhound's competition out of existence, delivering yet another crooked victory to Big Bus. Key to this undertaking, they said, was a little-noticed but crucially important new rule forbidding the bus companies from selling tickets at curbside. Instead the companies must maintain a storefront — a requirement that, given the lack of available real estate at the new depot site, could not be met. Presto: no more intercity buses.</p>
<p>I was dubious, and after reading the text of the (now tabled) proposal, I'm even more so. Here, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ddot.dc.gov/ddot/lib/ddot/information/publicspace/emergencyrule.pdf">have a look yourself</a>. Section 3307.8:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">An intercity bus operator shall not:</div>
<div class="line">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;Vend tickets in the public space;</div>
<div class="line">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;Arrive sooner than thirty (30) minutes prior to scheduled departure in the intercity bus zone;</div>
<div class="line">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;Remain in the intercity bus zone for more than thirty (30) minutes after arrival; or</div>
<div class="line">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;Allow intercity bus passengers to obstruct the flow of pedestrian traffic in the public space and into adjacent buildings.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Obviously the curbside ticket-sale question would have hinged on what &quot;public space&quot; means. I am not a [etc.], but 3307.8(d) strongly implies to me that the interior of the bus isn't considered a part of the public space — certainly it's legally distinct in at least <em>some</em> ways, since the bus operators can charge admission to and eject people from it. And of course many of the intercity bus companies sell their tickets at the pickup site, but do so as their representative moves through the loaded bus checking tickets. Sometimes you pay as you get on, sometimes you pay once you're seated. I can't imagine mandating one or the other would dramatically disrupt these businesses' operations.</p>
<p>Besides which, the proposal sidesteps more obvious ways to inconvenience Greyhound's competitors. Fines for noncompliance are only $200 or $300 (depending on whether it's a first offense); the fee for renting space for loading and unloading works out to less than $2.50/hr. This isn't to say that moving these buses to L'Enfant is a good idea, but I don't think it's a conspiracy, either.</p>

Obviously larger animals take more time to reach full size, wasting more energy on metabolic upkeep. But equally obviously there's a certain amount of overhead associated with being a mammal that may not scale constantly with the total amount of food that the animal provides. Consider the relationship between volume and surface area — same idea.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the pig is generally considered the smartest animal in the barnyard. So if you're looking for a reason to be uneasy about pork consumption, there you go: if you suspect that sentience works on a sliding scale, and if you believe that the moral outrageousness of a given act of violence against an animal is weighted by the animal's level of consciousness, then your pig-slaughter is far more ethically objectionable than ordering a serving of chicken tenders. This strikes me as a much better source of liberal guilt than the difference in carbon footprint between types of meat.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p><a class="reference external" href="http://grammarpolice.net">Kriston</a> sent me <a class="reference external" href="http://www.economist.com/displayStory.cfm?source=hptextfeature&amp;story_id=11699909">this link</a> earlier this week, which discusses using water to cool our ever-hotter computer processors. It's an interesting read, particularly the part about using waste heat from datacenters for cogenerative heating.</p>
<p>But the ins and outs of the CPU heat problem are actually even moreinteresting than the article implies. So interesting, in fact, that I think I'll blather on about them for a bit.</p>
<p>First: this isn't a new problem. As we cram more transistors onto chips every electrical component gets smaller and noisier, and we have to crank the voltage up to be able to hear the signal. That produces more heat. As we increase processor clock speeds the heat-generating operation of all those tiny switches happens more frequently, too, which also produces more heat.</p>
<p>This is a pretty well-known problem in hobbyist circles, where overclocking — running your CPU at a faster speed than it's designed for — is a popular way to eke out more bang per buck. Doing so also produces a lot of extra heat, which these days translates into the CPU shutting itself down rather dramatically once it reaches the danger zone (earlier chips dealt with overheating in considerably more expensive ways).</p>
<p>In overclocking circles exotic cooling solutions are pretty common, whether in the form of beefed up fans, Peltier coolers or water. A normal CPU cools itself with a fan that uses air to wick heat away from a radiator-like block of aluminum, which is strapped tightly to the CPU with just a tiny smear of thermally conductive grease between 'em. But air is much less efficient at transmitting heat than the same volume of liquid, so if you're pushing the envelope it may make sense to shuttle energy around with liquid.</p>
<p>This isn't a particularly exotic technology any more — Dell was <a class="reference external" href="http://www.hothardware.com/articles/Dell_XPS_710_H2C_Performance_Gaming_System/">shipping water-cooled gaming systems over a year ago</a>. But it's still unlikely to enter the mainstream. As you might imagine, the potential for disastrous failure is much higher than with a fan. And there are other inconveniences — if you don't use the right chemicals you might find your PC clogged with algae.</p>
<p>An amusing alternative exists: use a nonconductive fluid and simply submerge the whole system. Like, say, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/strip-fans,1203.html">cooking oil</a>. Dump your PC's guts in a tub, cover with oil and overclock away! As you might imagine, there are some downsides. First, atmospheric water may foul the oil and perhaps even collect in small patches sufficient to cause a short. Second, anything with moving parts — hard drives, for example — will need to be kept safely unsubmerged. Third, various compounds in your machine's electronics, like cable insulation, may slowly dissolve in a nonpolar solvent like oil. Fourth, you'll still need to circulate the oil if you want it to properly exchange heat. Fifth, and most importantly: it's going to be really messy and gross. Seriously, don't pour oil on your PC.</p>
<p>But there are other technologies being used to mitigate heat problems. One of them — admittedly, kind of a boring one — is the general trend toward multiprocessor computing. This is being undertaken primarily for other reasons, but a pleasant consequence of greater parallelism will be an ability to avoid some heat problems.</p>
<p>A somewhat more speculative (but still plausible) idea is to escape silicon and its heat limits by finding another semiconductor substrate material. Diamond is the one most often bandied about, as <a class="reference external" href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.09/diamond_pr.html">in this Wired article</a>. It's a pretty neat idea, although so far as I know nobody's yet trying to build such a processor outside of a research lab.</p>
<p>The coolest, most semi-magical solution to the heat problem is <a class="reference external" href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2003/11/14/reversible_computing_is_the_only/">reversible computing</a>. I can't claim to be an expert, but the basic idea goes like this: if you keep track of every step of a computational process in such a way that, after arriving at your answer, you can run them all <em>backward</em>, the final result will be a much less entropically disordered state than a traditional processor would have arrived at. A result is that much less of your input energy is converted into heat.</p>
<p>I know: it sounds kind of ridiculous, as though we're expecting our mathematical doodlings to bend reality in a completely implausible way. There must be some obscured practical gotcha hiding beneath the theory, ready to spoil our cool-computing aims in the same way that every magnet-based free energy machine fails to live up to its imagined performance. But the idea's been around for decades, and not in fringe circles. It's just that it's a sufficiently advanced technology, indistinguishable from... well, you know.</p>

But the iPhone 2 experience is not for me. It's the price: I could be wrong, but my understanding is that, as a current iPhone owner who's already sold AT&amp;T his soul, I'd be paying <a class="reference external" href="http://www.tuaw.com/2008/07/08/why-you-shouldnt-buy-the-iphone-3g-on-friday/">$400 more</a> than the advertised, subsidized price. That's too much for 3G and a GPS receiver that's apparently incapable of TomTom-style realtime tracking.</p>
<p>In fact, I'm not even upgrading to the iPhone 2 software — not yet, anyway. I'd love to have a blogging client and NetNewsWire (which would sync my unread items). But I'm not quite ready to abandon my jailbroken apps. <a class="reference external" href="http://www.iphonehacks.com/2008/04/twitter-twinkle.html">Twinkle</a>'s a great Twitter client already — I don't need Twitterific. <a class="reference external" href="http://justanotheriphoneblog.com/wordpress/2008/04/19/lexitron-new-text-twist-like-game-for-iphone/">Lexitron</a> is a fantastic game, and certainly more appealing to me than Monkey Ball.
