                    <p>Non-surprise!: dental insurance remains a complete and utter scam. I'm still waiting on the follow-up phone call, but some mail I got over the weekend has made me think that, for the second time in six months, my dental insurer has decided they aren't responsible for paying for more than a thousand dollars' worth of work that, before the procedure, my dentist assured me they would.</p>
<p>Last time it was because they only pay for dental technologies that are no longer in use — trepanning, internally-administered quicksilver, that sort of thing. This time the procedure was safely archaic — no joke, my molar is now filled with a <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gutta_percha">tree sap discovered in 1842</a> — so I suspect that instead they'll say they're off the hook because I was switching jobs. In fact I was <em>doubly covered</em> for much of the period in question, with two — two! — separate insurance providers supposedly responsible for the care and upkeep of my mouth. There was no point at which I did not have dental coverage. I was awash in dental coverage! And yet...</p>
<p>It turns out that while an individual dental procedure occupies an infinite amount of time when viewed through the lens of subjective experience, when the perspective is shifted to the realm of paperwork even vast swaths of appointments suddenly collapse into single instantaneous points, which are located such that entropy/out-of-pocket-expenses are maximized.</p>
<p>Anyway it's all quite fascinating in a mathematical and ontological sense, but at the same time it's also really goddamn irritating.</p>

                    <p>I've been watching the SoapBlox saga, and its coverage, with morbid fascination — my interest and the vehemence of my reaction to it all are probably a sign of the increasingly provincial nature of my expertise, I suppose, and that's a little depressing. But still, I feel compelled to point out that most of the reaction to it is idiotic.</p>
<p>Here's the story: DailyKos runs on a system called Scoop. It's kind of a monstrosity, but large swaths of the netroots are used to it, terrified of change, and have consequently convinced themselves that the system they started using first happens to be technically superior to all the ones they encountered thereafter. This isn't a novel delusion by any means; most of us do it all the time, myself included.</p>
<p>One developer decided there were some things he didn't like about Scoop and elected to rewrite it in a different language. You can find the project announcement <a class="reference external" href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2005/3/27/61120/4863">here</a>, and it should immediately set off warning bells:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">There's no indication that he's envisioning his efforts as an open source project.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">He clearly hasn't bothered to learn much about Scoop, given that he misidentifies the language it's written in as PHP rather than Perl. If he'd opened a single source file, he could not have made this mistake.</p>
</li>
<li><div class="first line-block">
<div class="line">He said this:</div>
</div>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">I am not a language snob. I know all languages have their place. And I see php as the language for a small to medium sized operation. Java is an Enterprise solution and a complete, robust language, capable of interacting with just about anything computer.</div>
<div class="line">If we want to take blogs to the next level, we have to take our blogging software to the next level.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">This is the kind of meaningless bullshit that salespeople say when they know nothing about anything except that they have something written in Java that they'd like to sell. Java's great, it's fine, but PHP powers sites like Digg and Facebook, so don't tell me it can't run your blog about Rhode Island politics. Perl, can, too — obviously it powers dKos and other Scoop sites, but it also manages to keep Slashdot afloat. It's not the loveliest language around, and aside from Scoop and Movable Type, web development has pretty much moved on to faster and/or cleaner languages. But it can clearly get the job done.</div>
<div class="line">Also: &quot;capable of interacting with just about anything computer&quot;? What does that even mean?</div>
</div>
</li>
<li><p class="first">His email address is <em>pacified69&#64;yahoo.com</em>. Come on.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite this, the sorry state of Scoop hosting and the netroot throngs in its thrall seem to have been enough to push jScoop to some success as a proprietary host for political communities. The hosted effort was branded as SoapBlox, it acquired a few machines, and it charged reasonable rates. Then it got hacked.</p>
<p>I haven't seen the code; it's not open source. And it's been years since I wrote any Java, so I might not be able to make heads or tails of it even if I did see it. But my guess is that the author didn't just reinvent the wheel in terms of Scoop, but also in terms of forms processing, sanitizing input, session handling and who knows what else. Some vulnerability was left exposed, and someone took advantage of it.</p>
<p>Hey, we all make mistakes. Bugs happen. But it's our responsibility to make sure that our mistakes happen in places that are unlikely to lead to catastrophic problems. That means building on other people's work. Googling for existing projects and reading old mailing list archives is less fun than firing up TextMate and starting to type, but you've just gotta grit your teeth and do it.</p>
<p>One of SoapBlox's servers went offline, and the dev abruptly declared defeat. The users were understandably freaked out. Unfortunately, that's leading them to make some bad judgments. Here, from a Kos diary entitled &quot;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2009/1/7/121323/7371/193/681191">Why SoapBlox Matters</a>&quot;:</p>
<blockquote>
SoapBlox includes all the major features of a community blog -- namely, user diaries and other community-building features. These features are NOT readily available in any other software platform WordPress, MoveableType and others make it exceedingly difficult to do things like diaries and frontpage promotions, and SoapBlox makes it easy.</blockquote>
<p>This just isn't true. There are plenty of projects that can match the requirements of SoapBlox's users. I've used Drupal a lot, and can say with confidence that it offers the diary, threaded-commenting, rating, voting and front-page-promotion features that seem to be at the heart of Scoop. And hey, <a class="reference external" href="http://scoop.kuro5hin.org/comments/2006/6/1/41757/36255/9#9">this guy seems to like it</a>. SoapBlox doesn't matter because of its software; it matters because of the bloggers and diarists that use it. Writing blog software is much, much easier than running a successful online political community. There's plenty of software out there, and the SoapBlox community ought to set its priorities accordingly.</p>
<p>Right now parts of the netroots are rallying around SoapBlox, trying to get it back online in a sustainable way. This speaks well of them, but it's a mistake. This one-off of a project should never have been trusted with anything worth saving. Who knows what other exploits lurk in its codebase? Or what business problems might take it offline in the future? You can say that opensourcing the project will help resolve these problems, but that's only true if you can also find developer manpower willing to continue reinventing this particular wheel. Frankly, you're not going to find high-quality talent that's willing to donate its time to a cause this pointless.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.techpresident.com/blog/entry/33526/soapblox_burnout_points_to_vulnerability_in_left_s_infrastructure">TechPresident suggests another path</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
Options now for SoapBlox include [...] wrapping the platform into the services offered by one of the bigger progressive tech firms like Blue State Digital, EchoDitto, or Advomatic.</blockquote>
<p>Speaking as a someone who until recently worked at EchoDitto, and whose boss is now one of Blue State's founders, this is also a stupid idea. If one of these firms wants to do this work for free, then sure, the SoapBlox bloggers should jump at the chance. But hiring a consultancy is an option that's vastly more expensive than what's needed by these sites — sites which are, frankly, not particularly sophisticated from a technical or design perspective.</p>
<p>Here's what I would suggest. First, make sure the SoapBlox admin is content to keep the sites up, at least temporarily. Second, find a college-age technical wunderkind who's interested in politics and willing to work for cheap. These guys are a dime a dozen — I used to be one myself. Third, convince him to write an exporter for the SoapBlox data that puts it in a standardized format. Hooking into <a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/p/google-blog-converters-appengine/">this project</a> (found via <a class="reference external" href="http://del.icio.us/al3x">al3x</a>) might not be a bad idea. Getting the data into a portable form is the priority.</p>
<p>Then, find someone at a consultancy like one of the aforementioned ones who's willing to help you figure out your requirements and specifications for a new suite of software. The simplest, best option is probably to just run Scoop. It's what you want anyway; might as well stop nosing around it. I'm not intimately familiar with Scoop, but a quick look at its installation procedure makes it look like the complexity of installing and running it has been vastly overstated. If you don't do that (or just want to help get the netroots off Scoop — a noble cause), then I'd suggest a hard look at Drupal and maybe Wordpress MU, or maybe Slashcode if for some reason you want to head toward Perl-land. You may have to get someone to develop a custom module or two to make the solution maximally Scoop-y, and you'll certainly need someone who knows their way around the system to help configure it.</p>
<p>But given where the aesthetic bar has been set, this is not a particularly tough problem, and it shouldn't cost that much money. If this community can afford to send people to Netroots Nation or the DNC, it can surely afford a minor investment in its critical infrastructure. Oh, and one more thing: when users inevitably raise a hue and a cry because the order of links on the sidebar has changed, or because they have to reconfirm their email address, or because of some other stupid thing, you should ignore them. They just want attention. Learning new systems and habits is a pain, but not nearly so painful as continuing to limp along in a system that never should have been used in the first place.</p>

                    <p>We live in a pretty Jehovah's-Witness-heavy neighborhood, but I mostly don't mind. Sure, it means the occasional well-meaning pair of Sunday visitors will find me groggily staring at them, potentially shirtless. But that's mostly their problem — I'm perfectly happy to see them. Besides, you never know when you'll find yourself wishing you had a few dozen copies of <em>The Watchtower</em> on hand.</p>
<p>The best side effect, though, are the hand-addressed notes I get in the mail, which contain handwritten notes, which contain printed tracts, and all of which contain numerous spelling and grammatical errors. Still, they're preferable to the ones I used to find placed under my windshield wipers back when I had the car with <a class="reference external" href="http://flickr.com/photos/sbma44/89423228/in/set-72057594051841686/">the awful front-end damage</a>; those would encourage me to seek help for my alcoholism (lucky guesses don't count!).</p>
<p>Anyway, here's the latest one I've received. In most respects it's pretty unremarkable, but does make a case for Bible study that I don't remember encountering before: that it will protect you from <em>zombies and/or ghosts</em>. Possibly also draculas; I'm not sure, it's been a while since Sunday School.</p>

                    <p>Look, I don't know what <a class="reference external" href="http://pygmalioninablanket.blogspot.com/2009/01/guess-whos-back-to-work-thats-right-you.html">you</a> <a class="reference external" href="http://blogstretch.blogspot.com/">guys</a> have against Vince or <a class="reference external" href="https://www.shamwow.com/ver4/index.asp">ShamWow</a>, the revolutionary new absorption concept that is sweeping — well, if not the nation, then at least the parts of it that watch TBS at 1am. But this mean-spiritedness has got to stop. Yes, it's clear that Vince had been awake for at least 50 hours when that commercial was filmed. And yes, he is an <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vince_Offer">ex-Scientologist who sued Anna Nicole Smith for breach of contract</a> in relation to his failed gross-out comedy movie (the New York Times called it &quot;<a class="reference external" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9805EFDF1F31F93BA15756C0A96F958260&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=underground+comedy+movie&amp;st=nyt">a monument to ineptitude and self-delusion</a>&quot;).</p>
<p>But what's the alternative? This is a subject that Charles, Emily and I have discussed at length. Vince may not be perfect — he's just a human being, as flawed and beautiful as any of us — but at least he has the guts to stand up to Billy Mays and the grasping tentacles of his infomercial syndicate.</p>
<p>Now, I'll be the first to acknowledge Mr. Mays' impressive achievements. But his time has passed; it's clear that these days, his heart's not in it. Worse, his <a class="reference external" href="http://www.asseenontvvideo.com/487/Zorbeez.html">Zorbeez project</a> is a transparent attempt to destroy Vince and the ShamWow, no matter the cost (how else can one explain his proffer of a $60 value for a mere $14.99?!). Doesn't America deserve a fresh new face to sell us oddly-shaped cooking implements and citrus-based cleaning products? Can we really sanction the sort of anticompetitive behavior that Mr. Mays represents?</p>
<p>I say yes! And no! Respectively! Vince may not deserve your love, but when, every night, his shaking hands remove that headset — in that moment he at least deserves your respect. And your order, of course. Call now.</p>

                    <p>Having spent the last week or so attending to less demanding electronic devices — the Xbox, the DS and the iPhone chief among them — I'm now hopelessly late with this post. But I still find the intersection of technology and advertising to be very interesting, and hope you'll bear with me even if the holidays have played havoc with the bloggy news cycle.</p>
<p>As soon as I read myself described as &quot;<a class="reference external" href="http://techliberation.com/2008/12/23/15130/">always-interesting</a>&quot; I had a feeling that Tim <a class="reference external" href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20081223/1359303208.shtml">might not wholeheartedly agree</a> with <a class="reference external" href="/2008/12/23/news-you-can-lose/">my predictions about the fate of the advertising industry</a>. That's perfectly understandable: I am, at heart, a crackpot — one who's taken the institution of advertising as a personal affront since he was sixteen or so. I've mellowed a bit since then, but it's fair to say that my perspective on the matter is abnormal. I still feel motivated to explain it, though, so let me take a crack at it.</p>
<p>Before that, there's <a class="reference external" href="http://www.jeffnye.org">Jeff</a>'s in-comments query to respond to. I think that answering it may provide some useful context:</p>
<blockquote>
Could you maybe elaborate on your claim that &quot;It's easy to forget how quickly advertising has evolved...&quot;, because I just don't see it. TV ads today are pretty similar to TV ads 50 years ago, and print ads look a lot like they did 100 years ago. The technology has improved, but the fundamentals seem pretty similar. Aside from a few horrible attempts at viral advertising in recent years and college bowl sponsorship, what's really changed?</blockquote>
<p>I should clarify: the old forms aren't wholly supplanted by the new. You're less likely to see a 100-word black and white full-page testimonial for a product in <em>Life</em> magazine than in days past, of course. But in general the old techniques persist in one way or another: the billboard; the artless car commercial; the couple yammering on the radio about something or other. Variants of these have and seem likely to continue to remain with us.</p>
<p>But novelty goes a long way toward making an impression, because it's interesting and can conceal the mercenary underpinnings of the message. Jeff mentions viral marketing as a relatively recent innovation, and I think it's a great example. There are plenty of others, though: product placement in sitcoms. Infomercials. Scientific papers paid for with industry grants. Some types of service journalism. Exclusivity agreements between college sports teams and apparel manufacturers. There have, and will continue to be, innovations in the field of product-selling, even if they aren't always self-evident.</p>
<p>But novelty necessarily comes with an expiration date, so it's an endless battle. We have continually-evolving defenses that let us tune these distractions out. A decade ago I might not have noticed the subtly-placed Aquafina bottle in the medical examiner's office in <em>The Spirit</em>; now, trained by decades of carefully turned-toward-the-camera product labels on network sitcoms, I couldn't help but see it. Although I'm sure that its presence still made some small, brand-reinforcing impression, it's a minute one compared to the success that this technique must have first enjoyed. And, in this case, it was coupled with a healthy dose of resentment at Aquafina for its commercial intrusion into entertainment I'd already paid for.</p>
<p>I think advertising serves basically two functions, which I will, in a grossly unfair act of framing, refer to as its <em>informative</em> and <em>manipulative</em> aspects. First, there's the informational side: educating consumers about products and services that they might be interested in purchasing, but about which they might remain ignorant if intervention isn't pursued. That's pretty straightforward, I think. Not every worthwhile commercial service is interesting enough to prompt unsubsidized media coverage, so informing interested parties of these services' availability is a useful function that advertising can provide. A listing for a plumber in the yellow pages fits this description pretty well.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there are the manipulative aspects of advertising. These aren't necessarily <em>bad</em> — they may compel behavior that's desirable from one standpoint or another — but they're essentially cynical attempts to affect consumers' decisions on the basis of criteria other than the fundamental value of the good or service being purchased and its utility to the consumer (in the absence of the commercial message). Coca-cola's Santa ads are a decent example: they really have nothing to do with the soda's quality, and are therefore basically an attempt to distort the market for it by using unrelated appeals.</p>
<p>Most ads reflect both of these aspects to some extent, of course. And I don't mean to imply that this is the only way to classify advertising. But I think it's a useful way to approach it, so bear with me for a moment.</p>
<p>This brings us to Tim's response to my assertion that the advertising industry is likely to shrink:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Digital media allows advertisers to be a lot more specific about the users they want to target and to collect a lot more data about their effectiveness. Tom suggests that this is a bad thing because once companies discover their ads aren't working well, they'll stop spending money on them. But the flip side is that advertisers can measure when a particular ad is working, and that ad inventory becomes correspondingly more valuable. Even better, better measurement means that the average ad should improve over time. Ads that don't work can get dropped more quickly, and the ones that perform well can be put on heavy rotation, emulated by other advertisers, and so forth. That can only be good for ad revenues.</div>
<div class="line">Tom also suggests that advertising is doomed because the Internet makes it a lot easier to avoid it. But peoples' hatred for advertising isn't inevitable. It's a consequence of the limitations of 20th century media technologies that required advertisers to adopt &quot;scattershot&quot; approaches to advertising. There was no way to target car ads at the 5 percent of the population that's in the market for a car at any given time, so the other 95 percent of us had to sit through endless car commercials. But online there are lots of ways to more narrowly target ads at people who are likely to be interested in them. In the long run, as we've said before, advertisers are going to have to realize that content is advertising. If you can make ads relevant, interesting, or entertaining, people aren't going to try as hard to avoid them. Search engines do this by only showing ads relevant to the particular keyword a user entered. Other advertisers have figured out that if they make their commercials fun to watch, people will be more willing to watch them. Of course, it's hard to predict whether the total amount of advertising revenue will go up or down over the next decade. But as long as people buy stuff, companies will be willing to spend significant amounts of money to influence their decisions.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>I think Tim is seriously overstating advertisers' enthusiasm for being non-annoying — it's not as if they've only now figured out that people don't like being intruded upon in irritating ways, and are resolving to turn over a new leaf. My understanding is that the efficacy and reported consumer enjoyment of an ad are inversely correlated. Much better to make an infuriating jingle that will force the consumer to mentally recite the word <a class="reference external" href="/2007/11/25/give-a-give-a-give-a-garmin/">&quot;Garmin&quot; ad infinitum</a> than to, say, cast Tina Fey in a funny credit card commercial for... uh... Amex? Or was it Mastercard? Anyway the ending with the fire extinguisher was funny.</p>
<p>But I agree with Tim, too: I think that the localization functionality he refers to will indeed continue to evolve, and I'm sure it will be a boon. But it's hard for me to believe that it will really be the savior of the ad industry. Anecdotally, it seems like online ads already target me pretty well, yet almost never earn my clicks. More generally, the role Tim is describing is entirely within the benevolent, information-providing aspect of advertising that I outlined above. But this is also the most straightforwardly-doomed aspect of the industry. It's now much easier to get more and better information about products and services than it used to be; from Yelp to Amazon reviews to the simple act of searching Google, the utility of deliberately-placed informational advertisements has been seriously diminished. We should consequently expect that aspect of the industry to shrink. If people want information about a product, they can get it. That pretty much leaves the narrow case wherein the consumer has a material need, yet doesn't <em>know</em> what they want before being told how to get it. But it seems to me that the industry is pinning a huge amount of hope on this relatively minor class of purchases.</p>
<p>To me, this whole argument sounds eerily similar to the one that maintained that the MP3 revolution would ultimately benefit the recording industry because of all the promotional power provided by giving people free access to music. There's something to this, but the positive effects will almost certainly not be enough to reverse the contraction of a now-unnecessary industry. In a very broad sense, information has gotten much cheaper, and all information vendors should therefore expect the size of their markets to shrink. That includes advertisers hoping to &quot;educate&quot; the public about the availability of their clients' products.</p>
<p>That leaves the burden of making money to the manipulative aspect of advertising. And I admit, this is more open to debate. But I really do think that when you and I tell ourselves we can filter out commercial appeals, it's not <em>entirely</em> self-flattery. Sure, we're subtly affected by that billboard or radio spot or iPod commercial. But we're less affected than we were the first time, and far less affected than would be someone who hadn't grown up in an ad-saturated environment. Sure, ads can still warp our opinions. But we're being constantly trained to ignore them. And I stand by my basic contention that advertising's set of novel permutations is limited in a way that will ultimately let the consumer gain ground on the manipulations leveled against her. To return to the <a class="reference external" href="/2008/12/23/news-you-can-lose/">last post</a>'s metaphor, we consumers are like increasingly antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria. Perhaps the ad industry will develop a miraculous new class of techniques. If not, I think that the importance of that sort of artificial intervention into our natural — and by and large perfectly-adequate — system will continue to decline.</p>
<p>So yeah, I still think that ads will continue to get less effective. The informational function they serve is vastly less relevant in the internet age; the opinion-manipulating function of the industry is a never-ending struggle, but one that, with each passing season, has fewer novel weapons at its disposal. In the face of those facts, how can the industry do anything but contract?</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>Hi there! Christmas obligations have ceased, and we're on to the &quot;lying around&quot; phase of the holidays (my favorite part). The Christmas celebrations themselves... well, they went pretty well. I got a tent! Also a Nintendo DS, and a ton of candy, and <em>who knows</em> what delights from Emily (we're still slowly exchanging presents, but I've already gotten a copy of <em>Dune</em> from her, which is pretty awesome).</p>
<p>Exchanging presents with my family was awfully pleasant, too, as was the Grays' Christmas party (now with heated tent!) and having a chance to see old friends. Really, there's only one constituency that inexplicably dropped the ball in its Christmas celebrations: the Jews.</p>
<p>Well, alright, they didn't fall so far short. Black Cat Christmas Eve was <a class="reference external" href="/2006/12/25/christmas-eve-in-the-drunk-tank/">unacceptably cheerful</a>, but that's hardly their fault. It was the Christmas movie-watching where the true outrage occurred. Yes, Spencer and Matt joined me to watch <em>The Spirit</em>. But was there subsequent Chinese food to be had? No! They were too full from their preceding visit <em>to a Christmas party</em> to get noodles. For shame, gentlemen. That is not what Jewish Christmas is all about.</p>
<p>Spencer made amends a few days later, though (Matt had left for New York), as we discussed <em>Valkyrie</em> and my flailing bok choy accidentally sent broth spattering all over the restaurant. So I don't think I'll have to report anybody to their childhood rabbi just yet.</p>
<p>Actually, it turns out that I've seen a ton of movies over this break:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>The Spirit:</strong> Pretty bad, and not in a good way.</li>
<li><strong>Valkyrie:</strong> Not bad! But (SPOILER ALERT) it turns out the good guys lose in the end.</li>
<li><strong>No Country For Old Men:</strong> Remains awesome.</li>
<li><strong>Gilda:</strong> Sommer tells me that this is Rita Hayworth's most famous role, and I guess it's the one featured in <em>The Shawshank Redemption</em>. The plot concerns the titular character, who's kind of cruel sociopath, but less so than the two men who form the other points of the movie's love triangle, one of whom owns a cane-sword. Everybody is constantly smoking and being mean and answering questions with questions, which conveys an air of sophistication, apparently. And it all happens against the exotic backdrop of an illegal casino in Buenos Aires, possibly, and the intrigue and excitement that necessarily surround an illicit tungsten cartel. Frankly, that was my biggest complain with the movie: there wasn't nearly enough in it about tungsten. It's a <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tungsten">fascinating element</a>! Anyway, I'm not sure that this was a good movie, exactly, but it was fun to watch, and available to stream from Netflix. Drink every time someone says &quot;Johnny&quot;.</li>
<li><strong>Die Hard 2:</strong> A perennially-underrated (by me) entry in the <em>Die Hard</em> franchise. It's actually pretty good! But it's also now bittersweet, thanks to the failed Fred Thompson candidacy. He's an even better pretend airport administrator than he is a pretend district attorney! It's hard to watch it and avoid thinking about what a fine pretend commander in chief he would've made.</li>
</ul>
<p>Only one other disjointed Christmas occurrence to share: the cleaning of my dad's basement, which comprised his major Christmas gift from his children. A quarter-century of water-damaged crap lay in wait. There were childhood treasures to rescue, dead rats to locate, and huge amounts of toxic dust to inhale. It took some professional help, but we did it. Here's the truck — it isn't yet full in this picture, but it was brimming by the time we called it a day.</p>

                    <p>It has to be said: Black Cat Christmas Eve has fallen off in a pretty serious way. I just got back from it, and yeah, I had a nice time. My friends were there, and beer was there, and unexpected friendly acquaintances were there, and it was pretty good. But the atmosphere was terrible. This was, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.zunta.org/blog/archives/2006/01/02/personal_failur/">I think</a>, the fourth installment of this tradition, but right now I'm worried that we may have to find a new venue for the fifth.</p>
<p>Here's what Black Cat Christmas Eve is supposed to be. First: the only open bar in town. Second: filled with put-upon Jews and self-pitying Christians. Third: silent, except for paid-for instances of &quot;Fairytale of New York&quot; played via the jukebox. Fourth: characterized by furtive smoking — or, if legislation precludes smoking, plenty of uncomfortable introspective pauses.</p>
<p>STRONGLY CONTRAINDICATED: DJs, crowds, and merriment — yet all were in abundance tonight. Extraneous DJ aside, it was like any other night in the Red Room. This probably sounds like it shouldn't be a problem — after all, I like the Red Room! But it felt wrong. I enjoy this tradition because of the atmosphere and the carefully-cultivated and variably-meta sense of self-pity that it fosters. Having a bunch of drunk Irish guys making boisterous toasts undercuts that decisively.</p>
<p>But I suppose I can't really complain. Having a good time while being surrounded by people enjoying themselves is a strange thing to bitch about. It's just that this is the one night every year that I have set aside <em>specifically</em> for the romanticization of lonesomeness. I feel like that's not too much to ask.</p>
<p>Of course, it always comes back to that goddamn Pogues song — that's the whole premise. And if you want an illustration of what the Red Room Christmas Eve is supposed to be versus what it presently is, all you have to do is listen to the original version back-to-back with Stars' horrible cover:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><a class="reference external" href="/2008/12/25/christmas_eve_in_the_drunk_tan_1/The%20Pogues%20-%20Fairytale%20of%20New%20York.mp3">The Pogues – Fairytale of New York</a></div>
<div class="line"><a class="reference external" href="/2008/12/25/christmas_eve_in_the_drunk_tan_1/Stars%20-%20Fairytale%20of%20New%20York.mp3">Stars – Fairytale of New York</a></div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>A BIT TANGENTIAL:</strong> Having just listened to it (after being forced to listen to uptempo non-Pogues songs at the Cat), I feel compelled to point out that <em>by far</em> the most (and arguably only) devastating couplet in &quot;Fairytale of New York&quot; is &quot;I could have been someone / well so could anyone&quot;. The rest is mostly melodrama, to be honest. Still, that's a hell of a sentiment.</p>
<p><strong>ALSO:</strong> Make fun all you want, but Sufjan really brings it when it comes to Christmas music. &quot;<a class="reference external" href="http://hypem.com/search/what%20child%20is%20this%20anyway/1/">What Child Is This Anyway</a>&quot; may be irony-free, but it's also pretty awesome.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>For the last week or so, I've had <a class="reference external" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matthewyglesias/~3/485937058/news_without_the_paper.php">this post of Matt's</a> flagged in my RSS reader, waiting for a response. In it, he castigates the advertising market for failing to competently embrace the web. Today the conversation continues: <a class="reference external" href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/ezraklein_archive?month=12&amp;year=2008&amp;base_name=there_is_nothing_anyone_can_do">Ezra responds</a> to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.boingboing.net/2008/12/08/the-newspaper-indust.html">Clay Shirky</a>, and says that, contrary to what Shirky implies, the newspaper's death became inevitable the instant digital technology was invented. Matt <a class="reference external" href="http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/archives/2008/12/what_might_have_been_6.php">responds</a>, noting, among other things, that newspaper brands will survive (which seems right — if <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/18/magazine/18rebranding-t.html?ref=magazine">Nuprin can do it</a>, so can the New York Times), and that the papers' failure to hang on to their classifieds business was a major mistake. I think that brings us up to date (whew!).</p>
<p>I'm with Ezra on this one, and apologize for the amount of overlap that this post will likely have with his own. But I think Matt is seriously understating the crisis facing the advertising industry. Narrowly, there's the question of Craigslist. It's a weird one, in that its creators have quite obviously avoided implementing features that would maximize revenue, or even just reported user satisfaction. They could have a slick-looking site, and a huge staff, and a big office in the Mission with polished concrete floors and free snacks in the break room. But they've decided not to, and that's their genius: they realized that classifieds were going to be a race to the bottom, so they decided to get to the bottom first. This is a crucial realization — one that a lot of people involved in similar races just can't accept.</p>
<p>I don't think Matt's right that this could have been stopped, but it probably could have been slowed. Competing on the basis of having fewer features rarely works, and it probably wouldn't have for Craigslist, either, had the newspapers rolled out competent online options quickly. CL was allowed to build marketshare in an unusual and, in hindsight, inexcusable way. Also, we haven't collectively reached that proverbial bottom, making CL's success seem that much stranger. But we'll get there; if the papers had responded quickly, we just would've gotten there at a more languid pace.</p>
<p>But classifieds aren't the only doomed form of advertising. I think there are reasons to doubt advertising's viability in a broader sense, too. More of it will inevitably have to be done online as people continue to spend more of their time on the net, but so far that hasn't been working out very well. For one thing, there are technological ways to avoid online advertising. For another, although various form factors have been tried, the online medium still hasn't been figured out how to capture viewers' attention in the way that print and broadcast have — personally, I think the media may simply be innately immune to commoditization, thanks to the aforementioned ability of computers to avoid displaying unwanted information. Third, and probably most troublingly for the industry, online advertisers seem to have made a serious mistake when they offered concrete metrics to their customers. This action was perfectly understandable — the web makes it simple to collect objective data, and it's easy to see why an advertising client might find the prospect of better stats alluring. The problem is that doing this reveals that advertising <em>just doesn't work very well</em>.</p>
<p>In retrospect, it should be obvious: to whatever extent the advertising industry <em>is</em> capable of shaping the public's sense of how to gauge value, naturally they will apply that talent to their own products first. The other advertising media smartly developed captive metrics agencies like Nielsen and Arbitron. But online advertising charlatanism is still in its infancy, and continues to be dominated by primitively objective concepts like &quot;page views&quot;, &quot;click throughs&quot; and &quot;purchases&quot;.</p>
<p>Right now the practitioners of online advertising have not yet succeeded in artificially inflating the perceived value of their product in the way that advertisers working in other media have. Perhaps this will change. I think it might not. It's easy to forget how quickly advertising has evolved, and how quickly the public has evolved along with it. Although I admit that it's probably an overly antagonistic framing, I tend to think of the relationship between the public and advertising as being analogous to the one that exists between humans and bacterial pathogens. In both cases the pace of evolution is staggering, but I'm left optimistic that humanity will come out on top.</p>
<p>For one thing, we're awfully plucky. For another, there are fewer constraints on us. As viewers of advertising, we're subject to various hindrances that seem to be biologically determined — among others, we're susceptible to the concept of brands, and we're keen to see sexy dames, and plenty of em (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.oldmansimpson.com/index.php?page=details&amp;episode=2F02">so to speak</a>). But we're free to come up with whatever compensatory intellectual constructs we need to help us maintain our senses of iconoclasm and connoisseurship, and our ability to maximize the value we receive for our money. Advertisers face many more restrictions: time, space, cost, reproducibility, risk aversion, various regulations, and, last but by no means least, the simple necessity of crafting messages that are both interesting and at least somewhat coherent from a commercial perspective.</p>
<p>I admit it: I've always been an advertising millenarianist. But I still feel a bit bad for them. None of this is to say that advertising will ever go away, but as the pool of novel advertising techniques shrinks and purchasers become more aware of its limited utility, the industry will naturally contract. And that brings us back to newspapers.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/ezraklein_archive?month=12&amp;year=2008&amp;base_name=there_is_nothing_anyone_can_do">Ezra lays it out pretty well</a>; let me do the same with a tedious half-analogy. Once upon a time the cost of distributing information was high. Then technology improved, and if you were able to make a big up-front investment, economies of scale allowed you to drastically lower the cost of getting data out. If you sold information-distribution services at a price in between the old one and your own, newly-discovered cost, you could make a lot of money. Firms flourished, and added premium features to differentiate themselves from their competitors, just like those little sticks of gum that come with baseball cards. The paid information distribution business continued to be lucrative — to get more lucrative, even! — to the point where the quality of the gum could be drastically upgraded. Sometimes even non-gum ingredients were bought up and converted into gum (it just seemed like the most efficient way to distribute them, frankly — look how much gum people were buying!).</p>
<p>But technology kept getting better, and that up-front investment kept getting smaller, and although by now everyone had pretty well fooled themselves into thinking it was the high-quality gum that moved units, that wasn't actually the case. In fact, a lot of that gum was downright revolting<sup>1</sup>.</p>
<p>These days distributing information costs very little, and there's no minimum order. And people still chew gum, but not nearly so much of it. Hopefully the quality of gum available to them is better than it was, but I think the jury's still out on that one.</p>
<p><strong>ALSO:</strong> I hadn't read <a class="reference external" href="http://techliberation.com/2008/12/23/the-news-innovators-dilemma/">Tim's post</a> before I wrote this, but he makes a number of excellent points. One thing that's maybe worth adding: when he says &quot;...the only way to avoid this grim fate is to spin off an independent subsidiary that can pursue new markets without worrying about fat profit margins or cannibalization of existing product lines... Iâ€™m not aware of any high-profile newspaper firms that attempted this&quot;, I think the Washington Post may be a counterexample — the Post and their online operations are entirely distinct, and separated by a river. Typically they're castigated for this decision, and to be fair I'm not sure to what extent the decision (which is now being undone) was made with Christensen's principles in mind versus more immediate concerns (there wasn't any more space in their downtown building). Either way, I don't think WaPo.com was sufficiently independent to really embody Christensen's model (as I understand it based on Tim's account — I haven't read the man's work), but it's the closest noteworthy example I'm aware of. Doubtless there were other, truly-independent ventures backed by major news organizations, which are now lost to memory thanks to &quot;making money on the internet&quot; being a very tough proposition in general.</p>

                    <p>Prompted by <a class="reference external" href="http://www.unfogged.com/archives/week_2008_12_21.html#009485">Stanley</a>, it's suddenly occurred to me that this is the last day that many of you will spend at your desks, staring at your computer screens. That means it's also the last good opportunity to capture your attention with Christmas MP3s. I haven't got anything original to offer, but it never hurts to re-share some personal favorites:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><a class="reference external" href="/2008/12/23/christmas_music/The%20Pogues%20-%20Fairytale%20of%20New%20York.mp3">The Pogues – Fairytale of New York</a></div>

</div>
</blockquote>
<p>I suppose I'm willing to admit debate regarding the Frightened Rabbit song — I'm a big fan of it, and typically find myself listening to it for months after the holiday season. I even like the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Christmas-Well-Stop-Choir-Version/dp/B000ZN0KKW/ref=sr_f2_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=dmusic&amp;qid=1230048972&amp;sr=102-2">all-choral b-side version</a>, and have gone so far as to buy the new 2008 version from iTunes (which, thanks to some ludicrous overproduction, isn't nearly good as the version linked here). But it's a newcomer, and so I'm willing to accept dissenting opinions.</p>
<p>The same can't be said for &quot;Fairytale of New York&quot;, which is pretty clearly the greatest Christmas pop song of all time. Temporary waivers allowing dissenting opinions may be granted for &quot;So This Is Christmas&quot;, I suppose, but only if you're feeling too depressed and dissolute to listen to the Pogues — which, unless you're presently stumbling through the trash-strewn streets, cold, alone and wearing a Santa beard caked with sick, you're probably not.</p>

<p>Kriston was nice enough to invite me along to the UMD iron pour. If you get a chance to attend a similar gathering, I strongly recommend that you do. It was bitterly cold, so we didn't exactly linger. But the sulfurous stink of burning coal, the sight of underqualified undergrads poking at the fiery slag hole, and the general atmosphere of nervous excitement all combined to satisfyingly deadly effect.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>Let's talk about Metro's recent decision to eschew Google Transit. This is a topic about which I have a small amount of inside knowledge, actually. At the end of August I wrote to WMATA's CTO, Suzanne Peck. I talked about some of the projects I'd done with WMATA data and expressed my affection for the agency. I explained that I was frustrated by the limits of the data available on wmata.com, and I requested a meeting. I received a response almost immediately (even though it was 11pm or so — a good sign in a CTO!). She thanked me for my interest, complimented me on my projects and directed me to Victor Grimes, her deputy, whom she instructed to meet with me.</p>
<p>I met with Mr. Grimes a week or two later. He was cordial but not too interested in what I had to say about opening up WMATA's data: according to him, the situation was well in hand. WMATA was already on its way to integrating with Google Transit. There were just a few lingering problems.</p>
<p>To discuss those properly, we first need to talk briefly about Google Transit. The heart of Google's system is their <a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/transit/spec/transit_feed_specification.html">GTFS format</a> — this stands for Google Transit Feed Specification, and it's quickly become an industry standard. It's not too complicated: basically a GTFS feed consists of a bunch of comma-delimited files with names like &quot;routes.txt&quot; and &quot;stops.txt&quot;, which all get zipped up into one file and placed on the transit agency's website. You could open these up in Excel if you wanted. Google sucks this data down once a week or so, processes it and displays it within their own systems — but a transit agency doesn't have to worry about all that. They just need to make sure they get their GTFS file right, and that Google knows where to find it. Many other systems have adopted GTFS, and a lot of them make the data <a class="reference external" href="http://www.bart.gov/schedules/developers/open.aspx">available to the public</a>, not just to Google.</p>
<p>The frequency with which Google picks up the GTFS data was an issue, according to Mr. Grimes. Google wanted to do it about once a week; that wouldn't cut it for Metro, he said. WMATA updates its data daily with bus detours, route changes and the like. It sounded like this had been worked out, though, and Google would simply arrange to pull the data every day.</p>
<p>The second objection involved the display of fare information. Google Transit couldn't manage this, apparently. The format does <a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/transit/spec/transit_feed_specification.html#fare_rules_txt___Field_Definitions">make allowances</a> for transferring fare information, but for whatever reason it wasn't up to the task of handling WMATA fares. That was fine, though; users could just be directed to the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.wmata.com/rider_tools/tripplanner/tripplanner_form_solo.cfm">RideGuide</a> website if they wanted to know fare information.</p>
<p>The final hurdle was bureaucratic. The various jurisdictions that make up Metro had to sign off on the release of the (already public) data. Last I heard, Maryland was the holdup. But Mr. Grimes thought this would be resolved soon. The GTFS dataset and Google Transit functionality would be released around September 23, he said.</p>
<p>Well, that didn't happen. I gave it a week, then wrote to ask what had happened. Here's the last I've heard, received on October 10:</p>
<blockquote>
Anyway, the Google/WMATA transit integration project has come to a stand still for reasons I can't explain, but I expect things to get back on track in the near future. We are having a meeting to discuss our participation in the Google transit initiative next week and I'll let you know how that turns out.</blockquote>
<p>Presumably that meeting didn't go very well. <a class="reference external" href="http://www.welovedc.com/2008/12/16/wmata-says-no-to-google-transit/">We Love DC spots WMATA's explanation</a> — it comes in the form of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.wmata.com/about_metro/news/faqs/preview.cfm?faqID=54">a FAQ page</a> put online yesterday, seemingly in effort to control the fallout surrounding their decision to ditch Google. Here's the meat of it:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Google could not guarantee accurate and up-to-date Metro trip information and could not provide Metro fare information. Metro's own Web site provides near real-time travel and fare information to viewers.</li>
<li>Many transit providers in the region are not part of Google Transit so Google's Web site viewers could not get a complete and accurate picture of their transit travel options in the Washington Metropolitan area when they use Google Transit. Metro has partnered with all the local transit providers in the Washington region to provide up-to-date and accurate information for Metro's Trip Planner. The Trip Planner factors in other area bus and rail providers, such as Fairfax Connector, DASH, ART and Ride On, and their schedules and fare information when giving customers travel options.</li>
<li>Metro and Google have not yet come to acceptable terms regarding licensing agreements, which put Metro at a greater legal liability. Google is a for-profit company while Metro is a taxpayer subsidized public agency. Google wanted Metro's transit data at no cost and wanted the transit agency to open itself up to greater legal liability. Given financial constraints, Metro officials are exploring whether there is a way for the transit agency to generate revenue in such a partnership.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>I think we can safely dismiss the second point — hearing about the ART bus might be nice, but it's hardly a sufficient reason for scrapping this project. Based on my conversation with Mr. Grimes, I also think point one is probably a red herring. Those limitations were known in August, and they weren't considered show-stoppers then. I suppose Google may have ultimately decided that they couldn't support a daily GTFS update, but this seems very unlikely to me — the Metro system is big, this technical problem is small, and enough people would find this integration useful that I'm sure they'd find a way to support it. I suppose point one could also be interpreted to mean that WMATA was insisting on some sort of service level/data accuracy guarantee that Google couldn't or wouldn't provide, but insisting on such a point seems a bit unreasonable.</p>
<p>So that leaves us with point three, which basically boils down to: Google needs to cough up some dough. I'm actually a bit more sympathetic to this idea than you might expect. &quot;Google Transit Feed Specification&quot; sure <em>sounds</em> like a proprietary format. It's easy to imagine a bureaucrat with sign-off powers seeing that and saying, &quot;Wait a minute. We're doing all this work for a private enterprise and they're not even paying us for it?&quot; Google is an awfully helpful company, but presumably it's offering transit information because it makes them money (or at least supports their brand). WMATA's in perpetual need of cash; there's no reason it should be giving Google freebies.</p>
<p>But this misses the larger point. GTFS may be unfortunately eponymous, but it's an open format. Exposing schedule data in useful ways should be part of WMATA's mandate — the current system of bulky PDFs used for bus schedules is downright inexcusable. I don't particularly care whether WMATA lets private firms like Google use its data for commercial ends, but it should certainly grant noncommercial rights to the public.</p>
<p><strong>THIS JUST IN:</strong> More from Mr. Grimes:</p>
<blockquote>
Yes, there is still an issue between WMATA and Google regarding the licensing agreement. However, we are in continuing discussions with Google and looking at other options for making the data available in GTFS format not only to Google but to others who have requested the information. You are correct in that much consideration has been given to this effort and it is not over. I will let you know as soon as a decision has been made regarding the direction WMATA will take to provide the transit data in GTFS format.</blockquote>
<p>Also, <a class="reference external" href="http://dcist.com/2008/12/16/google_transit_here_come_the_excuse.php">via DCist</a> the Examiner <a class="reference external" href="http://www.dcexaminer.com/local/Metro_involvement_with_Google_Transit_held_up_by_the_details.html">confirms</a> that this is really about money. Well, good. WMATA should put the GTFS dataset online under a Creative Commons noncommercial license, and Google should cough up the $68k of online ad revenue that WMATA's afraid of losing. Lord knows they've got the money.</p>
<p><strong>FURTHER:</strong> One of Ezra's commenters <a class="reference external" href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/ezraklein_archive?month=12&amp;year=2008&amp;base_name=google_and_the_dc_metro#comment-6243029">points out</a> that Google Transit isn't actually all that great. I'm not that familiar with it, but I'm not too surprised — it's a hard problem. But even if Google can't do it, someone else can.</p>
<p>Also: it's worth mentioning that the real payoff here is for buses. Figuring out how to ride the train is dead simple; the bus, not so much. Right now it's easy for people to read the PDF bus schedules, but hard for them to figure out what the schedule means (or which schedule is the correct one); these difficulties are reversed for computers. If WMATA releases the GTFS dataset, riding the bus could become much easier for a lot of people.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>I was going to write a post complaining about 2008's crop of music, but after reviewing a few more year end lists in addition to the first two that prompted my ire (Rolling Stone, NPR) it's clear that I was just listening to the wrong things.</p>
<p>It's not entirely my fault — people were getting excited about some pretty boring stuff. I wasted a lot of time on new acts that focused on nostalgic sounds, folksiness or acoustic arrangements. That's fine — the world needs a way to fill its Starbucks compilation CDs, after all. But I'm only interested in that stuff in small doses, and this year offered a surplus that was so vast as to be off-putting: Bon Iver, The Dodos, She &amp; Him, The Ting Tings, Vampire Weekend and Fleet Foxes were inescapable. It would be naive to pretend that bands can or should avoid being informed by the past, but many of these acts wore their influences (e.g. Paul Simon, the guy who invented reverb) on their sleeves a bit too prominently for my taste. And the rest were just flat-out wussy. I prefer music that makes me feel young, especially now that I'm not anymore.</p>
<p>Other, more established acts released albums that were pretty okay, but less than mindblowing. The Hold Steady treaded water entertainingly; Mates of State inched forward rather than blasting upward; Wolf Parade finally reemerged but failed to match their debut; and Kanye made a great album that no one would be calling great if it were by, say, Imogen Heap. Also the Killers, Death Cab and Coldplay all released albums that I'm told are pretty good, but which I'm content to ignore until their component tracks show up in Rock Band.</p>
<p>There were two albums that both made it to my iPod and seemed to actually possess some vitality: the ones from Girl Talk and Lil Wayne. Not coincidentally, both underscored how doomed the old recording industry system is. On the one hand you've got Gregg Gillis, whose work is fresh, engaging, and commercially unreleasable thanks to our intellectual property regime. On the other you've got an album that frankly seems just okay*, but which was seized upon in order to anoint a deserving new talent who'd done his reputation-making work on mixtapes and other artists' releases — although admittedly a huge commercial success, Tha Carter III was a rallying point as much as it was a collection of songs.</p>
<p>Anyway, I've now got a formidable list of 2008 albums to acquire: Titus Andronicus, Frightened Rabbit, TV On The Radio, Deerhunter, the Walkmen (sorry <a class="reference external" href="http://blogstretch.blogspot.com">Amanda</a>) and Gaslight Anthem (sorry <a class="reference external" href="http://attackerman.firedoglake.com">Spencer</a>). That's a lot of music to get through before the new year, but I'm optimistic that the exercise will leave me feeling cheerier about 2008 and the musical downturn that'll inevitably be brought on by the coming Democratic administration (less suffering means worse art, or so the theory goes).</p>
<p>* I won't pretend that I know much about hip hop, but I find it hard to believe that anyone can make it all the way through &quot;A Milli&quot; when wearing headphones. On the other hand, the parts of &quot;Lollipop&quot; that aren't stupid are genius.</p>

                    <p>It looks bad on paper. A rap song about the Blagojevich scandal filled with wonky in-jokes? Sure, points for adopting a timely form. But <a class="reference external" href="http://www.markrussell.net/">Mark Russell</a> could set up a MySpace page, and that wouldn't make it okay. Actually, it'd just underscore the outrages that he continues to perpetrate.</p>
<p>But damn if Spencer doesn't have a knack for this stuff. This isn't the first such track I've heard him cut that runs along these lines. Could anyone write a verse as verbally profane as Blagojevich's profaning of the public trust? Probably not, but that doesn't mean you can't try:</p>

                    <p>Alright, enough of this &quot;saying nice things about employers&quot; nonsense. That's not what the internet is about! It's about complaining, goddammit. So let's do some of that.</p>
<p>To wit: the YMCA. Man, I really like the YMCA. I grew up going to one with my family; once I moved into the city I joined the National Capital Y pretty quickly. It's not the cheapest or best-appointed gym out there, but I find the atmosphere congenial. Everything's old: from the unused wall nozzles that powered pneumatic equipment back in the day; to the inch-thick layer of paint on the walls; to the patrons themselves, who wander about the locker room naked while endlessly discussing squash (whatever that is). The skeptical, tentative, ever-inconclusive conversations among themerely-fiftyish men offer a glimpse into the bureaucratic lifestyle that's hard to find anywhere else. It's not exciting, but it's an essential part of this city, goddammit.</p>
<p>But they've invited my wrath. Two things. First: when I signed up, they corralled me into some sort of reverse direct deposit business. I hate doing these things because I'm paranoid about giving companies the keys to my checking account. And hey, guess what? I got a letter from the Y, and I (<a class="reference external" href="/2007/08/20/admitting-defeat/">somewhat improbably</a>) opened it, and they had decided to help themselves to an extra $25 or $50 or whatever. Times are tough, you know. They were sure I wouldn't mind. They just took it out from the larger wad of money, I probably wouldn't even notice, and besides they needed it for cigarettes so they could smoke with the seniors at lunch.</p>
<p>This left me feeling rather cross, and the reaction from the folks at the front desk (&quot;it's only $25&quot;) only buttressed my righteous indignation. But further indignities laid in wait.</p>
<p>Kickball. They're hosting kickball again this winter. Not that I remember them ever having done so before, but the signs in the hallway claim they did. Perhaps we have always been at war with kickball; I don't really know. I do know that this fills the hallways with clots of drunk or soon-to-be-drunk assholes, who whoop and don't get out of my way even when I say &quot;excuse me&quot; (admittedly through gritted teeth and a facial expression designed to drive the observer to suicide). It's a bad situation, and if you ask me, pretty disrespectful of the Y's dues-paying members, all of whom detest the kickballers.</p>
<p>I should say: I know people who play kickball who I like very much. That's the social scene they found themselves in, and so they play kickball. I can't fault them for that. Hell, my ancestors owned slaves — we're all victims of our milieu. Further, I understand perfectly well the need to invent flimsy social pretexts to justify increasingly worrying levels of post-graduation alcohol consumption. But most people don't conduct their writing workshops or networking events or connoisseurship rituals in the hallway leading to the fifth floor weight room — that's the key difference, I think. Kickball has got to go.</p>
<p>The combination of the two is especially galling. Kickball's awash in money — you can tell because the idiots responsible <a class="reference external" href="http://dcist.com/2008/08/05/kickball_lawsuit_finally_strikes_ou.php">keep trying to sue each other</a>. This is a for-profit enterprise that's wormed its drunken way into my quasi-charitable dues-based fitness club. And yet on top of the imposition-for-cash, they <em>also</em> need to steal from me? It's a bit much. The first time I run into people playing flipcup in the locker room I'm going to wind up killing somebody.</p>

                    <p>Well, past assurances to the contrary, it turns out that I haven't really been blogging here. I will! Soon! But it's my first week on the new job, and I've been busy. Also, I've been tired: I've never been very good at waking up in the morning. At EchoDitto I'd come into work at 10 and leave around 6 or 7 or 8 if I needed to get something done. Sunlight operates on a more normal schedule, and while I've been managing to wake up without major difficulties, I haven't yet gotten this &quot;go home/to bed slightly earlier&quot; thing down yet. So I'm a little exhausted.</p>
<p>Things are going well, though. It's a bit lonesome in my office, but that'll be fixed as soon as I hire some folks (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.transparencyjobs.com/jobs/56/">Here's</a> the job listing for the first position we're hiring for, incidentally. I haven't yet posted the link anywhere else — it's a Manifest Density exclusive!). And as of yesterday I have an enormous whiteboard to keep me company, which is nice.</p>
<p>I've mostly just been getting acclimated: drafting some documents, going to meetings, and finding opportunities to familiarize myself with Sunlight's technology. You know how first weeks go. Everybody's been extremely friendly, and it's really great to have the latitude and time to figure out the right way to solve the problem we're facing.</p>
<p>I do have one complaint, though:</p>

                    <p>I haven't written anything here all week, and didn't write much for a while beforehand. That's because I've been putting off writing this post.</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/510952105/"><img alt="Jason Goad's EchoDitto Poster" class="center" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/206/510952105_4a7ee66e0d.jpg" style="width: 354px; height: 500px;" /></a></p>
<p>Today is my last day at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.echoditto.com">EchoDitto</a>. As you might imagine, it's a bit depressing. Soon I'm going to have to pack up my desk, clean my stuff out of the fridge, and play my last game of foosball as a non-guest. This is, admittedly, all fairly trivial stuff. But I'm the sort of guy who feels wistful about throwing out old CD cases, for god's sake. Change is hard.</p>
<p>Genuinely, objectively awful: the fact that I have to leave my coworkers. I've been incredibly privileged to work with people this kind and smart and funny. I've learned a tremendous amount from them: about business, about running projects, about new technologies, and about leading people. And I've gotten to do it while working with some pretty cool clients: SEIU, Mother Jones and Greenpeace UK all spring to mind; plus I've gotten to contribute, at least peripherally, to efforts on behalf of the Clinton Global Initiative, Seventh Generation and the EFF, among many others.</p>
<p>But it's time to move on — I've felt that way for a little while, to be honest. The sorts of projects you get as a consultant can be a bit homogenous. Billable-hours work can be a drag. And I have to admit: I'm pretty sick of Drupal. I figured that if I was going to keep doing this sort of work, I might go freelance for a bit — even PHP is fun to code when you're in your pajamas. Or maybe I'd wander the earth fighting injustice. I hadn't really decided.</p>
<p>Something came up first, though, and I'm extremely excited about it. As of Monday I'll be working for the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.sunlightfoundation.com">Sunlight Foundation</a>, an organization that I've long admired. I'll be heading up the technical side of their latest project — it's exciting, and daunting, and I can't wait to get started. It'll mean a whole new suite of technologies and challenges; a chance to assemble and lead a team of programmers; and an opportunity to build a tool that — if we do it right — could help people understand some of the ways our government works and how they could be improved. And, importantly, it'll be a chance to learn from a whole new set of brilliant colleagues.</p>
<p>You'll be hearing much more about this from me soon; for now, suffice it to say that I'd love to hear from any talented developers who might be reading (particularly if they know Python) — thomas.j.lee (at) (google's popular email service).</p>
<p>It's going to be strange to leave EchoDitto. <a class="reference external" href="http://www.zunta.org/blog/archives/2005/11/23/decisions/">Three years ago I asked for advice about whether I should come work here</a>. The best advice I got was from Tripp:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">My experience in the tech world is that after awhile it *all* becomes relatively boring. Today's kewl new becomes tommorow's has been. Most of the kewl new is hype and remarketing of the old.</div>
<div class="line">So my advice is to focus on the people. How do you feel about the people you currently work with? If you feel good and you think it will stay that way then stick it out.</div>
<div class="line">Good people can make boring work fun, and after awhile ALL work becomes boring. I say this after 27 years in the booming computer field.</div>
<div class="line">So focus on working with good people.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>He was right. Six months later I wrote this (while <a class="reference external" href="http://www.zunta.org/blog/archives/2006/06/02/pimping_actuall/">shamelessly trawling for hires</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
People use the phrase &quot;it was the best decision I ever made&quot; to describe getting a hair transplant, or buying a boat, or ordering a Cobb salad. So I'd like to avoid joining their idiomatic ranks, but I can't. It just seems so obvious. These are the smartest, coolest, funniest, most talented people I've ever worked with, and the job itself is interesting, varied and rewarding. I look forward to work every day. Okay, every non-hungover day.</blockquote>
<p>I'd be lying if I said I was still quite that giddy on a day-to-day basis. Things have settled down, I've gotten older, and the nature of the business — and the internet — has changed. But the part about the people is still true. I've met a lot of amazing folks because of EchoDitto. Thanks to all of you for letting me count you among my friends.</p>
