                    <p>As part of the holiday season's string of irresponsible purchases I picked up an Xbox 360. I haven't been playing very much so far, and what I have been playing is pretty exclusively Halo 3. But it seems likely that Charles and I will acquire some other digital entertainments in the future, so if you're on Xbox Live you should add us to your friends list regardless of how you feel about sort-of-lame first person shooters set in decidedly lame, transparently derivative sci-fi universes.</p>
<p>Sigh. I miss Quake 3.</p>
<p>At any rate, our gamertag is &quot;Club Loser&quot;, which is not at all coincidentally what we called Jeff's videogame-filled basement during middle and high school. Come teach this n00b a lesson.</p>

                    <p>It's now safe to say: I'm sick. This is no surprise, of course — it happens to me every winter, and with enough severity that I'm told I'm commonly described as &quot;sickly&quot;. But I had high hopes for this year! I've started taking vitamin D, The Supernutrient They Don't Want You To Know About (except via features in Reader's Digest). I'm adopting an optimistic interpretation of the vitamin's powers and assuming that without it my body would presently be undergoing incineration at the hands of concerned NIH workers in contamination suits.</p>
<p>I take some comfort in knowing that this bug has also laid waste to everyone else I know. Considering that my immune system is capable of amplifying the pathogens contained in a kitten's single adorable sneeze into a maelstrom of phlegm and whining worthy of an unusually tedious episode of <em>House</em>, this is an improvement. At least I know my body's surrendering to a worthy microbe.</p>

                    <p>I may as well add my two cents, speaking as both an all-around nerd and someone who bought a gig of RAM this holiday season (it's the gift that says &quot;Baby, I consider reducing your disk swap space usage a subcomponent of 'treating you right'&quot;). RAM is indeed ridiculously cheap right now — there've been allegations of price-fixing in the memory industry, in fact, as the players try to grapple with the bottom falling out of their market. But a few things about buying memory for your Mac:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Macbooks can only take up to two gigs. Current-generation MBPs can accept 4 gigs. Buying more than this is pointless. Unless you have a particularly memory-hungry application, 2GB is probably as much as you'll notice having. <strong>UPDATE:</strong> Yglesias pointed out to me that I'm wrong — current-generation Macbooks can take 4 gigs, too. You should still probably only buy 2.</li>
<li>Macs are notoriously finicky about memory. Buying a name brand is probably worth the slight price bump. Crucial is a well-regarded brand, if you're looking for a suggestion.</li>
<li>You only get two memory slots in MBs and MBPs, and one of them will already have a stick of RAM in it. Plan accordingly.</li>
<li>You're looking to buy DDR2 SODIMMs.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.newegg.com">Newegg</a> is a good, reputable place to get dirt-cheap prices on memory.</li>
</ul>

                    <p>I whined about not fulfilling my technical aspirations over the holiday, but the truth is that I did get a few things done — just not the ones I had intended. I wasted a solid couple of days trying to get Boot Camp installed, for one thing (it turns out not to be so easy when you have a heavily fragmented disk and aren't willing to reformat it). And I constructed this monstrosity:</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/2162551515/"><img alt="probably ill-advised" class="center" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2110/2162551515_9f2cfb5d90_m.jpg" style="width: 180px; height: 240px;" /></a></p>
<p>We'd hung up lights for a little holiday shindig, you see. But this year we were forced into the bigger-bulbed option, as Target's clearance Christmas light section was picked over a bit faster than I had planned. I think it ended up looking a little bit nicer, but the default level of illumination afforded was a little higher than we wanted for a proper party.</p>
<p>So: to Logan hardware! It's actually pretty simple to make a dimmer box suitable for incandescent bulbs. Grab an extension cord, a dimmer switch, a few spare wire nuts, a junction box and a switch faceplate — I'd suggest plastic for the last two items since a) it's cheaper and b) it's less likely to result in your electrocution if you screw something up. All told your purchase should come to under $10.</p>
<p>Snip the extension cord in two, thread it into the junction box and wire it up to the dimmer as the included instructions dictate. The wire connected to the smaller prong on the extension cord's plug is the hot lead — that's the one that gets routed through the dimmer. The other is neutral; reconnect it to itself. If the extension cord has three prongs, the bottom one is ground; it should be reconnected to itself and to the dimmer's ground wire. If there isn't a ground wire, just wrap the dimmer's ground lead up in tape so it can't accidentally come in contact with anything energized.</p>
<p>Screw everything together and voila: you're done. Keep a fire extinguisher handy, never leave this unattended, never connect it to anything other than a reasonably short string of incandescent lights, and resign yourself to my complete disavowal of any responsibility for the results of using this horribly unsafe gadget. It works great for me, though!</p>

                    <p>I forgot to do the <a class="reference external" href="http://dcist.com/2008/01/02/morning_roundup_163.php">morning roundup</a> last night, so I had to wake up early this morning to do it. First: it was surprisingly easy! I guess having two weeks' worth of sleep saved up makes it possible to get up before 9:30. Second: morning news is even worse than I had imagined.</p>
<p>A moment ago CNN's <em>American Morning</em> is engaging in some legal analysis of the recent noise over whether ripping your own CDs to mp3 is illegal. It's true that this is a bit confusing. For instance, although I respect Mike Masnick's <a class="reference external" href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20071211/101325.shtml">analysis</a> of the issue, I disagree with his assertion that the RIAA only objects to users ripping CDs to shared folders. It's always seemed to me that they <em>tolerate</em> such activity, but consider themselves to be doing so thanks to their basically generous nature (and not, of course, out of fear of a crushing backlash from consumers and the courts). One commenter points out that Sony lawyers have <a class="reference external" href="http://www.engadget.com/2007/10/04/sony-bmgs-head-lawyer-says-ripping-cds-is-stealing/">referred</a> to ripping CDs as &quot;a nice way of saying 'steals just one copy.'&quot;</p>
<p>But I do agree with Mike that the media's treatment of these issues has been abysmal. And even granting that the legalities can be murky, CNN's treatment of the story was stunningly bad, revealing that their legal correspondent is not only completely unacquainted with the relevant issues, but couldn't even be bothered to spend a few minutes on Google reading up on them prior to going on the air.</p>

<p>No! The takeaway is that we should grab torches and pitchforks and march down to the courthouse. Or write our congressmen, anyway.</p>
<p>I suppose it's nice that big media outlets are paying attention to these issues. Still, this is pretty piss-poor. The scope of fair use in the digital age may not be as immediate a concern as health care or stagnant wages, but it affects nearly every consumer in the country. People are randomly getting caught in an industry's death throes, and suffering serious financial losses as a result — none of which benefits anyone except the attorneys involved. It's a real problem and we should all be thinking in a deliberate way about how we want to solve it.</p>

                    <p>Well, it's been a pretty restful holiday break, but tomorrow it all ends. This past week or so of vacation has been disappointingly unproductive — I barely got to the gym at all, I didn't really write anything, and I only made minor progress on the two technical projects I had in mind. In fact, I spent an amazingly small amount of time online. If you're one of the people to whom I should've been writing emails, I apologize.</p>
<p>But I did manage to get to a hell of a lot of parties, see a number of old friends (albeit not as many as I would've liked) and wake up on New Year's Day feeling like I was probably not going to die after all (better yet, I didn't even want to!). Pretty good, all in all.</p>
<p>Anyway, all I really mean to say here is that I'm looking forward to returning to routine. I'm hoping that 2008 is bloggier, healthier and even more fun than 2007 was.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>Well, Christmas has been successfully completed. I went to parties, ate holiday-themed foodstuffs, and visited a whole bunch of relatives. All in all, it was a pretty nice time.</p>
<p>I also managed to have a traditional Jewish Christmas with Matt, Brian and Spencer, first at the third annual Christmas Eve visit to the Red Room and then with a meal of Chinese food and a screening of <em>Alien vs. Predator: Requiem</em>, which was totally great. If the &quot;requiem&quot; in the title had you worrying that this would be more of an art-house flick, let me encourage you to give the movie a chance anyway. Sure, it's kind of a think piece. But that one time when the guy gets acid blood dripped on his arm and he's all like AAAH AAAH AAAH and then his arm falls off and his kid's right there? And then it gets <em>worse</em>? Pretty awesome. Also, all of that happens in the first five minutes.</p>
<p>But it <em>did</em> get me thinking. I found myself discussing politics at various points during Holiday Family Time, and frequently trying to explain why I didn't think my relatives should be as favorably disposed toward bold truth-teller Ron Paul as their initial impression of the man had left them.</p>
<p>Ezra already did a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/ezraklein_archive?month=12&amp;year=2007&amp;base_name=the_full_paul">much better job of this</a> than I ever could. But, predictably, some of the Paul supporters in his comment section remain unconvinced. I mean, sure, there might be some minor downsides to dismantling our already meager social safety net, adopting a set of monetary policies that most economists think would be disastrous, and in general returning the most brutal excesses of rapacious late nineteenth century capitalism. But that's all a small price to pay for the satisfaction to be had from an intellectually consistent political philosophy, right? Besides, Paul's supporters have got a blimp. It seems like you'd have to be <a class="reference external" href="http://slate.com/blogs/blogs/trailhead/archive/2007/12/21/blimpin-ain-t-easy.aspx">pretty on top of things</a> to have a blimp.</p>
<p>But <em>AvP2</em> has provided what I think is a compelling argument against the Paul platform. Consider this: if Dr. Paul is keen to remove us from our foreign entanglements and dismantle the Department of Education (take <em>that</em>, tyranny!), what hope do you think there is for the Bureau of Secretly Nuking Small American Towns After Alien Invasions? You think you're going to be able to fund that after getting rid of the income tax? Please.</p>
<p>Now I know that I'm likely to get some Paul supporters showing up in comments, arguing that perhaps we'd actually be better off without faceless government bureaucrats deciding in secret whether to rain nuclear death upon small town America. To this I can only say: go watch <em>Alien vs. Predator: Requiem</em> and then get back to me. I'll admit that I'm not all that familiar with the complete works of Friedrich Hayek, but I would be surprised if it deals adequately with how the state should respond to rapacious space invaders with mouths-within-mouths and acid for blood.</p>
<p>Big government: it's the only way to be sure.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>Last night I stumbled across HBO's half-hour promo for season 5 of The Wire. Previous seasons have addressed the police, local politics, unions and schools. This season is supposed to take a characteristically blunt look at the media. The preview was, uh, surprising — for a couple of reasons:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Joe Klein is featured as the voice of downtrodden journalism! For some reason he was selected to express the concerns of the in-the-trenches, unheralded-hero reporter. My journalist friends assure me that this was an <em>especially</em> inspired choice for representing those who are asked to &quot;do more with less&quot; (after all, he <a class="reference external" href="http://www.salon.com/opinion/greenwald/2007/11/26/klein/index.html">apparently</a> makes do without fact checkers).</li>
<li>David Simon does not care for the internet. Yeah, superficial attention was paid to the increasingly hard-headed, businesslike approach of the news industry. But that complaint's well-worn and was consequently skimmed over. Mostly, the writers and talking heads from the Baltimore Sun seemed eager to complain about newspapers' willingness to give their content away on the web. That they consider this a strategic mistake rather than an inevitable capitulation demonstrates an understanding of the world that's uncharacteristically shallow for something associated with this franchise.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, it'd be dumb to write off the coming season on the basis of a promotional special. David Simon's political philosophy seems to run more along the lines of &quot;everything's fucked, all the time&quot; than toward simple scapegoating. So perhaps the carping crammed into that thirty minutes was simplistic by necessity.</p>
<p>But the promo was still discouraging. I worry that Simon's writerly pretensions might make him unduly lionize the big city newsroom, an environment that seems like a lot of fun for entitled smartasses who self-describe as &quot;scrappy&quot;, but which increasingly seems like a 20th century quirk that's no longer economically sustainable. I admit I'm as likely to bitchily lament the loss of a free ride as anyone — but then I'm not a journalist, and I haven't got a TV show to run. Those who do saw fit to include in this promotional program the Sun's television critic, who cites the paper's employment of only <em>one</em> such TV critic as evidence of newsprint's decline. To this, one can only say <em>FUCK YOU</em>: the internet has made it very, very clear that having opinions about TV is not something for which people need to be compensated. The amount of self-awareness on display in the promo show was less than inspiring.</p>
<p>So I confess I'm a little worried. Simon's provided cutting, complex critiques of police, politicians and schools. And admittedly, he's done this despite his co-creator Ed Burns having a personal stake in two of those three systems. But I wonder if Simon will be able to confront these simple facts: that business models based on the difficulty of distributing information are no longer viable; and that the media's vulnerability to competition from amateur blogospheric efforts is, rather than an unfortunate cosmic injustice, almost entirely the result of the industry's failure to implement a proper meritocracy. The fifth season promo's inkstained hagiography was not encouraging on this score.</p>
<p>The Wire's different and great because it seems more honest than anything else on television. But this season's the first in which its creator is going to be writing about himself and his friends. I imagine they'll probably pull it off, but the early signs are not good.</p>

<p>The man behind it, a Carnegie Mellon doctoral student named Johnny Lee, has <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/%7Ejohnny/projects/wii/">a number of other awesome Wiimote-related projects</a> and has been getting attention from Hackaday and MAKE as a result.

                    <p>Ryan <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ryanavent.com/blog/?p=662">disagrees</a> with my Christmas rock boosterism. I'll just go ahead and quote the whole post:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">I have to tell you guys, I am not a fan of Christmas rock songs and/or modern interpretations of old Christmas stand-bys. Why is this? I donâ€™t know. Pretty much the only departure from Burl Ivesâ€™ old school standards Iâ€™ll tolerate (love actually) is Vince Guaraldiâ€™s Charlie Brown Christmas soundtrack. Although I do like the Velvet Fog doing â€œA Christmas Song.â€?</div>
<div class="line">This may have something to do with a deep sense that Christmas is actually a celebration of the past more than anything elseâ€“not something to be modernized. Or it could just be the long, looooong list of abominations resulting from contemporary acts doing Christmas songs.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Naturally, I feel differently. To me the Christmas standards don't feel so much classic as they do dated. They were a part of my childhood, so of course I enjoy listening to them for the sake of nostalgia. But I think that it's wrong to consider them as the ur-Christmas songs. &quot;Holly Jolly Christmas&quot;, &quot;Winter Wonderland&quot;, &quot;Rudolph&quot; — <em>those</em> were the songs that constituted a departure from the past, as song &amp; dance men cranked out superficial, secular story-songs in tandem with the rise of the Christmas-Industrial complex.</p>
<p>In some ways I think the best of the new songs actually harken back to the pre-ditty era of Christmas music. Not because they're reconnecting with the holiday's religious aspect, but because the songs are able to tap into a pool of surprisingly universal experience. With partial apologies to my Jewish friends, there are plenty of emotionally resonant aspects to this time of year that we've all felt: wintery quiet, loneliness, warmth, grandeur, joy. I won't sit here and pretend that <em>Maybe This Christmas XXIV</em> brings tears to my eyes, but it's likely to be a hell of a lot more artistically successful than a song about a magical snowman.</p>

<p>The greatest Christmas rock song of all time, is, of course, <a class="reference external" href="http://hypem.com/search/fairytale%20of%20new%20york/1/">The Pogues' &quot;Fairytale of New York&quot;</a>, but this entry from Frightened Rabbit has quickly vaulted into my number two spot — evidence, perhaps, of the weakness of the field. But there are a few others that I think can be defended in the clear light of day, even when judgment is unclouded by wood smoke and wassail.</p>
<p>There are some obvious ones. John Lennon's &quot;So This Is Christmas&quot; and Run DMC's &quot;Christmas Is&quot; are both classics and so hardly worth mentioning. The Kinks' &quot;<a class="reference external" href="http://fuelfriends.blogspot.com/2007/12/christmas-mixery.html">Father Christmas</a>&quot; is just as good but more often neglected, which is a shame. And U2's &quot;Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)&quot; is pretty damn great — it's probably my second-favorite U2 song behind &quot;Red Hill Mining Town&quot;, if only because when Bono cracks up mid-verse you can tell that for at least three seconds he's not trying to save the world. Unfortunately, the music blogosphere considers U2 so desperately uncool that I can't find a playable copy of the song on the Hype Machine. But if you'd rather listen to Death Cab For Cutie's awful, awful cover, there are <a class="reference external" href="http://hypem.com/search/baby%20please%20come%20home/1/">about a zillion copies available</a>. It is, if nothing else, a useful demonstration of every single thing that's wrong with Ben Gibbard and his mostly-fine band.</p>
<p>Those are all very well-known songs, though. Here are three more that, while not exactly obscure, haven't entirely made their way out of the Christmas compilation ghetto. But they're all genuinely good songs (if not very creatively titled):</p>

                    <p>I got my FON router and Arduino to talk to each other, and I'm pretty excited about it. You can find the details <a class="reference external" href="http://labs.echoditto.com/hacking-la-fonera-2">here</a> if you're interested.</p>
<p>Put in simple terms, this lets me translate any information I can pull from the net into physical action. There are limits, of course — can I stream WOXY or play YouTube clips through an Arduino? No. It's a much simpler device than that — one that's basically capable of reading and sending a little more than a dozen low-voltage signals, and about half as many low-voltage analog signals.</p>
<p>But you can get a lot done with these seemingly humble capabilities. I could control appliances; I could wire it into an RC car's remote control; I could use it to open and close my garage door over the internet; I could monitor the temperature in my apartment and send myself an email if the furnace broke.</p>
<p>I'm aiming for something simpler to begin with: the analog display of some interesting online information, courtesy of some cool-looking gauges. If anyone's got a line on awesome-looking vintage electronic equipment that I can tear apart, please let me know.</p>

                    <p>Jeff has <a class="reference external" href="http://www.jeffnye.org/adventures/2007/12/that_time_of_year.php">commanded</a> that year-end lists be produced; let it be so.</p>
<p>Actually, though, I can't recommend too much. There were a lot of albums that I wanted to like but ultimately found disappointing. Okkervil River never grabbed me after the single; neither did The National. Patrick Wolf wears out his welcome after the first three songs. Le Loup's album is more of a one-trick pony than was initially apparent. And although I love a number of tracks on Dan Deacon's album (mostly the ones where he keeps his mouth shut), I found &quot;Wham City&quot; and its ilk to be really grating. Jens Lekman's too precious, Polyphonic Spree evolved one album too late, Los Campesinos couldn't seal the deal and Of Montreal proved to be astoundingly irritating. Man, there's no pleasing me! It seemed like a year of singles, with precious few full-lengths worth listening to end-to-end.</p>
<p>But there were a few albums I couldn't help playing over and over. This list isn't going to blow any minds, but I enjoyed writing it out. Y'know, for posterity.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Arcade Fire — Neon Bible</dt>
<dd>Predictable, I know. Well, so's the rest of my list. I'm putting this first, though, because it's the one I feel most lukewarm toward. It's full of good music, but it's fundamentally a betrayal. AF's first album was all about their fear of growing old, growing callous, feeling less. They howled and screamed and swore that they'd figure a way out of it. Then they didn't. Thanks a fucking lot, guys. That the only track recapturing their original manifesto — &quot;No Cars Go&quot; — was a new version of a song from their debut EP only added insult to injury. Still, they make some awfully pretty sounds.</dd>
<dt>Feist – The Reminder</dt>
<dd>It's really good. C'mon, you've seen the ad. Who are you to resist?</dd>
<dt>The Cribs – Men's Needs, Women's Needs, Whatever</dt>
<dd>It's just a consistently good rock album. If you ask me, an inability to say more than that makes for a relatively rare sort of endorsement.</dd>
<dt>Stars – Up In Our Bedroom After The War</dt>
<dd>Maybe I just didn't understand Stars when I listened to their last album. Or, more likely, maybe I was just clinging to the pretension that I'm not the sort of guy who listens to musical theater voluntarily. Well, I'm over it. This album isn't uniformly great, but it has enough standout pop songs that the rest can be considered pleasant-enough glue. After all, you've got to have some quiet solo pieces to kill time while the stagehands move the set around.</dd>
<dt>The Wombats – Girls, Boys and Marsupials</dt>
<dd>Alright, so this technically came out in 2006. But their stuff is just now trickling out in US releases, so I feel alright about mentioning it. <em>This</em> is what I was hoping to hear as I diligently listened to the Arctic Monkeys and Cold War Kids. Between The Wombats and The Cribs I guess this year found me in the mood for bratty English vocals. The songs are funny and clever and dumb, and awfully good.
And yes, I'm still mourning the Unicorns.</dd>
<dt>Spoon – Ga Ga Ga Ga Ga</dt>
<dd>Far and away the best album of the year — for me, it's really not even close. I think I once drunkenly described this album as &quot;economical&quot;, and I may as well stand by that. Everything is so well-constructed, every gesture placed with such casual perfection that it's tempting to conclude that it couldn't be more than a cold architectural exercise. But when faced with the opening Motown chimes of &quot;You Got Yr. Cherry Bomb&quot;, that idea melts away. Also: points for brevity.</dd>
</dl>
<p>This year was also the first in which I listened to much electronic (or at least non-rock, non-rap) music. I'm not straying too far from my familiar pop pastures — RJD2, Ratatat, Diplo, the aforementioned Mr. Deacon, that sort of thing. I'll be the first to admit that I don't know very much about the genres contained under the electronic umbrella, and probably need to spend some more time listening diligently and uncritically. But I'm trying, at least a little. I realize that millions of club kids can't be wrong. I'm the one who's wrong.</p>
<p>With that said, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/47681-staff-list-top-100-tracks-of-2007/page_1">Pitchfork's list of the year's best songs</a> still baffles me. &quot;All My Friends&quot; sounds to me like a not-that-good Franz Ferdinand song and little more. And somewhere around the fifth minute of Battles' &quot;Atlas&quot; I get <em>real</em> sick of hearing plodding repetitions of melodies that could be ably picked out on a keyboard with two fingers. I'm of the opinion that Daft Punk made their point a while ago and should now be polite enough to leave me alone.</p>
<p>My lack of patience is probably to blame. If you set up a melodic pattern I want my expectations of how it's going to progress to be promptly defied. Going through the motions for an extra measure or two earns my boredom (and ill will) very quickly. Perhaps this consigns me to a life of listening to variations on the same tired three minute pop song — I realize that a very limited bag of tricks is being used over and over again to surprise and delight me. But so far I'm not sick of it.</p>
<p>Finally, one last bit of carping: I'm really surprised that the M.I.A. juggernaut continues to roll along. It seems like a transparent case of style over substance to me, but people <em>really</em> seem to dig her stuff. So I'll say that I think I must be missing something and hope that my half-earnestness counts as personal growth.</p>

                    <p>Kind of funny: <a class="reference external" href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/12/15/misunderstanding-copyright-law-and-ruining-everyones-fun/">reading Michael Arrington pissily explain to everyone how the unauthorized use of a photographer's photo in a satirical video is &quot;fair use&quot; and getting it all totally fucking wrong</a>.</p>
<p>At least he had the good sense to back off, in comments, from his ludicrous initial argument: that the fair use exception for satire allows <em>any</em> copyrighted material to be used in the parody — regardless of whether it's the subject of the parody or not. If that were the case, Mad Magazine could probably enjoy a sales bump by including burned copies of Photoshop as inserts.</p>
<p>But even in his new, more moderate position (fair use by fiat), Arrington is still wrong. It's an increasingly common mistake: folks use a low-fidelity version of a copyrighted work for illustrative purposes within the context of a larger original work and assume it's okay. It sure <em>seems</em> like this should be okay — it's not the main point of the work, it's just decoration. And it was so easy! I'm all for making this sort of thing kosher when employed by noncommercial projects, but right now it's not. It'd be nice if Arrington was a little less preachy when talking out of his ass.</p>

                    <p>I put up a <a class="reference external" href="http://labs.echoditto.com/hacking-la-fonera">rather long post over at EchoDitto Labs</a> about this, but here's the teaser version: you can get routers from the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.fon.com">FON</a> project for very little money — sometimes free, or about $10 on Ebay. With some effort, you can load them with a custom firmware that gives you a Linux environment that can connect to wifi networks. This <em>also</em> gives you a set of four or five general purpose input/output pins and a (somewhat more accessible) serial port, all of which you can, in theory, connect to an Arduino. Put together, this equals a very cheap wifi interface for your microcontroller project — the fact that it comes with powerful Linux capabilities is just icing on the cake.</p>
<p>It's pretty small, too. So aside from probably consuming electricity faster than a $125 wifi module designed for embedded systems would, it's really a very, very slick solution.</p>
<p>Of course, this is all still kind of theoretical. I've gotten the wifi interface working, and am able to control an LED from the Linux shell. That's enough to interface with the Arduino meaningfully, but I haven't yet tackled the job of connecting it to the serial port.</p>
