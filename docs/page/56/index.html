<p>It's perhaps not the most mind-blowing thing they've ever recorded. But I'm glad to hear it for two reasons. First, it isn't a radical departure from their last album (I want more!). And second, it makes me think about what it'll be like to once again see Winn Butler singing it like he's never meant anything more, while the strings swell and the percussionists go crazy. More <a class="reference external" href="http://pitchforkmedia.com/page/news/2006/12/11/Arcade_Fire_Announce_More_Shows#40130">tour dates</a>, please.</p>
<p>The above link is to a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.coralcdn.org/">Coral Cache</a> URL — it should hopefully work a little more snappily (and long-lastingly) than the original source, which still seems to be getting hammered (or maybe it's just my connection).

<p>Actually though, I haven't been to too many office Christmas parties. I've usually been lucky enough to be out of town or otherwise busy on the date in question. But right before I quit my old job I did attend one at my boss's house, and it wasn't too bad. Over the course of the evening I watched the Irish guys who populated the office gradually get drunker, redder and angrier, which was more entertainment than I had been expecting.</p>
<p>Eventually the situation was defused by the dissemination of the holiday bonus giftcards. After that, everyone left within five minutes. It wasn't a lot of fun, but it wasn't <em>that</em> bad. No worse than sitting through church, anyway.</p>
<p>But I was subjected to some entertainingly bad Christmas gifts from that job. I shouldn't really complain about the bonuses (or lack thereof) because I was generally compensated pretty well, particularly toward the end of my tenure. But there's no excuse for this:</p>
<p><img alt="a godawful denim shirt" class="center" src="http://static.flickr.com/21/89421899_233c5eb9e1.jpg" /></p>
<p>Yup, the first Christmas bonus I ever received was a button-up denim shirt with the company logo on it (and a friendly reminder that we were <a class="reference external" href="https://eweb1.sba.gov/hubzone/internet/index.cfm">HUBZone Certified</a>). And it was at least three sizes too large. Admittedly, I'm a computer programmer — it wasn't wholly unreasonable to assume that I'd grow into it, so to speak. But size aside, there was no conceivable use for the shirt that didn't involve the phrase &quot;booth at a trade show&quot;. It was more of a threat than a gift.</p>
<p>Things picked up, though. The next year I got some House of Representatives cufflinks that were actually kind of nice, but unfortunately <a class="reference external" href="http://www.wonkette.com/politics/late-night-shots/the-late-night-shots-christmas-special-222006.php">not something that I would ever wear in this town</a>. Call it a wash, I guess.</p>
<p>But my final Christmas at that job was indisputably great. The Amex gift card was a nice surprise, but the real treat was this:</p>
<p><img alt="horrible monkey" class="center" src="http://static.flickr.com/128/323240717_a75ff55876.jpg" /></p>
<p>I won it in the gift swap (my contribution to which was a pen that lit up when your cell phone rang, except actually didn't). Pictures can't convey how awful this ceramic sculpture is. I've seen this monkey elicit physical reactions of disgust in its viewers — it really does sort of make your skin crawl. This pleases me immensely, and it remains one of my most prized possessions.</p>
<p>But I think the era of the awful holiday party may be over for me — for now, anyway. EchoDitto's is on Monday, and it promises to be pleasantly full of booze and food. I begged out of last year's celebration since I hadn't yet started the job, but by all accounts it was pretty fun. So I'm looking forward to this one. The only problem is that I've got nothing lined up for the gift swap. I suppose I could always bring the monkey, but I don't think I'm ready to pass that torch just yet.</p>

                    <p>I've got a couple of projects in the works centering around novel interfaces — specifically, some hijinks with Asterisk and my poor, neglected <a class="reference external" href="http://www.arduino.cc">Arduino</a>. The only problem with this is that it means I have to have something to interface with. Drat.</p>
<p>So, to resolve this issue I went ahead and wrote an implementation of Tetris in <a class="reference external" href="http://www.processing.org">Processing</a>. Since that's kind of boring, I spent some additional time (okay, a lot of additional time) rewriting my one original contribution to the field of Tetrology: a fancy sinusoidal effect that I came up with in high school (let's hear it for Pascal!). I hope you'll find it as confusing as I do.</p>
<p>Of course, based on early reports from my expert beta tester[STRIKEOUT:s], there's a fairly decent chance that this will crash your browser. If it already has, uh, sorry. I'm sure you'll take comfort in the fact that it runs fine on my machines.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> That's enough browser crashing for one day. I've moved the applet below the fold so that this website doesn't mean instant death for affected users. It's weird that this is happening — I don't think I'm doing anything <em>too</em> exotic. And I'd expect Processing to protect me from causing these kinds of crashes (and expect the Java VM, upon which it's based, to offer further protection). I guess that's not the case. Well, maybe a future release of Processing will produce better results. Sorry for the inconvenience.</p>

                    <p>I've now got an iSight camera built into the lid of my laptop. Naturally, I've been unable to resist the urge to play with it, so I spent about a minute on Wednesday morning writing a Perl script designed to take a steady stream of images. Then I let it run throughout the day. The results are pretty creepy, like a drug-use montage. And, yeah, a little longer than I'd like — but there are special guest appearances beginning about halfway through.</p>

<p>Lots of other people have taken videos like this one, and I'm sure there are better methods. But if you're curious to try it yourself, here's how I did it:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">Download and install <a class="reference external" href="http://www.macupdate.com/info.php/id/18598">iSightCapture</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><div class="first line-block">
<div class="line">Copy this perl script to an empty directory and run it from there. Use control-C to stop it when you've taken enough shots.</div>
</div>
<blockquote>
<pre class="literal-block">
#!/usr/bin/perl
while(1==1)
{
# grab a shot and name it in order
my $time = time();
`isightcapture $time.jpg`;
# wait for one second. because of the
# time isightcapture takes to run,
# this results in roughly one exposure
# every three seconds
sleep(1);
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><div class="first line-block">
<div class="line">Download and compile <a class="reference external" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jpegtoavi/">JpegToAvi</a> (it may be finicky about compiling on OS X — I had to run it from a Linux machine). Run the executable (while in the directory with all the JPEGs) like so:</div>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>ls *.jpg | tr '\n' ' ' | /path/to/jpegtoavi -f 30 640 480 &gt; output.avi</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Edit the AVI in your program of choice — I used iMovie to add the music and strip out the parts where we went for lunch or coffee. Then export it to a compressed format and upload it to your favorite video-sharing site. Don't bother with YouTube: I tried it twice and with a variety of export formats, and it choked on the file each time, producing clips that were only one second long. <a class="reference external" href="http://www.blip.tv">Blip.tv</a> worked great, though.</p>

<div class="line">Well, I'm back home, or at least on the Dulles toll road. We landed almost an hour late, but the flight was mostly pleasant and uneventful. I <strong>did</strong> sit behind a human being with what may be the worst sense of taste I've ever encountered — and if you've ever heard one of my own full-throated defenses of the movie <em>Predator</em>, you know that's saying something.</div>
<div class="line">But picture, if you will, an individual watching a DVD set of the NBC series <em>Las Vegas</em> on her laptop. I mean, it's one thing if you're sitting at home on a Saturday night, desperate to have Nicki Cox distract you from the crushing weight of existence. But to see someone pay for the privilege of taking that experience with them anywhere... Well, it was troubling, at the least. Then, when I saw that the laptop was sitting next to a Lonely Planet guide to Florida, I knew that that pleasant-seeming lady was utterly doomed.</div>
<div class="line">(I know that I've got friends, family and maybe readers in Florida. But c'mon — you know what I'm talking about.)</div>
<div class="line"><strong>ALSO:</strong> can anyone explain to me why TSA insists on cell phones being turned off while you're in the line for customs or waiting for your bags afterward? I can believe there may be a good reason, but like most air travel regulations on cellphones, I have a feeling it's mostly just capricious, officious rulemaking. What could they be worried about, anyway? Someone cheating on their answers to the customs officials? &quot;He's asking me whether I brought back any fruit... I need an answer, quick!&quot;</div>

<div class="line">Werewolves are the only movie monster that I've ever found really terrifying, as I mentioned in <a class="reference external" href="http://www.unfogged.com/archives/week_2006_11_12.html#005780">this</a> unfogged thread. The loss of self and merciless, unstoppable ferocity that underpin the werewolf mythology have always added up to a particularly terrifying sum in my mind — and exposure to a memorable X-Files episode at an impressionable age didn't help matters. Besides, they have none of the saving graces of the other classic monsters: they don't possess any of the vampire's sexy villainy; they only shamble when particularly full, making them harder to escape from than mummies or zombies; and unlike the relatively rare creature from the black lagoon, blob or giant Japanese reptile, werewolves are completely ubiquitous (COMPLETELY. Look out your window right now — you should see at least two.).</div>
<div class="line">I mention all of this because the United Kingdom is <a class="reference external" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082010/">clearly</a> <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werewolves_of_London">ground zero</a> for lycanthropes. This point was underscored by Emily forcing me to begin watching <a class="reference external" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0280609/">Dog Soldiers</a> the day before my departure. It's a movie which — based on the admittedly limited part I've seen so far — seems to be about werewolves viciously disemboweling English infantrymen in the woods of their homeland. That's my understanding, anyway; Emily assures me that it gets much scarier after the point at which we stopped, which, given the inconceivability of further werewolf-terror escalation, makes me think that maybe it'll turn out to be an existential meditation on the banality of existence or something.</div>
<div class="line">Anyway, to lay your fears to rest: day two of this London trip has now drawn to a close, and I have yet to be eviscerated, bitten, or even attacked by a mysteriously large dog that quickly disappeared into the brush. Going into this trip I was <em>sure</em> that at some point Michael would turn to me and say he'd forgotten the adapter for the projector, and would I mind running back to the hotel to fetch it? It shouldn't take me long, it's just across that foggy moonlit moor.</div>
<div class="line">But so far we've managed to remember all of our technical gear. And if I'm under any supernatural curses, the folks from Gre/enpe/ace have at least been nice enough to utter them quietly.</div>

I can tell because the Starbucks I'm sitting in is trying to sell me &quot;crisps&quot;. If not for that, I'd probably have no idea. Jetlag is in full effect, and the last thing I ate was a microwaved airline croissant that I probably shouldn't have.</div>
<div class="line">I'm over here for the training portion of our contract with Gre/enpe/ace UK. And while I recognize that it's pretty boorish to complain about free transatlantic travel, I'm going to do so anyway. Perhaps this trip will be better, but the last one consisted of a bunch of 14+ hour days and one of the worst periods in my personal life that I can remember. By the end of it the near-inevitability of getting creamed by a left-bearing automobile seemed like something to be embraced.</div>
<div class="line">But I'll try to rouse myself. The beer's awfully good, and the folks we're meeting with are smart and fun. Once I've gotten some more sleep and internet I should cheer up pretty quickly.</div>

<div class="line"><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/310373463/"><img alt="box of Cold-Eeze lozenges" class="right" src="http://static.flickr.com/99/310373463_840b11fa5b_m.jpg" /></a>And have been since Sunday. I should've known something was up when the smoke at the Black Cat and <a class="reference external" href="http://cruelsommer.blogspot.com">Sommer</a>'s party started to bother me. I'm usually of at least average hardiness when it comes to friends' cigarette fumes, but this time I was dying.</div>
<div class="line">For once, I recognized my symptoms for what they were and immediately took countermeasures. My mom favors echinacea, but the male side of my family demands rigorous pseudo-scientific analyses that have been published in a respected journal, or at least on the back of an authoritative-looking cardboard box. So I started consuming zinc lozenges at a prodigious rate.</div>
<div class="line">If you start taking it quickly enough, zinc gluconate is supposed to decrease the length of colds by, I don't know, ramping up your white blood cell production, or <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galvanize">galvanizing</a> them or something. They say they've got studies proving it works, but of course it's hard to judge from first-hand experience.</div>
<div class="line">The initial results weren't promising. I was laid pretty low; my body shut down all non-essential processes — alertness, cleverness, interest in the Britney Spears divorce — leaving only those biological systems necessary for maintaining a steady stream of whining. But I think I'm getting better, or at least trading old symptoms for new ones — and by my standards it's happening relatively quickly, too. I don't think this is going to become my annual epic month-long illness (tentative arrival date: February).</div>
<div class="line">Anyway, I'll heartily recommend the zinc drops, if only because they let you feel like you're doing something to improve things, instead of just wallowing in phlegm and misery. But there is a downside: you're supposed to suck on them, not swallow them. They don't taste particularly great, but they're bearable, particularly if you buy the brand-name version. But that's just priming you for the real unpleasantness, which comes when you eat anything else.</div>
<div class="line">It's a little hard to describe the taste that results. The best I've been able to come up with is &quot;hollandaise sauce made with rotten eggs and 9-volt batteries&quot;. It's like the experience a vulture must have when eating a cyborg's carcass.</div>
<div class="line">Why the sudden, food-triggered onset? I have no idea. Maybe the change in flavor wakes up neurons that have grown inured to the original zinc drop. Maybe the acid in the food makes the zinc rust out of solution, producing a different and worse-tasting compound (chemistry nerds, help me out here). Whatever it is, it seems to be unavoidable, regardless of how much water and time you place between the lozenge and the food. It's the taste of wellness, and it's terrible.</div>

                    <p>Two recent blog posts that caught my eye:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">Dave Winer <a class="reference external" href="http://www.scripting.com/2006/11/28.html#bubbleBurst20">says</a> that a plummeting Google stock price will be the surest sign that the web 2.0 bubble has collapsed. Seems plausible to me — nothing lasts forever, right? But it's not all going away. Sure, there are people who think that learning to use the Google Maps API constitutes a meaningful contribution to society, and they are in for a rude awakening. But Google will still be around, as will Yahoo, as will well-developed Javascript technologies and the open-API concept that have powered Web 2.0.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
</li>
<li><p class="first">On the other hand, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.blogmaverick.com/2006/11/28/a-little-ditty-about-web-video-and-hdtv/">this</a> Mark Cuban post is dead wrong. Cuban argues that the growth of HDTV and simultaneous lack of hi-def outputs on PCs means that downloadable video will be unable to power our home entertainment centers, preserving the status quo distribution system. This is really dumb.
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITV_(Apple)">Apple's iTV</a> isn't yet released, but it's aimed at solving <em>exactly</em> the problem Cuban describes — and, like so many Apple products, will get us all used to a new way of interacting with technology (just in time for cheaper competitors to swoop in). Soon enough we'll all get cheap(ish) network appliances with HD outputs that can stream video wirelessly from our PCs — either from shared drives, or from DRM-preserving server applications that we'll leave running on our desktops.
Initially these boxes will be standalone devices, but soon enough the functionality will be integrated into DVD players or cable boxes or stereo receivers — just like Tivo's revolutionary DVR functionality has been. In fact, you don't have to wait for the iTV to see this happen: you can already see the low-end version on <a class="reference external" href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/mediacenter/extender/owner/mcxkit.mspx">on the Xbox 360</a>, the high end in devices like <a class="reference external" href="http://www.neodigits.com/new/body/products/Xline/x5000.asp">this</a>, and the midrange option <a class="reference external" href="http://www.afterdawn.com/news/archive/7656.cfm">here</a>.
Sure, we might have to wait for 802.11n to reliably stream 1080p HD content. And I have no idea whether the tech will end up residing in your DVD player, cable box, TV or receiver — at the moment I'd say the DVD player, since it's mostly cheap DVD players from Asia that have brought DivX playback to the living room. But then, that's what I said <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolby_5.1">the last time</a>, and I was dead wrong (Dolby decoding chipsets are now expected to live in the receiver). Plus, the need to preserve DRM makes partnerships between large online media vendors like Apple, Microsoft and (soon) Walmart and players like Comcast seem pretty likely. So maybe it'll be your cable box that does the streaming. Beats me.
But although the specifics are a little hazy, I <em>am</em> completely sure that Cuban is wrong about this. Downloadable video is going to be coming to the living room — and in hi-def — a lot sooner than he thinks. Thanks to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.xboxmediacenter.com/info_project.htm">Xbox Media Center</a> it's already present in mine. I just don't have a TV that can display it.</p>

<div class="line">Well, I hate to be a downer. But I <a class="reference external" href="http://www.andysullivan.com/blog/?p=236">have</a> to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.dcist.com/archives/2006/11/27/what_did_you_th_1.php#comments">disagree</a>: I thought the Hold Steady were merely Pretty Good on Saturday. As great as the new album is, as raucous as the guitars sounded, as joyous as the band was, there were some problems.</div>
<div class="line">First, and predictably, the Black Cat sound: it was lousy, as usual. The keyboards on this last record are more important than they have been before, but they were nearly inaudible whenever the guitars were going. Sucky, sucky, sucky.</div>
<div class="line">Second and more importantly, by the end of the show Craig Finn seemed more than a little drunk. That can be fine and charming, but this time, and to this curmudgeon, it wasn't. His tossed-off alternate phrasings got grating, particularly during a downright Shatnerian performance of &quot;Hot Soft Light&quot;. I'm all for changing up arrangements during a live show, but this was closer to Duritz than Dylan.</div>
<div class="line">But I don't mean to complain too much. It may not have been as enjoyable as <a class="reference external" href="http://www.zunta.org/blog/archives/2006/02/02/pygs_at_the_doo/">last February's concert</a>, but it was still a good show by a great band. I'm glad I went, but I would've been pretty pissed off if I'd been one of the people who got beer sprayed on them. But then, I <em>am</em> approximately a million years old. Consarnit.</div>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>I'm embarrassed to admit that I initially clicked through to <a class="reference external" href="http://hardware.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=06/11/26/140240&amp;from=rss">this story</a> with interest rather than incredulity. In short: some guy claimed he had come up with a means of storing 450 gigabytes of data on a single sheet of paper through a special encoding system involving colored geometric shapes. Some of the tech press ran with it.</p>
<p>Well, it's <a class="reference external" href="http://itsoup.blogspot.com/2006/11/scam-of-indian-student-developing.html">bullshit</a>, but that link doesn't really adequately explain why. It gets close, though. Here's my stab at an explanation, just for fun.</p>
<p>A laser printer can manage about 1800 dots per linear inch <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dots_per_inch">according to Wikipedia</a>. Treating each of those dots as a bit, that's 3,240,000 bits/inch<sup>2</sup>. Assuming no margins, 8.5&quot; * 11&quot; * 3,240,000 bits/inch<sup>2</sup> = a measly 302,940,000 bits, or about 295.8 megabytes (depending on which definition of megabyte you use). Allow for printing in different colors and you can multiply that by four, topping a gigabyte. Assume some sort of advanced printing technology that mixes colors in a way that provides each printed dot with 24 bits of color information like your computer screen (instead of just dithering dots of different colors to mix colors), and you're still stuck under 8 gigs/sheet.</p>
<p>At this point it's tempting to believe that the inventor's system of polygons introduces some sort of magic storage benefit. But it doesn't — fully compressed data looks like noise, not polygons, and pretty encoding schemes are doomed to be less efficient than ones that simply get down to the business of shoveling bits around. Think about how much data it takes to reproduce a colored triangle. There are probably more efficient ways to do it, but at a first glance it seems to me that you could accomplish it by storing two angles, the length of the longest side, and the color (for now, let's ignore how it's oriented in space on the page). The resolution and range you choose for these determines your ultimate storage requirements, but a reasonable guess would be 4 bytes for each number and 3 more for the color. Those 15 bytes comprise the descriptive capacity of that triangle — the rest of it can be figured out from those pieces of data, and consequently would be redundant to store. So, what's going to be a more efficient way of representing those 15 bytes? Drawing the triangle? Or using 0.00003704 square inches of paper to print 15 bytes?</p>
<p>Anyway, this is far from the first data compression scam (have a look at the fourth letter <a class="reference external" href="http://www.dansdata.com/danletters165.htm">in this Dan's Data column</a>). It's not anything novel — I just find this stuff strangely fascinating. And it provides a handy opportunity for me to resume my periodic evangelism for <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Information-Theory-John-Pierce/dp/0486240614/sr=8-2/qid=1164577747/ref=pd_bbs_sr_2/002-0432362-5412058?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books">this book</a>, which is short, accessible, and capable of teaching you important things about how technology works. The principles of information theory are just as important to understanding the online world as, say, conservation of energy is to understanding the physical world. At the very least, they're a big help when relatives ask you to expound in an authoritative-sounding manner about their planned digital camera purchases.</p>

<div class="line">As far as I can recall, there is no candy bar on the national market that contains raisins. None of even moderate prominence, anyway. The closest you can come is Nestle's generally-underrated <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cybercandy.co.uk/search/index1.php/url_indprod/xdbc_2">Chunky</a> product, but its length:(width+height) ratio is all off — it's some sort of ill-conceived candy chimera.

<div class="line">Now, I'm not noting this to argue for raisins as a primary candy bar component — I know that proposition would be controversial. Still, you have to admit that raisins are a classic confection ingredient; a solid, dependable utility player. Yet the candy bar industry systematically ignores them. Meanwhile, various other ingredients — the poorly-defined &quot;nougat&quot; in particular — seem to me to be consistently over-represented. I don't know exactly what's going on, but it's virtually guaranteed to be sinister.</div>

                    <p>Via <a class="reference external" href="http://artiloop.blogspot.com">Michael</a>, check out <a class="reference external" href="http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061119/NEWS03/611190639">this article</a> about a high school kid who built a machine capable of producing nuclear fusion. Pretty cool stuff. And pretty abysmal reporting:</p>
<blockquote>
Thiago Olson, 17, stands near his nuclear fusion reactor, which he calls &quot;the Fusor,&quot; at home in Oakland Township on Friday.</blockquote>
<p>That's, um, because it <em>is</em> a <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusor">Fusor</a>. It's not like he just made a stencil and spray-painted a cool-sounding name onto his soapbox racer.</p>
<blockquote>
Thiago's mom, Natalice Olson, initially was leery of the project, even though the only real danger from the fusion machine is the high voltage and small amount of X-rays emitted through a glass window in the vacuum chamber -- through which Olson videotapes the fusion in action..</blockquote>
<p>Mrs. Olson probably should've stuck with her first instinct. From what I've read, the voltages and x-rays involved are both excellent ways to kill yourself and your family (I think there's some danger from neutron radiation, too). But presumably (and hopefully) Thiago learned how to build shielding for the gadget sometime during its construction.</p>
<blockquote>
&quot;Originally, he wanted to build a hyperbolic chamber,&quot; she said, adding that she promptly said no. But, when he came asking about the nuclear fusion machine, she relented.</blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Is that the right quote? Really? Because all I'm turning up on the internet for &quot;hyperbolic chamber&quot; are references to the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_Time_Chamber">Hyperbolic Time Chamber</a> from the awesome yet completely uneventful anime <em>Dragonball Z</em>. Honestly, if it was between one of those and a Fusor, I'd have pushed the kid toward the time machine.</div>
<div class="line">I guess it's a little silly to nitpick. This is a human interest story, not real science reporting, so it's not that important that Ms. Damron get things right. Still, I don't really understand why reporters don't bother to run things by experts — or at least wikipedia — when they're writing about technical areas in which they're not conversant. The likelihood of embarrassing errors seems high. So why not call up a physics professor from the local community college and read him or her the piece over the phone? I bet she'd be happy to do it so long as you used a quote from her.</div>
<div class="line">Anyway, questionable coverage aside, this kid is clearly pretty awesome, and he has now officially replaced <a class="reference external" href="http://www.dangerouslaboratories.org/radscout.html">David Hahn</a> as my all-time favorite teenage nuclear hacker. These kids' willingness to leapfrog straight into playing with lethal radioactivity is awe-inspiring. I'm still working up toward accidentally killing myself with mains power, for pete's sake.</div>
