                    <p>Slashdot <a class="reference external" href="http://hardware.slashdot.org/hardware/08/05/06/2032216.shtml">posted</a> something yesterday; today I gave it a try. Apparently the <a class="reference external" href="http://chdk.wikia.com/wiki/CHDK">CHDK project</a> allows you to supplement your Canon camera's firmware. The modified software allows you to override the rather constrained exposure times and ISO settings, and do other fun things like shoot in RAW, trigger exposures via USB, record longer movies and even set the camera up to take pictures whenever it detects motion. There are also a few less useful applications thrown in:</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/2473392789/"><img alt="playing reversi, compliments of CHDK" class="center" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3248/2473392789_48512f6896.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: 375px;" /></a></p>
<p>Reversi! Neat.</p>
<p>Installation is pretty painless: after figuring out your camera's firmware revision, you download and copy two files to the root directory of your SD card. Then boot into picture-viewing mode and go to the &quot;update firmware&quot; menu option. Despite what this sounds like, it's all reversible: by default you'll have to repeat the operation every time you turn the camera on. And even if you set it to automatically boot, you can always revert to the stock firmware by deleting the files from the memory card.</p>
<p>My geriatric SD400 is juuuust below the cutoff for official distributions, but a little searching turned up a <a class="reference external" href="http://chdk.wikia.com/wiki/SD400">beta release</a> that seems to work fine. If your camera isn't listed as being supported, use the wiki's search function.</p>
<p>I'm afraid that my camera hasn't got enough life left in it to really make good use of this new photographic freedom — the focus hasn't been great ever since some sand got into it at the beach. But knowing that these capabilities exist makes me virtually certain to buy another Canon when I finally decide to replace it.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>So! Let's talk about what I've been working on. I wasn't very good about documenting my WMATA picture frame build. This time I'm aspiring to do a better job.</p>
<p>At the moment I'm working on getting a 10x20 array of LEDs working. I haven't completely made up my mind about what I'm going to use it to display, but it'll be something that can be hung on the wall, I think. At the moment there are two parts to the project.</p>
<p>First is the array of LEDs. I'm using a sheet of pegboard for spacing; last night I began soldering them together. As you can see, I still have a lot of work ahead of me. I installed 70 LEDs last night over the course of two or three hours (admittedly, with breaks for dinner and the expression of my very important opinions regarding American Idol). That's 35% of the total number.</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/2473114747/"><img alt="miles to go..." class="center" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3276/2473114747_7ed146e1bb.jpg" style="width: 375px; height: 500px;" /></a></p>
<p>Each hole in the board has an LED, to which a resistor is attached. The anodes of every LED in a row are electrically unified; the cathodes in every column will be, too. This lets me avoid having to use 200 individual on/off connections. Instead I'll rely on persistence of vision: each row will be powered up in sequence, and during that period each column will be switched on or off. One row — ten LEDs — will be illuminated at any given instant. By flipping through rows very quickly the display will appear to be continuously on. Our retinas are stupid that way.</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/2473934182/"><img alt="closeup of the assembly" class="center" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2208/2473934182_d09f376304.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: 375px;" /></a></p>
<p>The advantage gained by this is that I only need 30 connections instead of 200. That's an improvement — much less soldering! — but still more connections than the Arduino has to offer.</p>
<p>So, to expand the available connections (which I should really be calling pins, and will be from here on out) I'll be using four daisy-chained five-bit shift registers. These are integrated circuits that require various connections — power, ground, and some others supporting optional functions that I'm not using — but the real action happens on the chips' input and clock pins. You set the input pin to a desired value; you then flip the clock pin on and off. The chip then remembers the value that was on the input pin, and begins displaying it on its first output pin. If you do the same thing, the originally-remembered value is moved to the second output pin, and the new input value takes the first position. In this way you can shift bits down the line — and by connecting one chip's final output to another's input, you can make the line arbitrarily long. Voila: as many output pins as you need, all at the cost of a mere two Arduino output pins.</p>
<p>The video below is a proof-of-concept for this commonly-used idea — it's just my effort to make sure I know what I'm doing before I start making irreversible soldered connections. The Boarduino (the thing with the blinking red light) is connected to the first shift register (the chip closest to the Boarduino), and set to send four ON signals, then four OFF signals (distinguishing the divisions between each one by flipping the clock signal, which is indicated by the flashing red LED).</p>
<p>In the actual device each shift register output will provide power to an entire row's anodes — there will only be one ON bit at a time, and it will travel down the twenty outputs in sequence. This is why there are transistors in the setup, too: the shift register could provide enough current for a single LED, but ten would be pushing it. The transistor allows a very small current from the shift register to switch on a much larger current.</p>
<p>Electronically astute readers might be asking themselves why I'm going to the trouble of attaching 200 resistors (and for my electronically non-astute readers: the resistors are necessary to keep the LEDs from consuming too much current and burning out). After all, if only ten LEDs will actually be on at a time, why not just have ten resistors — one for each column?</p>
<p>There are a couple of reasons, most of them related to a lack of confidence in my ability to keep just one row enabled, particularly during the debugging process. First, in general it's a bad idea to have LEDs sharing resistors. If one LED fails the other one may suddenly experience twice the current you had intended, and will also fail immediately. Second, the resistors are rated for a half-watt of power dissipation. Each LED consumes about 30 milliwatts; if an entire column is illuminated, that'd put me 20% over spec for the resistors. I probably could've gotten away with shared resistors in this case, but I'm still sufficiently unsure of what I'm doing that I didn't want to risk it. Besides, all that additional soldering will build character.</p>

                    <p>So where can I sign up for more timely updates from the media conspiracy? I'm imagining an email list. Or maybe a dashboard widget with Growl notifications telling me when and how to unfairly marginalize the Ron Paul campaign.</p>
<p>When I went to bed last night, MSNBC had begun expressing doubts about Senator Clinton's prospects. But that was it! By this morning the floodgates had opened and suddenly everyone is willing to acknowledge what has been true for weeks: that there's really no way for her to catch up that doesn't involve people taking to the streets. It really is striking, bizarre, and a bit frightening to see how suddenly, uniformly and arbitrarily this change occurred. The most generous interpretation is that after one or two people risked embarrassment by acknowledging the actual situation, everyone else felt free to adopt the new storyline.</p>
<p>Without the fourth estate to help it play make-believe, I guess it's unlikely that the Clinton campaign is long for this world. That's fine by me. But I'm still a little bitter: I'd gotten pretty good at writing rote, despairing <a class="reference external" href="http://dcist.com/2008/05/07/morning_roundup_252.php">morning roundup</a> introductions about the primary campaign's interminability. When I woke up this morning and rescanned the headlines I had to throw away a rather clever paragraph. Sucks!</p>
<p>So please: a little more warning next time the media conspiracy suddenly and arbitrarily shifts direction — those of us at the distant bottom of the org chart would really appreciate it. Maybe you guys could set up a Google Calendar or something.</p>

<p>Exciting! I have to admit that the Avengers aren't really a franchise I enjoy. Norse gods? Archers? It's kind of weak, and their rogue's gallery is even worse. The arbitrary combination of dissimilar characters ends up robbing each of their archetypal punch.</p>
<p>But I suppose the Ultimates titles have breathed some life into the comic world, and lord knows that the further our society moves toward exclusively serving the tastes of teenage boys the wiser and more culturally relevant I seem. So my official position is one of support.</p>
<p>Relatedly: I forgot to mention it when it debuted, but check it out — I'm momentarily famous:</p>
<p>I <em>knew</em> there was a reason I saved that Halloween costume (besides, of course, the frankly embarrassing amounts of time and money that went into it). I just wish someone had told me that my hood was billowing inappropriately. Anyway, many thanks to <a class="reference external" href="http://pygmalioninablanket.blogspot.com">the Nabob</a> for inviting me to be a part of the filming.</p>

When something exists theoretically for decades before it becomes possible to fabricate; when it has implications for the fundamental ways a discipline explains its workings; and when, so shortly after its announced discovery, it's already been integrated into functioning systems: these are all reasons to be excited. It'll be a while before we come up with metaphors that can describe what the hell these things do in a way that makes intuitive sense to you and me, but it's not too early to recognize that, if the claims associated with memristors are true, their discovery is of immense importance.</p>
<p>Incidentally, it may seem as though I'm being a bit credulous about this seemingly huge upheaval in the world of fundamental electronics. Maybe I am, but I have a reason: the way we teach and understand the physics underlying electronic systems is totally screwed up.</p>
<p>It's all Ben Franklin's fault: not only was he a total jerk to John Adams (apparently), he also guessed the direction of electricity wrong. He thought it went from positive to negative, but in fact the electrons involved travel in the other direction. But by the time we had figured that out, enough progress had been made under the original explanatory framework that everyone just said &quot;what the hell&quot; and plunged onward. We still talk and teach and diagram as if current flows from positive to negative. And it works! But in order to make it work we've had to fool ourselves into thinking virtually every component in a circuit works the opposite way that it actually does. Fortunately once you reach a certain level of abstraction it becomes easy to ignore the situation, and eventually it recedes from your attention and ceases to be confusing.</p>
<p>But it's still a bit appalling, which makes it easy for me to believe that the discipline has overlooked fundamental truths in the way that Prof. Chua alleges in <a class="reference external" href="http://www.informationweek.com/news/hardware/processors/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=207403582&amp;pgno=1&amp;queryText=&amp;isPrev=">the article</a>.

                    <p><a class="reference external" href="http://meganmcardle.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/05/false_contempt.php">Okay</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/ezraklein_archive?month=05&amp;year=2008&amp;base_name=and_ill_take_some_contempt_on">I</a> <a class="reference external" href="http://matthewyglesias.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/05/outback_strikes_back.php">agree</a>: the New York Times treating a visit to a chain restaurant like some sort of sociological safari is a pretty irritating premise for an article. And as a child of the DC suburbs whose family very, very rarely dined out, I'm not sure what kind of claim I have to this conversation. I eat a lot of arugula (it's good!), which I think probably at least partially disqualifies me.</p>
<p>But I do think we need to establish some reasonable limits on the anti-NYT populism that's currently pouring forth from the blogosphere. Because let's be honest: Outback Steakhouse is fucking disgusting. Admittedly, I've only been once. But what kind of steakhouse doesn't ask how you want your steak cooked? I honestly can't even tell you what kind of animal provided the steak I ate. It sure didn't <em>seem</em> like beef.</p>
<p>Now it's true that I'm a fan of the &quot;big greasy fried onion thing&quot; school of culinary thought. But <a class="reference external" href="http://www.redhotanblue.com/MENU.HTM">others</a> do it so much better. Add in Fosters' claim to the worst hangover:pleasing taste ratio in the beer industry, and you can see that the entire Fauxstralian concept has little to redeem it.</p>
<p>But the other chain restaurants in that article are fine. Alright, I admit to having a grudge against the Cheesecake Factory, largely on the basis of their strangely mosquelike Clarendon location (and the perpetual lines outside it) serving as a constant local reminder of the American Empire's impending collapse. And I find something a little off-putting about Olive Garden's explicitly stated promotional campaign: &quot;Come fill up on bread!&quot; But Chili's, Bertucci's, Friday's, P.F. Chang's and Applebee's are all fine (I've never eaten at a Red Lobster, but a recent Tivo subscription to &quot;Deadliest Catch&quot; is making me want to).</p>
<p>There's nothing wrong with these places' recipes, per se, other than their inability to power pretentious foodie smalltalk and their depressing implications re: our country's per capita alfredo sauce consumption. With the cost spread over millions of diners, I believe these chains are probably willing to invest seriously in coming up with dishes that are about as good as possible given the constraints of their supply chain, price range and varying levels of kitchen talent.</p>
<p>But I can understand why they have a bad reputation — and it isn't just snobbery. The difference is really just about which restaurant in the chain you visit. If you find one with a good manager, chances are you'll get decent service and decent food. If you go to one that isn't as well run — the Chili's I last visited comes to mind (it was located in some airport) — every bite will make you acutely aware of how little care went into your meal between the walk-in and your plate.</p>
<p>The power of the brand means that a bad restaurant that belongs to a franchise can stay in business much longer than a bad restaurant that belongs to a person could; which means that if you find a bad one it'll probably seem <em>particularly</em> bad. I think it's that phenomenon — our automatic capacity for mindless brand loyalty — that makes the chains seem unappealing rather than any designed aspect of the dining experiences on offer.</p>

                    <p>It's May, the sun is out, and it seems likely that something, somewhere, is germinating. Clearly, the time has come for Album of the Summer deliberations to begin. Naturally, this will not be the <em>only</em> album of the summer. But, still, a decision must be reached. When you're in your twilight years, what album (delivered via networked cochlear implant) do you want to use to dredge up lost memories of summer '08 from beneath a river of amyloid plaque?</p>
<p>As you can see, it's a weighty decision. It needs to be something that's widely acceptable, that's fun and sunny, and that still sounds good when drowned out by a blender.</p>
<p>The album I've been hearing people talk about most is the new Portishead. Pitchfork called it &quot;darker and bleaker&quot;, &quot;abrasive&quot; and &quot;jittery&quot;. The first paragraph notwithstanding, this is not exactly what I'm looking for in a soundtrack for sunburning myself.</p>
<p>I have considered other candidates and found them wanting:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cut Copy — Too much Hot Chip disco bullshit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dodos — I'm sorry, but I can no longer take seriously any acoustic guitar duos that don't have their own HBO series.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Wombats — I love these guys, but as their releases inched closer to the US they've gotten more and more overproduced. Their latest LP incarnation is essentially unlistenable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the new Hold Steady — Grudgingly disqualified due to non-existence.</p>
<p>I do, however, have a nomination to make: <a class="reference external" href="http://www.headlightsmusic.com/">Headlights</a>, an Illinois band that released <em>Some Racing, Some Stopping</em> at the beginning of March (Kyle was <a class="reference external" href="http://www.informationleafblower.com/blog/archives/2008/01/friday-linkage.html">on top of it</a> then). The album's first two tracks are the real standouts: <a class="reference external" href="http://hypem.com/search/get+your+head+around+it/1/">Get Your Head Around It</a> is a reverbed song about regret that slowly builds to an aching, harmony-filled crescendo. You may recall <a class="reference external" href="http://www.google.com/search?q=holy%20shit%20I%20love%20the%20wrens">how I feel about such things</a>.</p>
<p>More universally, <a class="reference external" href="http://hypem.com/search/cherry%20tulips/1/">Cherry Tulips</a> is likely to be among the prettiest things you hear this spring, suffering only from some unfortunately lame rhymes in the chorus. It's still awfully sweet, though.</p>
<p>The rest of the album is worthwhile, too. The obvious comparison is to Rilo Kiley circa <em>Execution of All Things</em>. But it's better than that: the band uses dynamics less clumsily, the sequencing on the album is actually well thought-out, and they have the good sense to keep every song under four minutes.</p>
<p>Pitchfork gave it <a class="reference external" href="http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/49082-some-racing-some-stopping">a pretty good review</a>, but one which amounted to saying, &quot;this is a good pop record, but it seems like we've had one of those before&quot;. That's the business they're in, and it's a correct evaluation. But for summertime music purposes, it's a bit beside the point.</p>

                    <p>From <a class="reference external" href="http://remakingleslumhistorique.blogspot.com/2008/04/thinking-about-teeter-effect.html">RenewShaw</a> (with apologies for quoting the full entry):</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">As a North Carolinian, I took for granted Harris Teeter grocery stores: they're clean, well-stocked (fresh, beautiful fruits and veggies, awesome delis, great meat departments, outstanding wine/beer departments, a variety of all the essentials and more), well-staffed, and generally pleasant shopping experiences. Since moving to D.C., I have relished the few opportunities I've had to grocery shop at Teets out in Virginia.</div>
<div class="line">As reported elsewhere, the District's first HT finally opened today yesterday in Adams Morgan. Boo-yah. Another one is set to open on the Hill soon, and yet another is planned for NoMa. I don't know if any of these Tajma Teeters will ever be a routine grocery stop for me, but it's exciting to have them in the city, and hopefully they will inspire other grocers (Safeway and Giant) to take a hard look at how they do business.</div>
<div class="line">That said, I've had positive experiences at the Shaw Giant lately. While the store has some definite shortcomings due to its limited space (e.g., the produce department is woefully lacking, the place is generally unattractive and uninviting), I've not encountered lines stretching to the back of the store lately and have generally experienced helpful people at the checkouts.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>All true! I live right by that Giant, and over the last year or two it really has improved: the staff is better trained, they've introduced some yuppie-compatible brands (look, an organic section!), and the produce is at least <em>less</em> rotten.</p>
<p>But it's a mistake, albeit an easy one, to assume that every store in a chain is the same. Of the proletarian grocery companies I've encountered, Giant has had both the nicest and worst stores. I've been to Safeways that look like fallout shelters, and others that are gleaming temples built for the greater glory of the deli counter. So far Harris Teeters seem to be consistently nice, but they're a relatively new player on the DC grocery scene. Wait twenty years, or head back to the region where they were founded. You'll find some atrocities.</p>
<p>Of course, this isn't to excuse the people responsible for the Shaw Giant. Actually, it makes them <em>more</em> culpable, because their crappy offerings are the result of deliberate inattention rather than simple incompetence. Grocery stores, like a lot of businesses, work like engines that the central office can rev up or rev down as economic circumstances dictate. I'm sure that Giant HQ noticed the percentage of WIC and EBT sales declining as I and my gentrifying ilk moved into the neighborhood. The better food and better-trained staff followed in due course.</p>
<p>So as long as the customers going to the new Harris Teeter are relatively rich, the store will be nice. As long as the ones shopping at the Shaw Giant are relatively poor, the store will be lousy. It's as simple as that, I'm afraid — the brands' individual virtues don't have much to do with it.</p>
<p>I do have another question about grocery stores, though. You hear constantly about how the industry operates with razor-thin margins, and survives only thanks to massive volume. But I've recently done a bunch of shopping at the Italian Market in Philly — a historic, year-round, daily open-air market that starts at Ninth and Christian and trickles down to the great cheesesteak palaces of the South. And the price difference is astounding. Three pounds of grapes cost $2. A dozen green peppers and two bags of onions cost less than $5. You can get five nice navel oranges for a dollar, and even more lemons.</p>
<p>Philly is a cheaper town than DC in general, but not <em>that</em> much cheaper — costs at Whole Foods and Superfresh are roughly comparable to the ones at Whole Foods and the Giant in Shaw. So can it really be the case that the cost of a roof, refrigeration and employee benefits is the difference? I guess so. The only other explanation I can come up with is that the mob is subsidizing my produce purchases in order to maintain their South Philly fronts.</p>

                    <p><a class="reference external" href="http://matthewyglesias.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/04/prepare_for_bikeblogging.php">Matt got a bike</a>! This is wonderful news. I'm a big cycling proponent, of course, and am very glad to see a friend take up this healthy and convenient hobby. The benefits are myriad: why, just this week I received a check compensating me for the repair bill incurred the last time I was hit by a car (true!). More to the point, though, I think neither Matt nor I are particularly patient people. Hopefully he will enjoy being freed from the torpor of his pathetic human limbs as much as I have.</p>
<p>Naturally Matt's commenters have a ton of advice for him, ranging from the stupefyingly obvious (you should use a lock!) to the idiotic (<a class="reference external" href="http://matthewyglesias.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/04/prepare_for_bikeblogging.php#comment-1978747">don't sweat the helmet, bro</a>) to the completely inane (<a class="reference external" href="http://matthewyglesias.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/04/prepare_for_bikeblogging.php#comment-1977834">you need fenders</a>(!?)). Allow me to add my own suggestions to the chorus:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Be prepared to adopt startlingly new ideas about the appropriateness of various traffic laws. This may be unsettling at first, but don't worry: you will quickly develop elaborate justifications for these opinions, many of them loudly based on your right to defend your safety, and many more quietly originating from your own preferences and convenience. The experience roughly approximates what I think it must be like to be an NRA member, except you're concerned with fending off regulatory challenges to your momentum rather than to your firearms.</li>
<li>Understand that your bike shop experience is about to get catastrophically worse. If you're anything like me, while shopping for a bike you probably had a chipper salesgirl show you around, distrac you from your ignorance and gently hint that maybe you two could go out after this major purchase, because, you know, she doesn't get to meet a lot of guys who know nothing about bikes in this job and she finds that really attractive. But your time in retail land is over, my friend.
From now on you'll be dealing with the maintenance department, and the experience is fraught. This is the only shopping experience I'm aware of where the customer is treated with more contempt than at a record store. It's understandable: the employees are highly skilled and in demand, yet <em>still</em> in dead-end jobs. Also, they're much, much cooler than you, and would prefer to hang out with the messengers milling around the repair counter instead of taking your money. My best advice is to find an older mechanic, as they tend to spend about 80% of their time on long disquisitions about bicycle repair, which is both kind of interesting and leaves them less time for staring at you disdainfully. Special bonus if you go to CityBikes: the guy there looks exactly like <a class="reference external" href="http://www.chrismclaren.com/blog/wp-content/images/2007/02/Alan_Moore.jpg">Alan Moore</a>!</li>
<li>It's best to live in constant fear of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.webmd.com/erectile-dysfunction/news/20050825/studies-link-bike-seats-erectile-dysfunction">what bicycling is doing to your sex life</a>. I've never experienced any ill effects, and given the small amount of biking I do I doubt I ever will. But it's a fantastic thing to worry about, particularly given its likelihood to result in your getting hit by a car while carefully fidgeting on your saddle.</li>
<li>Which reminds me: be prepared for other cyclists to call their bike seats &quot;saddles&quot;. I know, it's pretty annoying.</li>
<li>Maintenance tasks you can easily do yourself and probably should: fixing tires, replacing brake pads, tightening brakes, installing saddles and pedals, adjusting your shifting if it gets slightly unaligned. Things you can do but probably will be better off paying someone to do for you: replacing chains, replacing cables. Things that you can't do: true a wheel, perform a really good tune-up, or anything more complicated. After I post this my friend Chris will probably accost me in the hall and say, &quot;You can totally do all those things!&quot; But that is only true if you have someone like Chris on hand who is overly generous with his time and bike knowledge.</li>
</ol>
<p>Alright, this list is becoming dangerously practical. I'll stop right there. Enjoy your new freedom and speed! Oh, and the secret anti-pedestrian meetings are the first Tuesday of every month.</p>

                    <p>My apologies for using this forum for something as tedious as the following. But there seem to be some misconceptions about how our transportation system is supposed to work, and this seems like the most efficient way to get the word out:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first"><strong>To the operators of the Chinatown bus:</strong> If, after several years of continuous operation without imposing a numbered boarding system on your passengers, you suddenly decide to implement such a system, you should expect some confusion. This may be exacerbated if you tell passengers who go into your office to obtain such a number that they don't need one. And, when faced with the first passenger of those waiting who is denied passage on the bus — a handsome young man who is clearly frustrated but remains at least somewhat polite — you might consider offering him something other than your assurance that his ticket will work on tomorrow's bus. Although your sheepish facial expressions were at least somewhat appreciated.</p>
</p></li>

<p>Thanks for your attention, everybody. With a little practice I'm sure we can work out these kinks.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>One of the projects I've been fiddling with recently has been <a class="reference external" href="http://mobile.processing.org/">Mobile Processing</a>. You might remember me <a class="reference external" href="/2006/12/11/progressing-with-processing/">screwing around</a> with its parent project, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.processing.org">Processing</a>, in 2006. That project's cross-platform IDE and open ethos has spread to a number of other projects, including <a class="reference external" href="http://www.arduino.cc">Arduino</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.wiring.org.co/">Wiring</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.fritzing.org/">Fritzing</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://mobile.processing.org">Mobile Processing</a>. Of these, Mobile Processing is probably the most like Processing proper, in that it attempts to provide an easy-to-use environment for writing small applications that can display graphics, respond to input and manipulate system devices. The only difference is that Processing Mobile is designed to work on J2ME-capable mobile phones.</p>
<p>In Washington, DC, the cheapest compatible phone that I'm aware of is Boost Mobile's i425, a crappy candybar handset from Motorola's iDEN line. It costs $40, which includes activation and $5 worth of Boost credit. Better still, for thirty-some cents a day you get unlimited data access. It's a GSM phone — speed won't be great — but still: unlimited data! <strong>And</strong> it has GPS! Surely that's enough to excuse its bulk and awful, awful screen.</p>
<p>All that you have to do to get it working with Processing Mobile <a class="reference external" href="http://developer.motorola.com/">sign up for a free developer account with Motorola</a>, download their IDENJAL tool (Windows only, unfortunately), and then use it to load a Processing Mobile sketch's compiled Midlet onto the phone over USB.</p>
<p>With much greatly-appreciated assistance from the man himself, I've been trying to follow in the footsteps of <a class="reference external" href="http://five.b.oh.googlepages.com/">five.b.oh</a>, who successfully got a similar phone to speak to his Arduino over a serial connection. If I can succeed in replicating that effort, I think this will be the most economical means of getting the Arduino online from anywhere.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, five.b.oh's phone is a different model from mine. His is a little older, and still uses a straightforward serial cable — one that, with some voltage-shifting circuitry, is pretty easy to connect to an Arduino. The i425 is too clever for its own good, and hides its serial port behind a USB connection. I'm confident that there *is* a serial port, since its baud rate can be set through the phone's menu system (five.b.oh also supplied me with a sketch that enumerates system ports, which prompted the i425 to spit out &quot;COM0&quot; — that's a good sign). But how can I get to that serial signal? Unfortunately USB-to-serial cables won't work in this case, I believe, since they rely upon a USB host controller being on one end. Both the phone and the Arduino will be acting as USB clients.</p>
<p>So I disassembled the phone, hoping to find a silkscreened label pointing me to the serial signal somewhere upstream from the USB chip. That was wishful thinking. So I'm posting the photos here, and crossposting to some relevant forums in the hopes that someone with more electronics experience will be inspired to offer a suggestion. How do I proceed? Are there things I should be looking for? Something in these photographs that looks particularly promising? Do I need an oscilloscope, or can I just probe with the Arduino's serial RX pin (under the assumption that I can trust the baud rate set on the phone)? What's the best way to get those metal covers off of the PCB?</p>
<p>Any advice is much appreciated. These pictures are taken in order of disassembly: imagine the phone on a table facing you, with the keypad closest to you. The phone has a top screen section, and two layers of PCBs under the keypad. These fold up like the advancing pages of a calendar.</p>
<p>Click the images to get to their Flickr pages, which contain higher resolution versions and notes on various components that I'm able to identify.</p>

<p>If you're disassembling the phone yourself you'll need to remove a set of hex screws from the back (with back cover removed), then remove the front cover. At that point the keypad PCB can be carefully pulled up from the bottom of the handset — don't panic at the resistance, as there's a glob of adhesive goo there. There are a few more screws to contend with, and then the bottom PCB will lift up as well.</p>
<p>If this fails I plan to experiment with one-way communication to an Arduino by flashing the screen to encode data that can be detected by a phototransistor connected to the Arduino. But I'd rather have a clean serial connection.</p>

<p>On Tuesday night I successfully assembled a <a class="reference external" href="http://ladyada.net/make/boarduino/">Boarduino</a> kit for the first time. I had tried once before and accidentally swapped the two electrolytic capacitors — whoops. But I placed an order for a couple more kits, and their creator, Lady Ada, was even nice enough to send an extra one my way. Thanks!</p>
<p>The Arduino, as you might know from my earlier ramblings, is a microcontroller doohickey that can run tiny programs and read and write signals from its twenty or so connections. It can also talk to your computer over USB.</p>
<p>The Boarduino is pretty much the same thing. This is one of the benefits of the Arduino being an open platform: it can be freely copied. The Boarduino is just as open, as Lady Ada provides downloadable schematics that you can use to print your own circuit boards if you'd like.</p>
<p>There are a few differences between the Boarduino and a standard Arduino, though. First, it looks very different. That's because it's designed to be plopped into a breadboard, which is a commonly used mechanism for wiring up prototype circuits without soldering anything. Second, it's sold as a kit that has to be <a class="reference external" href="http://ladyada.net/make/boarduino/solder.html">assembled and soldered</a>, which makes it cheaper. Third, it moves the chip that translates from USB to serial (which the Arduino chip can understand) into a reusable cable instead of keeping it on the Arduino, which makes it cheaper still. This means that for applications where a connection to a computer is important, the Boarduino doesn't make that much sense.</p>
<p>But if your application stands on its own and you don't mind spending some time soldering the Boarduino is a great option. And a kit only costs $17.50 — about half as much as an assembled, full-featured Arduino.</p>

                    <p>If you know anything about my musical tastes at all, you know that I'm a fan of the Unicorns. God but I loved that band. This was a group whose first press photo was of <a class="reference external" href="/static/2008/04/15/unicorns_murdered.jpg">their brutal murder</a>, who wrote pop songs about ghosts and dying and getting famous and then some more ghosts, and who couldn't be bothered with verses and choruses because there was just too much great stuff to cram into each song. The first time I saw them they wore matching pink tuxedos and swung from the rafters.</p>
<p>The second time I saw them was months later, and they were much worse. The band played no encore and clearly had little interest in entertaining the crowd. Having the Arcade Fire open the show didn't help the band make a lasting impression, either. Not long after that the Unicorns broke up, leaving behind not much besides an album's worth of amazing songs.</p>
<p>There was hope, though: two thirds of the band, including (necessarily) one founding member split off to form a new group called Islands. Nick Diamonds (née Thorburn) and J'aime Tambeur seemed less crazy than Alden Penner, and perhaps just as talented. Two tracks leaked under the band's name, and (although I later learned they were written while the Unicorns were still together) I found them immensely encouraging — particularly this one:</p>
<blockquote>
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.manifestdensity.net/2008/04/14/Islands%20-%20Abominable%20Snow%20(early).mp3">Islands – Abominable Snow (early version)</a></blockquote>
<p>Nick Diamonds also put together <a class="reference external" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070703181458/http://www.vice-recordings.com/halloween/index.html">this</a>. And you know how I feel about that.</p>
<p>Eventually Islands released their debut album, and I kind of thought it stunk. Well, that's too harsh: it had a couple of good tracks, but it was mostly a disappointment. The songs just weren't that great. Hopefully it at least convinced some other Canadian bands to reconsider their planned cetacean-themed guest raps.</p>
<p>Now Islands' second album, <em>Arm's Way</em>, has leaked, and I'm glad to say it's much better. The songs are solid. But it's still kind of a letdown. Here, listen to the version of &quot;Abominable Snow&quot; that's included on it:</p>
<blockquote>
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.manifestdensity.net/2008/04/14/Islands%20-%20Abominable%20Snow%20%28Arm%27s%20Way%29.mp3">Islands – Abominable Snow (Arm's Way)</a></blockquote>
<p>I think it's fair to say that I am less likely to call a song overdone than most people. Have some strings available? Sure, lay em down! Horns? The more the merrier! And say, have you got enough people for the hand claps yet?</p>
<p>But this... this is bad. It's too long; it's got too much stuff; it has too little fun. And I'm afraid that the rest of the album is like it. The underlying songs are good, if generally a minute longer than they need to be. But the production is boring and the instrumentation frequently so uninspired as to be indistinguishable from a karaoke CD. The only person who consistently sounds like he's trying is Diamonds. And he only sounds like he's trying to sound like he's trying.</p>
<p>This isn't true of every song: the title track fares pretty well, and the band actually manages to let (slightly) loose during a too-cute Who reference on &quot;In The Rushes&quot; and during the sprawling &quot;Vertigo&quot;. But it's true on far too many of the songs.</p>
<p>In other words, it's exactly what I should have expected after reading Nick Diamonds <a class="reference external" href="http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/news/48677-islands-nick-thorburn-talks-iarms-wayi-side-projects">say this</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
I think in terms of the band, it's very solidified. I'm trying to think of the focus of the arrangements. It's way less off the cuff. The first record, we would invite people in, say &quot;yeah, what do you think?&quot;, and give them free reign. This is reigned in.</blockquote>
<p>I understand that the man is sick of having his new band compared to the Unicorns. That band was great, but it's over. But I do wish wish he'd move on to having another <em>band</em>, rather than just a bunch of musicians who play his songs. This album sounds like a very complicated demo tape.</p>
<p>But hey: it's much better than <em>Return to Sea</em>. It's even pretty good! It's just that given the pedigree involved, I was hoping for something extraordinary.</p>

I had kind of thrown up my hands a few years ago and decided to learn about electronics instead, but I think I'd like to be able to begin speaking meaningfully about this again.</p>
<p>My first question: what should I be reading? The last time I seriously checked into these issues I was thinking about buying <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Quest-Consciousness-Neurobiological-Approach/dp/0974707708/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1208196000&amp;sr=8-1">Christof Koch's book</a>, but I ended up getting distracted/discouraged by its price tag and length. Has anything with a similar level of sophistication and noteworthiness come out since then, or is it time to grit my teeth and see what Prof. Koch has to say?</p>

<p>Pretty totally sweet. City Veins, are you paying attention? You can skip to 0:52 if you're strapped for time.</p>
<p>I remember one assembly in middle school that featured something similar. For reasons still unknown to me an administrator had us all come to the auditorium and then said, basically, &quot;Children, this gentleman has built a laser harp. Please listen respectfully, and DO NOT GET INTO HIS VAN.&quot;</p>
<p>Then the laser harp guy bounded out and said &quot;Hi kids! I built this laser harp! If you think about it, that proves that you can do <em>anything you set your mind to</em>. But only if you stay off drugs! Now, who wants to hear a bad MIDI sample of an electric guitar?&quot;</p>
<p>Ah, laser harp guy. You poor bastard.</p>
<p><strong>UNRELATEDLY:</strong> Am I the only one who's found every single thing he's heard about the Newseum so far to be completely grotesque? But then, I suppose I've been down on the project ever since they scrapped the initial plans to build it high enough to reach into heaven.</p>
<p>(Yesterday, when all the network anchors interviewed Petraeus there, like high priests conducting sacred rites at their newly opened temple? Pretty bad.)</p>

                    <p>I realize I've already blogged about my <a class="reference external" href="/2008/03/26/dorkbot-dc-arduino-meet-fonera/">Arduino/Fonera project</a> far too much. But I don't think I've actually explained <em>what it does</em> in simple terms. If you're interested, a brief explanation of what it is and how it works is included in today's <a class="reference external" href="http://dcist.com/2008/04/10/transit_on_thur_27.php">DCist transit post</a>. Special bonus: mean comments at my expense!</p>
<p>Now I'll shut up about it. Up next: something filled with shift registers, LEDs and childhood nostalgia.</p>
<p>(Although <a class="reference external" href="http://www.tearsoffire.org/twiki/bin/view/Projects/SolarPendulum">this</a> looks like a fun (and cheap) project, too.)</p>
