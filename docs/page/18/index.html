                    <p>Tim <a class="reference external" href="http://timothyblee.com/?p=452">wades in</a> to the debate about robots replacing low-skilled workers. I don't think I <a class="reference external" href="/2009/08/09/will-machines-render-low-skilled-workers-useless/">made my case</a> as strongly as I could have, and consequently I can't resist responding, if only briefly.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>I didn't react to the &quot;cost of materials and energy&quot; argument as forcefully as I should have. I really, really, really don't think this is going to be an issue. Machines are <em>much</em> more efficient than humans -- that's sort of the whole point. It's not at all a subtle difference, but rather a massive leap (they don't call the first sweeping wave of automation a revolution for nothing). The price of technology continues to fall. And the energy costs we're talking about are slight: keeping a Roomba charged takes about <a class="reference external" href="http://www.treehugger.com/files/2008/12/this-or-that-roomba-versus-upright.php">a third as much power</a> as illuminating the lamp on your nightstand -- and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/C/AE_compact_fluorescent_lamp.html">that's if the lamp is using a compact fluorescent bulb</a>.</li>
<li>Tim's discussion of our hardwired preference for other humans is an interesting one. But I'm not sure this is a problem that will be as resistant to engineering as he thinks. Consider <a class="reference external" href="http://www.japantrendshop.com/paro-robotic-healing-seal-p-144.html">Paro, the robot seal</a>. By all accounts he works pretty well at soothing nursing home patients. Tim's probably right that people would prefer -- and pay for -- a human R.N. rather than Rosie the Robot in nursing scrubs. But if a suite of relatively simple assistive technologies is cheaper than either -- partially automated showers, biomonitors, pill reminders and the like -- they'll probably settle for that.</li>
</ol>
<p>Human labor remaining competitive with robots seems to assume that one of two things will happen.</p>
<p>First, wages for unskilled labor could be pushed even further down. Presumably this is supposed to happen as average income continues to rise. I'm not sure how this can be considered feasible, either practically or ethically -- we're basically talking about reinventing the serf.</p>
<p>Second, robots could become dramatically less economical due to some sort of resource or energy shock. But given robotic efficiency (and the reality of their still-falling prices), it's hard for me to envision this happening except in the sort of catastrophic scenario in which maintaining human employment levels would be the least of our worries.</p>

                    <p><img alt="image1" class="alignright" src="/static/2009/08/18/skitched-20090818-220659.jpg" style="width: 234px; height: 350px;" />There's an interesting discussion of <em>District 9</em> happening in <a class="reference external" href="http://attackerman.firedoglake.com/2009/08/17/what-secrets-lurk-within-district-9-white-anxiety/">Spencer's comment section</a>. Rather than respond inline, I figured I'd blog it and see if the navel-gazing contagion can't be made to spread further.</p>
<p>First: <a class="reference external" href="http://www.grammarpolice.net">Kriston</a> is <a class="reference external" href="http://attackerman.firedoglake.com/2009/08/17/what-secrets-lurk-within-district-9-white-anxiety/#comment-12619">bothered</a> by the film's formal conceit, or lack thereof:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For structural reasons the film can’t tell us what it wants us to know. They did a bad job deciding about whether it was a compilation of footage or an omniscient film. The move slips at its own convenience between heroic presentation and after-the-fact video artifact, which threatens the integrity of the premise but, much worse, leaves us kind of stranded as viewers. Is this supposed to be a reliable presentation of the facts? Or is it a highly edited, manicured presentation a la Starship Troopers?</p>
<p>[...]Blomkamp has established this narrator through whom all motives must be filtered. Because it isn’t supposed to be a filmed movie in a cinematic sense but an edited compilation of video artifacts. Presumably some post-MNU bureaucracy or media outfit is stitching together all these clips: Perhaps, in light of events and revelations at the end of the film, press were able to acquire access to extraordinary video accounts and so on. I don’t know — it’s really confusing to figure out who’s talking.</p>
<p>The structural aspects notwithstanding (which really ruined the film for me) I thought it was a negative racist message encoded within a positive racial message. As if the film were saying, “Yes, this is a film about positive mutual understanding between black and white Africans. No-no—not Nigerians, no. You know how they are.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm sympathetic to the complaints about the film's structure. At times I found myself wondering what medium I was supposed to imagine myself to be watching. Ultimately, I concluded that the filmmakers had taken the smart way out by simply declining to answer the question. Why make yourself a slave to a form? If the payoff to adhering to documentarian pretense is greater than the payoff of the available dramatic alternatives, fine. But in this case Blomkamp decided it was better to, say, show Wikus hiding in the tall grass, or to frame him with a close-up in the middle of a firefight, than to preserve the fake-documentary format. So that's what Blomkamp did — but, interestingly, he didn't then force himself to surrender the documentary trappings that allowed gigantic hunks of exposition go down (relatively) smoothly. The result doesn't make a lot of formal sense, but I think it's evidence of Blomkamp's properly-set priorities, and is therefore basically fine. There are some movies that are almost exclusively about their form — Blair Witch, Spinal Tap — and for them to step outside of the rules of the game would be disastrous. But this isn't such a film.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The question of the movie's Nigerian thugs is one I feel more sheepish about addressing. But if their inclusion bothers us, I have to wonder what an acceptably enlightened alternate portrayal would have looked like.&nbsp; My guess: pretty lame.</p>
</p><p>No one seems to be questioning the plausibility of a criminal enterprise emerging to prey upon the residents of District 9. So are we bothered by that operation's ethnic uniformity? That doesn't seem right — gangs only tend to be multiethnic melting pots in after-school specials and Jackie Chan movies. Are we bothered by the ruling warlord's embrace of abhorrent, primitive beliefs in the form of Muti rituals? Well, alright, but <a class="reference external" href="http://news.scotsman.com/latestnews/Muti-killing-suspect-deported-to.2380656.jp">Muti is a real thing</a> (click the link, that story's got killing for body parts, identifies Muti as South African, and involves a Nigerian). And of course warlords have adopted <a class="reference external" href="http://www.slate.com/id/2086490/">strange</a> mystical <a class="reference external" href="http://www.time.com/time/asia/magazine/2001/0129/thai.burma.html">beliefs</a> before (and no, by that first link I do not mean to conflate vastly distant and different African cultures within a single, oversimplified continental bin — but the point that bad, ignorant people can subscribe to bad, ignorant religious beliefs shouldn't be particularly controversial).</p>
<p>So, given that the film also features a number of black Africans behaving like normal human beings — though admittedly in this movie that's faint praise; and admittedly they do so without much screen time — I'm not sure how upset we should be at the portrayal of the Nigerian gang in the movie. Certainly I don't agree with Spencer that &quot;you could tell the morality play of District 9 entirely without [the Nigerians]&quot; — they're necessary to make a point about the weak preying on the weaker, and to hold up a mirror to the civilized facade of MNU.</p>
<p>But of course that's all pretty easy for me to say. And all of the preceding assumes that establishing plausibility (relative to the universe of the movie) is the same as a get-out-of-jail-free card.&nbsp; I'm not sure that's right.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The third thing to discuss is Peter's theory, relayed by Spencer, that <em>District 9</em> could represent the dawn of competent videogame filmmaking*; in the same way that the comic book movie crawled from the muck over the past decade, <em>District 9</em> could be the first of a set of movies to successfully translate games to film.</p>
</p><p>I think it's likely that Peter is right about how history will judge the question, but I think that judgment will be unjustified. Games are now an enormous industry, and it's inevitable that their brands will eventually be slapped on some films sufficiently well-made to distract from the fact that the underlying properties are all shameless ripoffs of Tolkien, Aliens and/or Blade Runner. But I think it's basically incoherent to talk about adapting a game for the screen. You might as well talk about adapting a breakfast cereal. Sure, Count Chockula could (and no doubt will) eventually show up at the multiplex. But would that have anything to do with cereal? I don't think it makes sense to approach the question that way.</p>
<p>It'll really just be the games' trappings that are adapted; the movies will have nothing to do with the essential thing that makes a videogame a videogame. Yes, you can buy a disc and put it in your Xbox and interact with it and see a great story (though the odds of this happening are extremely slim). But the &quot;great story&quot; part is really a separate artifact from the interactive component that defines the game. Virtually all genuinely good in-game storytelling happens when the user is bolted to his or her seat, temporarily removed from the decisions or tests of skill that make up the bulk of the entertainment.</p>
<p>Games' settings, characters and plots will be shuttled to the screen — we'll have lame quests, hackneyed sci-fi settings, enchanted swords and cursed hands aplenty. But those things are just window dressing for the actual play mechanic. They could just as easily exist in a comic or a novel or a Saturday morning cartoon. The essential <em>game</em> aspect of the thing won't be translated, except via the occasional ill-advised moment of fanservice (e.g. <em>Doom</em>'s first person camera shots).</p>
<p>I don't think the situation is the same for comic books — partly by convention and partly due to the format, certain types of stories, characters and storytelling techniques lend themselves to that medium. &quot;Comic book movies&quot; is therefore a somewhat more meaningful concept than &quot;videogame movies&quot; is likely to turn out to be. There's just much less overlap between what defines a good game and what defines a good movie than there is between what makes a good comic and what makes a good film. &quot;Lots of dialogue and action&quot; is a more helpful constraint for a creator than &quot;the protagonist needs to be able to recover health at various points in the story for no good reason&quot;.</p>
<p>I say all this as a fan of videogames. But I'm increasingly of the opinion that those looking forward to the dawn of great storytelling in games are kidding themselves. Games tend to tell great stories when they're at their least game-like; and when they do, the parts of the game that linger tend to distract from the narrative experience. Perhaps some day the desire for genuine self-determination can be married to the framework of an expertly-constructed narrative such that user actions can be both meaningful and their consequences dramatically satisfying. But I think that for the foreseeable future, those wishing to square that circle are going to have to stick to drugs and dreams.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the games that can be best turned into movies will be those that are glorified comics with an interface bolted on. Yeah, you can turn that into a movie. But there's no reason to pretend that its status as a game had anything to do with it.</p>
<p><em>* District 9 started out as an adaptation of Halo, but when that project fell apart the director was given free reign to pursue a smaller-budget adventure.&nbsp; What he came up with has a production design that is recognizably descended from the Halo universe, but which shares none of its ponderous, godawful backstory.&nbsp; Fanboys' refusal to acknowledge the incredibly-derivative-yet-also-really-stupid-and-boring nature of the Halo games' setting and story is a persistent source of irritation for me.</em></p>

Well, okay, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ryanavent.com/blog/?p=2201">Ryan doesn't think so</a>.&nbsp; You should go read that post and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/08/07/AR2009080702043.html?hpid=opinionsbox1">the Greg Clark column</a> that prompted this discussion, although I have a feeling I'm about to quote a lot of Ryan's entry:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="docutils container">
Machine and robotic resources aren’t free; they’re resource constrained just like everything else is resource constrained. We have the tecnological know-how to replace millions of human workers with machines <em>right now</em>, but we don’t because the expense of building, programming, operating, and maintaining the machines is too great. It’s not worth it. As demand for human labour falls, the price of human labour will also fall making the hiring of humans more attractive. Meanwhile, as demand for robot labour increases, the price of robot labour will also increase (since the stuff robots are made of is scarce), making the use of a robot for any given task less attractive. There will then be some market equilibrium which will, in all likelihood, involve plenty of employment for low skilled workers.</div>
</blockquote>
<p>This all seems generally correct, but only very generally.&nbsp; It strikes me that the same argument could have been made about the job security of horses at the dawn of the age of the automobile.&nbsp; And sure, there are still plenty of horses around, but I think you'd have to attribute that to a pretty generous horse-subsidization scheme.</p>
<p>Ryan lists a couple of constraints on mechanization:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="docutils container">
One is the analytical constraint — there are some human cognitive and physical processes that we haven’t yet learned to emulated in machines. This will continue to be less binding over time, enabling workers to potentially compete with humans in a steadily broader range of fields.</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Certainly some subset of tasks currently performed by humans will be difficult to automate for a long time yet.&nbsp; But not only will technology improve, as Ryan acknowledges, but we can simply eliminate many tasks that are resistant to automation.&nbsp; A computer can't have a conversation with a person the way that a customer service representative can.&nbsp; But instead of resigning themselves to this fact, businesses have simply moved to eliminate this class of commercial interaction, substituting for it with websites, IVR systems and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.comcast.net">brutal indifference</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="docutils container">
Then there is the energy constraint. Machines require power to operate, and the more machines we build, the more power they’ll need. This constraint might eventually be overcome, but until then energy costs will rise with the machine share of the labour force, helping to keep humans at work.</div>
</blockquote>
<p>I think this is overstated.&nbsp; It's a real issue, sure, but it takes energy to run a clerk, too -- it's just that it has to be slowly collected from the sun over a period of months, then the resulting chemical artifact collected, processed, shipped, stocked, sold and prepared.&nbsp; That cost is going to have to be covered by the clerk's salary, and on a per work-unit basis it's going to be a lot higher than burning coal somewhere and shoving the electrons into a high-tension wire.&nbsp; And this doesn't even account for the fact that our outrageous social norms demand that the business owner pay to power the clerk even when he's not making the firm any money.</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="docutils container">
And then there is the materials constraint. So long as it costs money to build things out of other things, it will be difficult and costly to scale up the machine share of the labour force.</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Raw materials seem to be holding pretty steady -- in the last few years we've seen a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.mongabay.com/images/commodities/charts/chart-index_metals.html">noticeable blip</a> in prices of copper and a few other things, and I admit I don't feel qualified to assess the scare stories about peak chromium/lithium/whatever that arise from time to time. But in general I don't think there's much indication that supplies of automation-enabling materials will limit further mechanization.&nbsp; The raw inputs -- metal, motors, plastics, microchips -- are already produced at enormous scale for many other sectors.&nbsp; If demand for automation products spikes, those resources can probably be reallocated without any enormous price shocks.</p>
<p>Besides, raw materials just don't make up that much of the price tag for this stuff.&nbsp; A large chunk of the cost is the engineering effort that goes into it, which is a knowledge product and therefore not something we can think of as subject to quite the same constraints as physical materials.&nbsp; As patents expire and as modularity and abstraction spread, I think the absolute price of automation technology is likely to continue to drop.&nbsp; You only have to look at the rise of Roomba to see that robots have been getting dramatically cheaper at a rapid clip.&nbsp; Certainly the burden of proof should rest with those who contend otherwise.</p>
<p>The crucial thing to realize about all this is that the less-than-fully-automated status quo is not proof that we've reached an equilibrium.&nbsp; There are cultural hurdles to overcome, for one thing.&nbsp; These days if I order a sandwich at Wawa, I do so through a computerized interface.&nbsp; Could this have been done fifteen years ago? Sure, probably -- maybe not with a fancy touchscreen, but pictographic buttons would've gotten the job done.&nbsp; I don't think that my grandparents' generation would've liked that, though, and I doubt that Wawa wanted to be the first chain to bet on such an approach.</p>
<p>Perhaps more importantly, it's also the case that the size of the total, cross-societal capital investment that we're talking about is pretty large.&nbsp; It seems reasonable to me to expect that it may take businesses decades to finance the purchase of as many robots as they should optimally have.&nbsp; It's a complicated undertaking for a business, and in many cases the specific, non-technological design of the systems is still being worked out.&nbsp; Consider automated parking garages: the necessary technologies -- magstripe cards, vending machines, robotic gates -- have existed for a long time, but the pay-near-the-exit kiosk setup seems to only have emerged in the last decade or two as the best way to organize it all.&nbsp; Or look at McDonald's: they've been experimenting with automation technology for at least a decade, slowly rolling out fry-loading machines and the like.&nbsp; Does anyone doubt that the basic technologies for robotic burger assembly already exist?&nbsp; But the firm's got a profitable business to run, and franchisees are no doubt slow to finance these upgrades; there's no hurry.&nbsp; It took decades to complete the electrification of the country, and its robotification -- which promises gradual economic benefits rather than immediate quality of life improvements -- may take even longer.</p>
<p>Broadly, I'm sure that Ryan's right: there'll be an equilibrium reached at some point.&nbsp; But I don't see much indication that we're there yet, and it seems conceivable that wages for unskilled human labor at that equilibrium point will be below the threshold that's necessary for funding a minimally-acceptable existence (some would argue that this is already the case).&nbsp; I'm no economist, but it seems like weird things are likely to occur as labor costs are converted to capital costs, and an unavoidable shift toward a vast welfare state seems like a totally plausible possibility to me.</p>
<p>The good news is that this can be inferred to be more or less what happened in the world of Star Trek*, and that seems to have worked out okay.</p>
<p>* Though of course our perspective on the matter is distorted by the focus on Starfleet</p>
<p><strong>YOU SAY ARTISTS, I SAY STARFLEET:</strong> Ezra <a class="reference external" href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/ezra-klein/2009/08/dystopia_in_the_outlook_sectio.html">weighs in</a>.&nbsp; Also check the unhyperlinkable comment by &quot;thedavidmo&quot; about how standards of living will be higher in our robot-filled future.&nbsp; Yes!&nbsp; And that's not even counting the benefits to be had by reducing the per capita level of <em>toil</em>.&nbsp; Not that I'll be alive for a revolutionary reduction in necessary work, mind you, but I think there's a decent chance of seeing many businesses move to a 4-day work week, which will leave the total number of hours worked mathematically pristine, but which in practice will mean a whole lot less time spent on (or thinking about) the job.</p>

Yes, this is self-evidently dumb. But I thought I had prepared myself. I'm no card counter, but I had logged a decent number of hours practicing on my phone, learning the charts while trying to absorb the statistical futility of the undertaking. I was still a little fuzzy at the edges -- what to do with a 12, how many fractions of a percentage point favored the house -- but these were marginal bits of knowledge. I was confident that I was ready for the tables.</p>
<p>But wow! My last encounter with a blackjack dealer had stunned me with its speed; I was sure that the same thing couldn't happen again, at least not with the same viciousness. But it did! Three more times! The algorithm I'd enjoyed mastering suddenly seemed dully mechanical, and I started glowering around the room for the waitress who was supposed to be bringing my drink -- that consolation having more to do with it being free than the alcohol it contained. I was never up, and barely paused on my way down.</p>
<p>This is all hopelessly naive of me, I know. I'd fooled myself into thinking that a flipped coin ought to produce even results over, if not a sample of 2, then at least a period smaller than my bankroll divided by the minimum bet at the table. I am assured by statisticians, some of whom I am dating, that this is not actually the case.</p>
<p>On Saturday afternoon, in a wild-west-themed casino, I put an exasperated final $80 down on a table manned by an older Asian man who would sing out &quot;Yoo hoo!&quot; every time someone drew 21. In this supportive atmosphere I managed to win back enough money to upgrade my net position from &quot;horrifying&quot; to merely &quot;worst-case&quot; -- just enough to redeem my faith in gambling, of course. But it was not a profitable weekend.</p>
<p>It was still a good weekend, though. Not for the food and wine part of the ludicrous food and wine junket, mind you -- you'll hear nary an unkind word from my bought-and-paid-for ass over at <a class="reference external" href="http://internetfoodassociation.com/">the nominal excuse for this trip</a>, but suffice it to say that I would not recommend the festival to a friend, unless for some reason that friend had expressed an interest in paying $30 to stand in line.</p>
<p>It was fun to see some food celebrities, though (I was *this close* to Emeril! I couldn't see him, but the aroma of sweated-out cajun spices was unmistakable). And Atlantic City seems more plausibly non-seedy every time I go. Nothing changes between visits, mind you, but the elderly slot jockeys recede further from my mental foreground, making the whole thing merely tasteless rather than crushingly depressing.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, the most fun part of the weekend had nothing to do with losing hundreds of dollars. On Saturday Emily and I met up with our friends Tara and John Carlos, who were in town for Tara's sister's big family birthday blowout. They'd rented an Indian-themed room inside the blues-themed concert venue in the New Orleans-themed casino, which was both cooler and more aesthetically cohesive than you might expect.</p>
<p>The party was a bit weird. Tara is not really comfortable in her family's scene, which I can understand but which is too bad because the scene is kind of awesome. It's admittedly a little strange to see a guy who could easily -- easily! -- pass as a wiseguy extra on the Sopranos chatting with his daughter's overtanned and impossibly-provocatively-dressed friends. But it's all in good fun, and seemingly not an inappropriate amount of fun, except maybe for the really drunk guy who'd apparently just had a stroke a couple of weeks before. It's Jersey high society, basically, and I say that without derision. Like Tara, I could never feel wholly comfortable in that social milieu, but it was sort of heartwarming to observe it and see how happy its participants seemed to be.</p>
<p>Still, we decided we weren't on board for the &quot;c'mooon, you gotta daaaaance&quot; part of the evening, though, and decamped to the first non-casino destination of the weekend. We'd spent some time googling for &quot;real atlantic city&quot;, &quot;locals bar atlantic city&quot; and the like, and had come up with three candidates. I can't recall the name of the first one, but its nickname was &quot;the Blood Pit&quot; and it seemed to no longer exist. The second was the Pic-a-lilli Pub, about which Time Out New York <a class="reference external" href="http://newyork.timeout.com/articles/travel/1856/atlantic-city-nj-grindhouse-edition">gushed</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
Affectionately referred to as “the Pick” by its mirthless denizens, this bar has the feel of an Otto Dix painting. The drinks are cheap ($2.50 bottles), the patrons are local, and the chances are fair to middling that you will hear an ’80s rock pastiche from the jukebox at some point during the evening.</blockquote>
<p>This sounded promising, but we were a little hungry and so instead headed to Tony's Baltimore Grill, a pizza joint with a 24-hour bar in the front. It was a great decision.</p>
<p>It was a little off-putting to come through the doors, because the whole bar turned to briefly regard us. I hurried to a booth, trying to keep a low profile, but we soon realized this wasn't really a problem: it's just that nearly every person to enter the bar was met with cheering and applause in the sort of way that I used to assume only happened in bars filmed before a live studio audience.</p>
<p>The bar turned out to be filled with raucous twenty- and thirty-somethings, only a few of whom seemed to be off duty from the casinos. There was lots of yelling; sometimes exclamations spread through the bar just for the sheer hell of it. Dudes would get into almost-fights, but all it took was a few moments of separation by a grizzled bartender to remind them that actually they loved each other, man. The bar staff started throwing coasters, and then some other people started throwing coasters, and the perfect, perfect, perfect one pictured above hit me in the face. The thrower was mortified -- I said &quot;really that's alright&quot; but he insisted I pound my beer so that he could buy me another one, and who was I to defy local custom? The matronly waitresses looked on from their perch at the register, wary but content that things were going more or less according to plan.</p>
<p>Lager was $2.50 a pint, the pizza wasn't great but had its cheese broiled to crisp brown deliciousness, and everything was just right. Well, alright, the jukebox could use some work. But really, next time you're in Atlantic City you should consider losing a ton of money and then buying yourself some very cheap beer. Tony's Baltimore Grill. Don't tell them I sent you.</p>

<p>Most of the accounts of paper mail's decline explain it by pointing to the advantages of electronic communication.&nbsp; And it's true: email and the phone have the edge in terms of both speed and cost.&nbsp; But most commentators ignore one of their biggest advantages, which is that modern communication mediums outperform the mail by <em>not being terrible and useless.</em></p>
<p>It is, I admit, sometimes pleasant to find an envelope whose little tear-off sides hint that a check is waiting.&nbsp; But ignoring that specific case for a moment: what does mail do for me?&nbsp; For the most part, it's nothing more than a string of obligations -- and worse, ones that are hidden within a stream of cynical and dishonest commercial appeals, many of them specifically designed to trick me both by their packaging and their contents (credit monitoring sounds great! and look, the credit card company is sending me checks to use!).</p>
<p>Yet mail can't be ignored, because it's the de facto -- and often de jure -- system for notifying individuals of events that may ultimately have serious legal or financial consequences.&nbsp; If I've been sending an electronic bill payment to the wrong address, or am supposed to report for jury duty, or forgot to sign my tax return, the mail is the only place that I'll hear about it before the cable stops working or a deputy shows up.</p>
<p>But use of the mail for this vital function has been made more difficult at a steady clip as solicitations have become a bigger and bigger portion of each user's daily haul.&nbsp; It's gotten to the point where I almost never receive a replacement credit card the first time it's sent to me.&nbsp; The envelopes that carry such cards are, for obvious reasons, not clearly labeled, and so they wind up torn in half and in the trash.&nbsp; It isn't until I notice an expired card, call the company and make a mental note to start opening envelopes that the situation is resolved.</p>
<p>The reduction of home delivery to five days per week won't change this, of course, but if it represents a step toward the destruction of the mail as our society's official communication medium, I'm all for it.&nbsp; Messages about events that could impact my finances or freedom shouldn't be transmitted via a channel that's mostly filled with advertising.&nbsp; Instead we ought to be using a medium that's legally protected from commercial intrusion -- there are desperately few, but mobile phones come to mind, and cryptographically signed email could work.&nbsp; Really, almost anything would be better than burying important messages amidst advertisements designed to look like important messages.</p>

                    <p>Well, I don't know.&nbsp; Sommer wrote a <a class="reference external" href="http://dcist.com/2009/08/testing_the_new_nextbus_iphone_app.php">great review of the newly-released Nextbus iPhone app</a>.&nbsp; I went ahead and bought it, and you know what?&nbsp; It's worth three bucks.&nbsp; I'm not sure I can or should undercut the effort. Besides, one of their developers showed up in comments and stated that they're willing to work with developers via their (not publicly disclosed) API.&nbsp; I've been emailing back and forth with him, and it's clear that they're willing to let people use their data if they enter into royalty agreements.</p>
<p>So I can either duplicate functionality (but try to do things slightly better -- unlikely, given my lack of iPhone development experience) or I could try to anonymously release a free, quick-hit application that undercuts Nextbus's slightly dodgy inclination to charge Metro, then turn around and charge the people who fund Metro.&nbsp; But doing that would certainly violate the license surrounding their data, and they'd get the app pulled and/or break whatever interface I cook up.</p>
<p>At the moment I'm leaning toward collecting data over a set period of time, then analyzing how badly Metro does at arriving at each stop on time.&nbsp; But doing that would require matching GTFS stops to Nextbus stops, which <a class="reference external" href="/2009/07/02/some-nextbus-stats/">isn't easy</a>.</p>
<p>So tell me, Nextbus-iPhone-app-users: is there anything you wish the app did that it doesn't?&nbsp; Or should I content myself with the above-proposed navel-gazing?</p>

                    <p>This <a class="reference external" href="http://haystacknetwork.com/">Iran proxy network thingy</a> seems deeply suspicious to me. A tech journalist friend seems to think it's legit, and I suppose I'll admit that it's too early to say. But I have a lot of questions:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Why, when demand for your service will vary with global political events, would you <a class="reference external" href="http://blog.austinheap.com/haystack-gets-a-dell-dude/">buy servers</a> instead of leasing them or using a scalable VPS setup?</li>
<li>How is having a monolithic server installation in a datacenter consistent with avoiding ISP-level blocking by the government? How can this project succeed if the government just decides to block all encrypted traffic?</li>
<li>Why is there no discussion on the <a class="reference external" href="http://haystacknetwork.com/">project website</a> of the technical approach being used? Are the developers familiar with the architecture and history of the <a class="reference external" href="http://freenetproject.org/">Freenet</a> project, or <a class="reference external" href="http://tor.eff.org">Tor</a>? What are their technical credentials, anyway, other than having read the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/">Squid docs</a>?</li>
<li>Why isn't the app open source, or even just released? If the answer is &quot;security through obscurity&quot;, how long do the developers expect that tactic to work?</li>
<li>Why have the organizers been hitting people up for money ever since the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.prnine.com/releases-002834/iran/haystack-developers-announce-successful-test-plants-program-handful-iranians.html">first press release</a>?</li>
<li>And, most pressingly: what could possibly possess someone to unsarcastically describe himself by uttering the phrase, &quot;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.prnine.com/releases-002816/iran/haystack-program-providing-unfiltered-internet-access-iran-released.html">I have always been a man of principle</a>&quot;?</li>

                    <p>Although it is arguably as much a business innovation as a technological one, there's no doubt that the iPhone has radically altered the mobile device landscape, and, in the process, profoundly changed the way that Americans think about sitting on the toilet.</p>
<p>In fact, its uses extend beyond this crass but foremost example.&nbsp; You've also got your standing-in-line downtime, the crucial waiting-for-coffee-to-brew period, and of course miscellaneous hours spent idly fiddling while in meetings. If I'm not mistaken, the Bureau of Labor Statistics is on record as saying that high scores from Sudoku games played on mobile devices account for most of the productivity gains of the past decade.</p>
<p>Personally, I like to use the device to catch up on my online reading.&nbsp; But this crucial electronic-fucking-around is slowed by the need to enter URLs.&nbsp; If you're like me, typically you'll have some long-form article open in a neglected browser tab: say, 2000 words from Sasha Frere-Jones on why your implicit acceptance of the latest top 40 hit means you're more -- and less! -- racist than you thought.&nbsp; It's something I mean to read, but which the demands of the workday have made me put off.&nbsp; As I leave my desk to pursue less productive activities (food acquisition; interaction with humans), I frequently find myself wishing I had that article loaded on my handset.&nbsp; But the only way to move it there without tedious typing is to email myself the link, then check my email, then click on the link.&nbsp; If only there was an almost perfectly equivalent but slightly faster way!</p>
<p>Well, you're/I'm in luck!&nbsp; I twittered this ridiculous first-world complaint the other day, and &#64;tbridge and &#64;jroo helpfully pointed me toward <a class="reference external" href="http://prowl.weks.net/">Prowl</a>, a $2.99 iPhone app that takes the 3.0 firmware's push notification capabilities and wraps them in a simple API.</p>
<p>This opens the door to creating a bookmarklet that grabs your browser's current URL and pushes it to your phone.&nbsp; The phone will buzz, you'll click the &quot;view&quot; button, and you can then follow the link.&nbsp; Easy!&nbsp; Here's the bookmarklet.&nbsp; Just follow these steps (which, I should note, have only been tested in Firefox 3.5):</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Buy Prowl.&nbsp; Open it on your iPhone -- you'll need to register with its parent site and give the app permission to display notifications.</li>
<li>Using your newly-created credentials, log into the Prowl site. Go to the settings tab and create an API key by clicking the appropriate button.</li>
<li>Paste the API key into the form field below. Click the &quot;Create Bookmarklet&quot; button. NOTE: the customization of the bookmarklet is done in client-side Javascript, entirely within your browser -- don't worry, you won't be sending me your API key.</li>
<li>Drag the newly-created button into your browser's quicklaunch bar.</li>
</ol>
<p>Simple!&nbsp; Now when you click that bookmarklet a new window will be briefly opened.&nbsp; It'll submit a request to the Prowl site that contains the current URL that you're looking at.&nbsp; Shortly thereafter you should get a message on your phone with the link.</p>

                    <p>Via <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~tblee/">Tim</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/24/business/media/24content.html">here's the AP's new plan</a> for protecting its content from the depredations of those who would seek to promote it. Apparently they'll be adding a &quot;digital wrapper&quot; to each story, which will contain some sort of invisible watermark, or something, and will be able to communicate with the AP's servers in order to track unauthorized use -- including, astoundingly, use that is nothing more than a linked headline. A few points:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">This plan is technologically hopeless.&nbsp; It is essentially an effort to install DRM into plain text.&nbsp; That's impossible.&nbsp; DRM schemes fail even when added to executable, binary file formats that are read by systems under the control of the content publisher.&nbsp; Neither of those conditions apply here, nor will they, unless the AP attempts to eschew the web browser entirely.&nbsp; Presumably they're counting on some Javascript to phone home.&nbsp; That'll work fine for AP member sites, but it will not survive the copy-and-pasted trip into a HuffPo blockquote.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">This plan is dishonest.&nbsp; It's interesting that the AP thinks its headlines contain so much unique value that they deserve protection -- very interesting indeed, given that member organizations habitually rewrite those headlines (without penalty from the AP, of course).</p>
</li>
<li><div class="first line-block">
<div class="line">Even if the plan could work, it wouldn't work the way they seem to think.&nbsp; From the article:</div>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>“If someone can build multibillion-dollar businesses out of keywords, we can build multihundred-million businesses out of headlines, and we’re going to do that,” Mr. Curley said. The goal, he said, was not to have less use of the news articles, but to be paid for any use.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Similarly, if a lemonade stand starts charging $1000 per glass, their intent is probably not to reduce lemonade purchases. It's simply to create an industry-sustaining level of revenue. And who can argue with that?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It's really kind of astounding.&nbsp; I can't claim to know much about econ -- once I figured out that &quot;where the lines cross&quot; was the answer to every exam question in 101, I pretty much tuned out -- but the realities of the situation should be apparent to anyone who's thought about these questions for even a moment.</p>
<p><strong>CLARITY!:</strong> Also via Tim, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ap.org/media/images/APnewsregistry.jpg">a diagram of how the scheme will work</a>.&nbsp; I was wrong!&nbsp; All this talk about &quot;sending signals back&quot; pointed toward Javascript, but that &quot;hNews format&quot; label gives the game away: they're going to use <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microformat#Specific_microformats">microformats</a>.&nbsp; Microformats are a beautifully simple idea: adding meaningful data to HTML markup in the form of specific class tags. They were big with the semantic web crowd before they got confused and started spending all their time reinventing XML and relational database technology.</p>
<p>Microformats won't actively cause signals to be sent back, but the AP can run a spider to look for instances of them.&nbsp; And the information might survive a copy and paste! If the copier doesn't paste into Notepad in between! And they don't block the AP spider!</p>
<p>So yeah, it's still hopeless.&nbsp; These guys need to start lobbying for substantial expansions of copyright law -- that's the only way I can see this working.&nbsp; Or maybe they'll put clickwrap licenses around every AP news site that mandate preservation of the microformat data in all subsequent use.&nbsp; Either way it'd prompt a very interesting legal fight.</p>

                    <p><img alt="20090722_defjamvendetta" class="alignright size-full wp-image-830" src="/static/2009/07/20090722_defjamvendetta.jpg" style="width: 286px; height: 219px;" />The blogosphere, and now <a class="reference external" href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=106857447">NPR</a>, have been abuzz recently with analyses of the new beef between Jay-Z and The Game, as expressed in the language of international relations. This is all to the good — the more the blogosphere resembles drunken bullshitting, the happier I am. yet this approach carries problems. The quality and quantity of hip hop feuds is erratic; we can't count on them to provide a reliable source of rhetorical inspiration. Recognizing this problem, let me humbly suggest a stupider alternative.</p>
<p>You guys should start watching more professional wrestling. Hear me out.</p>
<p>At this point, hip hop beefs are clearly artifice — in fact it seems strange to recall that this wasn't always obvious. The transparent motivation for this feud, and most, is to increase the relevance of a lesser player like The Game. And this is for the best: like punk rock and heavy metal before it, hip hop seems to have realized that a musical genre can celebrate brutality or authenticity, but not both — not if it wants to be a successful enterprise rather than just self-annihilating performance art. Yet despite this unavoidable choice, the realities of the genre's history and the demands of its fanbase make a definitive choice between these alternatives impossible.</p>
<p>This merely-half-hearted embrace of fakery places limits on the flamboyance of any conflict. What's the root of this current beef? The Game insulting Jay-Z's wife? By any theatrical standard that's a pretty weak source of motivation. Yet because of the pretense that it was real, even this mild offense was considered by hip hop observers to be beyond the pale.</p>
<p>Professional wrestling does not submit to such arbitrary narrative restrictions. There, the feuds are rooted in more satisfyingly concrete disagreements. Like when Kurt Angle became upset because Stone Cold Steve Austin had sprayed him with a beer truck's high-pressure discharge hose. Or when the Big Bossman, for reasons known only to him, interrupted The Big Show's father's funeral by chaining the coffin to the back of his patrol car and driving haphazardly across the graveyard in which the funeral party had assembled. Or when Triple H drugged and kidnapped his boss's daughter in order to marry her against her will in Las Vegas (an admittedly troubling arrangement that, feminists will be glad to know, was ultimately vindicated when Stephanie McMahon renounced her ties to her father and asserted her retroactive consent).</p>
<p>I know what you're thinking: there is no parallel here. None of this has anything to do with feuding rappers. I appreciate that the shift in dramatic scale is somewhat jarring, but I think there are real parallels. In both industries, charisma and braggadocio provide a more compelling set of attributes that supplement a skill-set that is frequently only of nominal importance (wrestling ability; verbal skills). Conflicts are typically resolved through a strangely constrained vocabulary (wrestling moves; assertions about how much cocaine each speaker has sold). Departures from these vocabularies can prompt the audience to dismiss the formal relevance of the associated actions (belts do not change hands if you are only able to pin your opponent after hitting him with a sledge hammer; sales and critical acclaim are often dismissed with appeals to authenticity). Both mediums sustain their vitality through a sort of &quot;farm system&quot; that suffers from fewer commercial constraints (regional promotions; mix tapes). Supporting groups are formed around stars to promote new or marginal talent. The approbation of the fanbase is the ultimate source of political capital, although the development of strategic business relationships allows each industry's top players to semi-permanently cement their positions as kingmakers. Hell, both industries have even got a guy called <a class="reference external" href="http://www.hhhthegame.com/">The Game</a>.</p>
<p>So take some time. Consider my proposal. Read up on <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Def_jam_vendetta">Def Jam: Vendetta</a>, which is something like a Grand Unified Field Theory for the preceding post. And recognize that there's no reason to resist the narrative ridiculousness that you truly crave. You don't have to settle for half-assed efforts at thug life improv. Embrace the authentically inauthentic.</p>
