<li>It's interesting to watch how people are using the service, and to try to deduce the norms that will soon emerge arround it.&nbsp; I just de-linked my Flickr account because I realized I didn't mean to push a recently-uploaded photo on my followers.&nbsp; I still have Twitter linked to it -- though given the FB status/Twitter faux pas, I suspect I'll remove that connection soon, too.</li>
<li>The automatic importation of contacts strikes me as a big mistake.&nbsp; Not only because it's a privacy problem, but because it short-circuits <a class="reference external" href="/2009/07/02/after-twitter/">the normal lifecycle of social networks</a>. It's a profoundly elitist opinion, but I do think that it's important to have an initial phase during which early-adopting users fill a new service with high-value content -- amusing, uncensored, nonprofessional/noncommercial communication -- creating a attractive networking target for the rest of the population, which then filters in.Instead, Google has&nbsp; opted to drop its users into the midpoint of its new network's lifecycle.&nbsp; I'm not sure this is a bad idea, exactly -- I'd love to have a network with the immediacy of Twitter, but (slightly) looser space and media limitations (I'll be curious to see whether Google has built the infrastructure behind Buzz to make more Twitter-like use cases possible). In theory, Buzz can satisfy that desire: it's basically FriendFeed, but with a very high adoption rate among my contacts thanks to Google's marketing advantage.&nbsp; But because it skipped the (ahem) buzz-building phase, Buzz will never garner the excitement and accompanying celebrity and media evangelism that Twitter has.</li>
<li>Similarly, I doubt I'll adopt an evangelical stance toward the service among my peers -- I don't do that very often, don't have much of a talent for it, and don't want to spend personal capital pushing a new social network (which, these days, is always a low-percentage play).&nbsp; But I'll keep watching, and I'll keep using Buzz if other people do.</li>

<p>Sure, they say <a class="reference external" href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hB3QGFJ85G28otgVt58qar23428Q">crime is down</a>.

<p>I am going semi-crazy from spending so many consecutive days in the house, clinging to small totems of civilization (showering, tooth-brushing, occasional pajama rotation).&nbsp; But it has been a good opportunity to make progress on various web projects that have been on the back burner for a while -- a site for my mom, and another, stupider site that I hope to share with you before too long.</p>

                    <p>Snow is great! <a class="reference external" href="http://blogstretch.blogspot.com/2010/02/it-is-still-snowing.html">Amanda is crazy</a>! Working from home is nice! And yes, I'm kind of sick of reading, and okay, I ate sardine tacos for lunch, and no, I have no idea what I would do if my power went out (but it's okay because THAT WILL NEVER HAPPEN).</p>
<p>But I still love the snow.&nbsp; It reminds me of that one big storm during my childhood, when a layer of snow was packed down to icy horribleness, then another foot was deposited on top, then a eighth-inch crust of freezing crust topped things off.&nbsp; That certainly gave the plows problems -- I got the whole week off school.&nbsp; Almost as good, it was just strong enough to support my form, when that form was properly enveloped in a puffy coat and on its stomach and sliding down the sleepy-streets-turned-gentle-hills of the neighborhood between my house and my friend Rob's.&nbsp; If you timed it, this turned out to not be such an efficient means of locomotion.&nbsp; At the time, though, it was the fastest, most thrilling way I'd ever moved across that space.</p>
<p>This storm seems likely to involve a bit less ecstatic ad-hoc sledding and a bit more disgusting slush and missing Taylor sandwich ingredients.&nbsp; Childhood in the suburbs has a commanding lead over adulthood in the city when it comes to winter wonderment.&nbsp; But I'm still thrilled to see icicles on my neighbors' gutters, and drifts accumulating in the corners of the alley below. C'mon, guys: <em>snow day</em>. Those words are going to thrill me until the day I die.</p>

                    <p>Every DC Metro rider owes Michael Perkins a debt of gratitude. For a while now he's been not only <a class="reference external" href="http://greatergreaterwashington.org/author.cgi?username=michaelp">covering WMATA</a> <strong>[UPDATE: link fixed]</strong>, but jumping through the hoops necessary to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.scribd.com/perkinsms">uncover details of their contracts, budgets and other documents</a> (and working on tech projects besides!).</p>
<p>Over the weekend he published his latest acquisition: <a class="reference external" href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/26194581/Nextbus-Contract-Redacted">the WMATA/Nextbus contract</a>. As you might imagine, it takes the reader on a harrowing emotional rollercoaster. But before we get to that, let's build some dramatic tension.</p>
<p><strong>PREVIOUSLY, ON &quot;LICENSING QUESTIONS RELATED TO NEXTBUS DATA&quot;</strong></p>
<p>After pulling the service due to concerns about its reliability, WMATA finally redeployed Nextbus last year. This happened not too long after the release of WMATA's scheduling information in the open GTFS format -- combined, the two excited a lot of interest in transit-enthusiast developers like myself.</p>
<p>But under what circumstances could the Nextbus data be used? The answer was not at all clear. Fortunately, Nextbus representatives began to pop up in relevant comment threads. Unfortunately, it soon became clear that there are <em>two</em> companies called Nextbus -- one of them is &quot;Nextbus, Inc.&quot; (which I'll call Nextbus) and one is &quot;Nextbus Information Systems&quot; (which I'll call NIS). I emailed back and forth with representatives from both. First, my emails with Alex Orloff from NIS:</p>
<p>Me:</p>
<blockquote>
Alex, another question for you: there's a lot of online confusion surrounding the relationship between Nextbus, Inc. and Nextbus Information Systems. Can you clarify the relationship between the two? Do you both have contracts with WMATA? And am I right in thinking that you're the company responsible for the Washington, DC-centric Nextbus app in the iPhone store? I'm seeing folks show up in blog comment sections who claim to be affiliated with these two companies, and who are asserting contradictory things.</blockquote>
<p>Alex:</p>
<blockquote>
When the transaction that created NextBus Inc. as a wholly owned subsidiary of Grey Island Systems occurred, NextBus Information Systems kept what is called the &quot;distribution business&quot; piece of NextBus, which includes all the things you would associate with distribution of data - licensing to third parties, delivery to cell phones, etc. The NextBus DC app on the App Store is indeed ours. We understand that there is some confusion about the relationship and we have encouraged NextBus Inc. to put a web page on nextbus.com helping people to understand our role. We think that that would be the simplest way to clear up any confusion - don't you think ?</blockquote>
<p>Me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Much of the conversation is occurring at the Greater Greater Washington blog. And yes, I agree that it would be helpful if Nextbus clarified its relationship to your organization and the bounds of its arrangement with WMATA.</p>
<p>Am I right in thinking that Nextbus Information Systems has no formal arrangement with WMATA, but rather possesses the rights to license the distribution of some of the data emerging from the Nextbus/WMATA agreement?</p>
<p>Sorry if this is muddying the waters -- just trying to get to the bottom of where I and other DC-area devs stand.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Aha I see the discussion now, I had seen that post a few days ago but Mike Smith's comment was not up then. Did he send you any information directly ? I'm curious as to what he said if you have contacted him directly. We are definitely trying to get NextBus to be more open about our relationship with them and our rights. Many developers are asking the same questions, and like you, many are confused about what's what.</p>
<p>We do not have an agreement with WMATA directly, our rights come from the agreement that was part of the sale to Grey Island, which reserved exclusive rights to distribution of the predictions, in particular to cell phones but also advertising, licensing, etc. in the United States (and UK). So our agreement covers any transit agency that NextBus tracks here in the US.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Next, my correspondence with Mike Smith of Nextbus.</p>
<p>Me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thank you for contributing to the comment thread at Greater Greater Washington. I hope you won't mind clarifying the distinction between your organization and Nextbus Information Systems (NIS). I've been in touch with Alex Orloff of NIS, and from my discussions with him have developer the understanding that Nextbus Inc. is contracted with WMATA, but that Nextbus Information Systems -- a wholly distinct entity -- retains the rights to distribute the resulting data to mobile devices, via an API, and perhaps in other ways.</p>
<p>I and others in the DC developer/transit community find all this quite confusing. I have a number of questions that I hope you won't mind answering. I think they'll go a long way toward clarifying the situation:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Is the relationship between Nextbus Inc. and Nextbus Information Services that I have described correct?</li>
<li>If NIS has the right to distribute the data, am I correct in assuming they have access to your servers? Mr. Orloff indicated a desire to have Nextbus Inc. clarify the relationship between the two firms at nextbus.com, leading me to believe that you have control over the domain; but surely he has *some* access to your systems if he is able to offer an API view of the data, as he indicated.</li>
<li>If NIS owns the rights to distribute the data but does not control the servers, what steps is Nextbus Inc. obligated to take in order to restrict third parties' access to the publicly available data at e.g. wmata.nextbus.com?</li>
<li>Does Nextbus assert ownership over non-predictive data produced as part of its contract with WMATA (e.g. routeconfig files)? What is its position on noncommercial use of such data?</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks very much for your help in clarifying these issues.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mike:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It would be inappropriate for me to weigh in on what distribution rights that NextBus Information Systems (NBIS) does or does not have, since they are indeed a separate entity. But I can tell you that the transit agencies own the data and have legal control over it.</p>
<p>Sorry I cannot be of more help.</p>
<p>Mike</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wasn't able to get more out of either of them. So here's my understanding of the situation: at some point, Nextbus sold the main part of its business to Grey Island Systems. An independent portion remained, however, called Nextbus Information Systems, and it retained the rights to license prediction information generated by past -- and future! -- deals with the part now owned by Grey Island. The Grey Island/Nextbus folks say that the transit agencies they contract with own full rights to the data, same as NIS, but they're understandably hesitant to step on the NIS folks' toes (lest they get sued, presumably). Mr. Orloff was very helpful, but made it clear that I'd need to purchase a license before distributing any Nextbus-based application. Mr. Smith was also helpful, but not really empowered to speak about the licensing situation.</p>
<p><strong>WHICH BRINGS US TO THE CONTRACT</strong></p>
<p>First: Grey Island Systems is listed as the parent company of the Nextbus that did business with WMATA. So far so good. But then things take a discouraging turn:</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="/static/2010/02/nextbus11.png"><img alt="image1" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1232" src="/static/2010/02/nextbus11.png" style="width: 450px; height: 178px;" /></a></p>
<p>But wait! There's reason for hope: (WMATA is &quot;the Authority&quot; in this excerpt):</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="/static/2010/02/nextbus2.png"><img alt="image2" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1231" src="/static/2010/02/nextbus2.png" style="width: 500px; height: 714px;" /></a></p>
<p>And finally, vindication (CIS = Customer Information System, i.e. Nextbus):</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="/static/2010/02/nextbus3.png"><img alt="image3" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1233" src="/static/2010/02/nextbus3.png" style="width: 450px; height: 89px;" /></a></p>
<p>It's possible that I'm missing something, but at this point I think my pre-contract understanding has been validated: WMATA has full rights to the data, which means it can give the data away if it wants to. Now we just need WMATA to give the all-clear! We may also need them to mirror the data or otherwise ensure that Nextbus can't complain that we're unfairly hammering their servers. I've got some ideas about how to proceed, and I've got a serendipitous meeting happening in the next few days -- more soon, I hope!</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>A couple of weeks ago, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/?p=826">Bunnie Huang wrote this in response to a piece on NPR</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here’s [the part of the NPR story that] I found particularly poignant:</p>
<blockquote>
Two centuries ago, our forebears would have known the precise history and source of almost every one of the limited number of things they ate and owned. They would have been familiar with the pig, the carpenter, the weaver, the loom and the dairymaid. The range of items available for purchase may have grown exponentially since then, but our understanding of their genesis has grown ever more obscure. We are now as imaginatively disconnected from the production and distribution of our goods as we are practically in reach of them, a process of alienation which has stripped us of opportunities for wonder, gratitude and guilt.</blockquote>
<p>That last sentence, I think, resonates strongly with my personal motivation as a Maker. I dive deeply into the supply chain, learning the processes and understanding the people behind our Things, because it enables me to once again feel the wonder, gratitude, and guilt for the Things we otherwise take for granted. Wonder at the skill of craftsmen and the cleverness of designers; gratitude for the passion and hard work of my peers; and guilt for the sacrifice, waste, and unsustainable practices motivated by an obscure system of perverse economic incentives.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I was a kid, I fell in love with computers.&nbsp; The world was incomprehensibly vast and terrifying, but here was a sort of bounded system, created by and therefore obviously understandable by humans, yet still mysterious enough to fascinate.&nbsp; It was the closest thing to magic that I knew of that I also knew I could master.</p>
<p>So, without even realizing what I was doing, I started to try to learn about computers.&nbsp; I messed around with AppleSoft BASIC; I set up BBS software; I figured out how to get a dual-modem setup working for 3-person games of Doom; I snipped the keyboard lock wire on my parents' 386 so that they couldn't keep me off of the thing during summer break while they were away at work.</p>
<p>Along the way I began to understand bits and pieces of these systems.&nbsp; More importantly, I began to understand the larger aesthetic that unified them.&nbsp; It's a cliche that kids are better at technology than adults -- the joke's now about programming Tivo instead of programming the VCR, but it persists because it's true.&nbsp; I think that's mostly because kids come to new interfaces with fewer preconceptions about how they ought to work, and with more patience because their time is worth less (I've certainly found myself getting worse at learning new interfaces as I've gotten older and (even) less patient).</p>
<p>But I was <em>really</em> good with technology, not just kid-good, and I think it's because I had immersed myself in so much of it.&nbsp; The thing you have to understand about bad interface design is that it's not a product of stupidity: it's a product of engineering.&nbsp; There's a reason that your childhood TV's power button made a bigger click than its channel button did.&nbsp; There's a reason that the channel button only became a button after it was a dial!&nbsp; At that age, I couldn't explain those reasons.&nbsp; But I could sense their existence, and became able to make inferences based upon them.</p>
<p>This isn't a project that I've completed, and certainly not one that I've abandoned.&nbsp; People sometimes refer to &quot;stacks&quot; of technologies that work in complementary ways -- the PHP scripting language runs on the Apache webserver, which runs on a machine using the Linux operating system that also has a MySQL database installed, and together they form the so-called LAMP stack that serves a lot of the web's content.</p>
<p>What the above quote is talking about is what I think of as the stack: the system of abstractions and physical mechanisms that makes digital computing possible.&nbsp; There is <em>so much of it</em>.&nbsp; It's a good thing, too, because as you chase down an explanation for one mysterious part, the fascination associated with it recedes.&nbsp; There was a time when I didn't know how web pages worked, and was thrilled to learn HTML.&nbsp; Now, frankly, I don't give a shit.&nbsp; But I <em>am</em> interested in how HTML is interpreted by Mozilla's layout engine. And how operating systems work. And how those operating systems abstract away the varyingly serial and parallel nature of processors.&nbsp; And how silicon doping and photolithography produce those processors (and why ever-higher wavelengths frequencies of light are needed for that -- and what limits there are on this technique). Or how sound is stored on a hard drive. And what makes a keyboard's keys rebound, and how USB keyboards are different from PS/2 keyboards. And how copper is mined, and how we create a voltage across huge stretches of it.&nbsp; And what a voltage is! And why my LCD monitor needs to create such a large voltage to produce light, and how that light is encoded by my retina.&nbsp; And the way that an HTTP request becomes TCP packets which become ethernet frames, and then how that's all reversed on the other side.</p>
<p>I can give pretty good answers to a few of these questions, perform tolerable hand-waving for others, and am totally at sea for some.&nbsp; As you might've noticed from my list, I've become less and less interested in what's happening within software's incredibly vast tangle of abstractions as I've gotten older -- the abstraction itself eventually becomes a predictable pattern, and therefore a bit boring.&nbsp; These days it takes a relatively extreme case of novelty to get me excited about software (typically something that will be completely inscrutable to non-geeks who don't share my now-quite-perverse taste).</p>
<p>And of course there's always more. Really, the computer was a conceptual frame and gateway through which I could start considering every piece of technology, bit by bit.&nbsp; It's a little more than a hobby and considerably less than a religion, but pondering the stack is important to me.</p>
<p>It's not for everybody, though.&nbsp; <a class="reference external" href="http://www.rinich.com/post/358597818/i-love-walled-gardens">Here's an example</a>!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some of the biggest complaints [about the iPad] come from programmers that say the closed system means people won’t be able to satisfy their computer curiosities. To which I again say: Good! Then they’ll have to satisfy their curiosities about emotional maturity and social interaction and possibly even thinking about making the world a better place.</p>
<p>It is not productive to spend an hour learning how to change the font on your computer’s clock. Even if while you’re doing that you’re learning about how computers work, you’re wasting your time and getting somewhere trivial very slowly. It reminds me of those copies of Shakespeare schools give children with all the annotations defining words and metaphors and techniques, so that kids can appreciate Shakespeare. It doesn’t work. It just makes Shakespeare look like a cryptogram that you can’t read like you do a normal play. Opening up a system that wasn’t meant to be opened just makes little kids cry.</p>
<p>The standard response, when I sink so low as to let programmers communicate with me, is: “But Rory, programming is my passion. I was willing to spend that long learning how to code.” No, I think back at them — programmers are not given the satisfaction of hearing my voice. No, you were willing to spend that long because you had obsessive-compulsive problems mixed with an antisocial attitude.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>This system is closed! No tinkering! You can browse the Internet, or check your mail, or take notes, or listen to music, but when you’re out of little buttons to press then you’re out of things to do. Discover something else. You are not allowed to delve into the things that nobody ought to care about. You’re forced to get another button, or to put down your pad and make out with the other people wandering, dazed, unsure of what to do.</p>
<p>But however will children learn how to program? Simple: We will make them applications that teach them how to program. Every kid wants to make video games and Google, so it’s not like having a closed system will make them forget that such things are possible. When they go to learn, however, they will not learn by wasting their time doing things that will never make them happy in life. Instead, they will go to the carefully-screened App Store, and they will search for “How do I make video games”, and they will find a little button that teaches them and gives them a run-time environment in which to tinker. And because the iPad is so elegant and makes elegance so relatively easy, these apps will be elegant. We won’t get a row of advanced text editors too complex for people to understand. We will have a lot of simple, easy things that show us how joyful it is to tinker around, and that reveal their complexity and power as we learn enough to work at that level. I might even try my hand at something like that myself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is something to this!&nbsp; And yet, it's just <em>wrong</em> about how to teach programming.&nbsp; Programs that teach programming are stupid -- they're for tourists.&nbsp; The motivating impulse is noble, and I'd use one to give a class of students an idea of how computers work, but the talented engineers that emerge from that class will abandon such toys as soon as they can.</p>
<p>This is how people like <a class="reference external" href="http://al3x.net/2010/01/28/ipad.html">Alex</a> and myself learned to do the things we can do.&nbsp; Like anyone else, we like some things about ourselves, and we don't like things that we perceive as threats to the cultural dynamics that made us the way we are.</p>
<p>And I think this is why we don't like the idea of the iPad.&nbsp; More abstraction is good for users and bad for budding engineers.&nbsp; A kid today will learn much less about engineering from an HDTV's on screen menu than he would from my grandparents' chunky black &amp; white set.&nbsp; There's just more complexity to sort through, and replacing those raw objects d'engineering with stupid toys that represent what some engineer <em>thinks</em> is important about engineering -- well, I'm not sure there's a better alternative, but really it's just adding another layer of abstraction, one that will inevitably have to be peeled back.&nbsp; The entry point to the stack is getting <a class="reference external" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/matthewyglesias/~3/i0sJv8S8apQ/the-end-of-hierarchical-file-systems.php">further and further away from its bottom</a>; the task ahead of those kids is getting harder and harder.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we're not all going to be issued iPads.&nbsp; The personal computer will continue to exist.&nbsp; It's still quite modular, projects like Linux are still going strong, and the geeks of tomorrow will still be able to get a foothold as they begin to figure out how the world works.&nbsp; But hopefully this explains why things like the iPad are galling to people like me.&nbsp; My objections aren't really technical; they're cultural.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> <a class="reference external" href="http://timothyblee.com/?p=2191">Tim feels similarly</a>. Imagine that!</p>

                    <p>One thing you have to say for the iPad: it sits right in the middle of three classic consumer hardware debates: fat/thin client; walled garden/libre; and information appliance/general purpose device.&nbsp; I have no idea whether this position makes it a better device, but it sure does generate a lot of passionate (though fundamentally boring-and-cliched-as-hell) blog posts.</p>
<p>The libre/walled garden is the only one I find even remotely interesting, and that only because of the cultural considerations it embodies -- see <a class="reference external" href="http://al3x.net/2010/01/28/ipad.html">this post</a> from Alex Payne for more on that.&nbsp; <a class="reference external" href="http://io9.com/5458822/why-the-ipad-is-crap-futurism">Those making the assumption that the iPad represents some unitary future for computing</a>* are being quite silly, I think -- that's not going to happen.&nbsp; But it's worth reading Alex's post to understand <em>why</em> that admittedly-unlikely event would be <a class="reference external" href="http://mill-industries.com/post/341-breaking-curfew">a terrible thing for people like him and me</a>.</p>
<p>* Incidentally: any time you read something that approvingly quotes an expert whose listed credential is &quot;futurist&quot;, you should immediately dismiss it outright, and possibly also phone in a bomb threat to the publishing organization.&nbsp; Also: SixthSense is a neat tech demo, but assuming it works as well as the video is an astounding act of credulousness.&nbsp; Besides, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.google.com/search?q=snow%20crash%20gargoyle">no one wants to look that dumb in public</a>.</p>

                    <p>I didn't watch the iPad announcement. Having read <a class="reference external" href="http://createdigitalmusic.com/2010/01/27/how-a-great-product-can-be-bad-news-apple-ipad-and-the-closed-mac/">this</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://timothyblee.com/?p=2169">this</a> -- which I think you should read, too! -- it sounds like it was incredibly disappointing.&nbsp; Between my laptop, netbook and iPhone, the thing that I wish I could do but can't is read digital content while I'm sitting outside in the sun.&nbsp; To me the only thing that's interesting about this device is the <a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/choitotheworld/status/8288754455">psychotic</a> level of interest in its announcement that was on display, even by people from whom I wouldn't normally expect it.&nbsp; I'm increasingly convinced that the enthusiasms that make up geek culture (to the extent that such a thing exists) are part of a larger, communicable pathology that an ever-growing segment of the population is becoming susceptible to -- and not just because it's fashionable.</p>
<p>Anyway! Of today's tech news, I thought that the <a class="reference external" href="http://rdist.root.org/2010/01/27/how-the-ps3-hypervisor-was-hacked/">PS3's hypervisor getting cracked</a> was much more interesting than the iPad.&nbsp; Not really in an applied way -- you can already boot Linux on the thing (props to Sony for that), so you've gotta suspect that piracy is the primary aim of these efforts, which is a bit boring (especially since I don't plan to buy a PS3). But the technical details are just <em>neat</em>.&nbsp; The linked account gives a good rundown, but maybe I can explain <em>why</em> they're neat.</p>
<p>In the case of the PS1, Xbox and Xbox360, circumventi0n* techniques were clever but essentially reflective of failures of security design. By contrast, the engineering of the PS3's protection still looks logically bulletproof.&nbsp; The approach used by geohotz -- who also has done good work opening the iPhone, incidentally -- was to introduce a bunch of very tiny brown-outs into the system, screwing up the progress of the security-related things that it finds itself doing from time to time.&nbsp; There's more to it than that, of course: he needed to use what access to the system he <em>was</em> allowed to establish conditions such that when something went wrong, it was likely to go wrong in a way that was advantageous to him.&nbsp; As you might imagine, this is a considerably trickier thing than just pulling the plug until the power LED is half-faded (though using an FPGA sounds like overkill to me).</p>
<p>But still!&nbsp; More than the specific technical prowess involved, this speaks to the incredible difficulty of securing a system over which you can't assert physical control (especially if that system runs too hot to just encase its vulnerable parts in a blob of epoxy).&nbsp; In that respect it's kind of like <a class="reference external" href="http://freedom-to-tinker.com/blog/felten/new-research-result-cold-boot-attacks-disk-encryption">freezing RAM to make it preserve its contents long enough to extract them</a> (something done at the program <a class="reference external" href="http://www.timothyblee.com">Tim</a>'s attending, I should note).</p>
<p>* This is a completely providential typo. I have no idea how it happened, but I'm sure as hell not fixing it.</p>

                    <p>I asked this on Twitter last night, then quickly backed off, deferring to smarter friends to explain their outrage over the spending freeze that the President is proposing. I mean, in general I get it: we're liberals, we believe the government needs to expand in various ways, and we'd like to have some freedom to spend on our policy priorities while we're in power. It seems stupid for the president to tie his hands behind his back without even extracting concessions for doing so.</p>
<p>But then I think about the actual agenda: I'd put HCR, addressing climate change and dismantling the terrorball apparatus at the top of my list, as, I think, would most progressives. A spending freeze doesn't really preclude any of them*. In fact, all of them are potential deficit reducers!</p>
<p>Plus this, <a class="reference external" href="http://motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2010/01/little-night-music">via Kevin Drum</a>, just seems entirely wrong:</p>
<blockquote>
conservative Rich Lowry shows via Twitter that he understands why, even if the White House doesn't: &quot;spending freeze, no matter how notional, is a huge ceding of rhetorical grnd by WH. will give GOP more leverage in makng anti-hcr, stim case.&quot;</blockquote>
<p>You say &quot;ceding&quot;, I say &quot;co-opting&quot;. Reading <a class="reference external" href="http://washingtonindependent.com/74687/tea-partiers-and-freedomworks-craft-a-2010-agenda">Dave's piece from yesterday</a>, I was left with the impression that the alliance between establishment conservatives and the tea partiers -- the only actually vibrant part of the right at the moment -- is tenuous at best (&quot;...and starring Newt Gingrich as Ahmed Chalabi!&quot;). Maybe I'm being naive, but it seems to me like signaling a commitment to the teabaggers' (admittedly incoherent) concerns about fiscal responsibility could do a lot to confuse that burgeoning relationship. If it can be done without seriously endangering social welfare entitlements; without affecting the party's main policy initiatives; and hey, maybe even with it as cover for going after a few things like <a class="reference external" href="http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/archives/2010/01/obama-budget-to-call-for-freeze-in-non-security-discretionary-spending.php">farm subsidies</a>, then that all sounds okay to me.</p>
<p>Anyway, consider this <a class="reference external" href="/2010/01/12/in-which-my-ignorance-of-finance-is-revealed/">another plea</a> for explaining the obvious thing(s) I'm missing. At the moment I find myself convinced that this strategy <a class="reference external" href="http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/archives/2010/01/what-will-the-spending-freeze-amount-to.php">could blow up quite easily</a>. Certainly the last few weeks haven't instilled a ton of confidence in the Democrats' political skill. In fact, odds of this play working seem low!&nbsp; The idea that defusing this <em>one last minority critique</em> will yield dividends is a mistake that's been made many times in the past few months.&nbsp; Still, this specific proposal doesn't seem obviously crazy to me, or even that destructive.&nbsp; And though I'm in no position to say, it seems likely that <em>somebody</em> in the administration thinks it'll help in the fall.</p>
<p>* Obviously another stimulus becomes untenable under this proposal. Was that really all that likely, though?</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> <a class="reference external" href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/26/obama-liquidates-himself/">Yikes</a>. Okay.</p>
<p><strong>BUT ALSO:</strong> <a class="reference external" href="http://motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2010/01/spending-freeze-kabuki">This</a>. Which seems dumb, but okay.&nbsp; &quot;It's almost certain that Congress will pass, and the president will sign, a jobs bill&quot;, though? Well, okay, maybe!&nbsp; I don't know how to read all these sorts of tea leaves, and I'm not on any secret listservs or conference calls or anything like that. But it kind of seems to me like the Republicans have been complaining about ARRA's (alleged -- but absolute!) ineffectiveness for a while now, laying the groundwork for obstruction of any last-ditch effort to fix the economy before the election (which should be done! But c'mon, at this point it obviously won't save anybody.).&nbsp; I mean, yes, clearly everyone is about to start <em>talking</em> about jobs.&nbsp; I'm unclear on why folks think that'll turn into something, though.</p>

                    <p>It's official: the New York Times is erecting a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/21/business/media/21times.html">partial paywall</a>.</p>
<p>The first thing to say about this is that it's not going to work.&nbsp; Not in a technical sense. You can't give away your content for free some of the time, then stop -- not when the cost of reproducing that content is zero.&nbsp; It seems likely that users will be asked for an email address in order to use the site at all.&nbsp; But of course it would be easy to generate a ton of accounts and then build a firefox plugin to cycle between them (with some scripting, your monthly free-article-views can be multiplied by the number of captchas you're willing to fill out).&nbsp; Or&nbsp; you could create a site that caches NYT content, reducing the need for &quot;spending&quot; your free credits.&nbsp; Or you could make a browser plugin that uses P2P to serve viewed content to others who've asked for it after their credits are spent.</p>
<p>None of that's likely to be necessary, though -- the NYT has created <a class="reference external" href="http://nytimes.blogspace.com/genlink">loopholes</a> for bloggers and search engines before, and I imagine they'll do so again: it's just too tempting, and their future is too uncertain to close off any avenues of imagined salvation.&nbsp; But it will probably be fairly simple to take advantage of those loopholes for general reading.&nbsp; The web simply wasn't designed with the sorts of systems necessary to prevent that from happening.</p>
<p>Of course, even though the proposed scheme, like all other half-hearted (aka commercially viable) DRM systems, is technically hopeless, the system might work in a practical sense.&nbsp;&nbsp; Most people won't bother with the circumvention techniques that will emerge.&nbsp; People still make money selling DVDs even though CSS is cracked, for instance.&nbsp; But, as others have noted, the papers that have had the most success with paywalls are the ones that have asked readers to spend someone else's money on a subscription -- their employer's money, typically.&nbsp; I doubt the NYT can pull that trick off.</p>
<p>I don't have a solution, really.&nbsp; If I were in their shoes, would I try to put up a paywall? Maybe. If you're ever going to try, you should do so while your cultural import is at its height, which means as soon as possible -- the old media oligarchy is clearly set for steady decline.&nbsp; But if I were going to build a wall, I certainly wouldn't build cracks into it.&nbsp; A subscription-only model would radically diminish the paper's influence and consequently transform its components. But the choice may be between that and oblivion, and if it is, the time to choose is now.</p>
<p>They won't, though.</p>

                    <p><a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/sbma44/status/7712418746">I was wrong</a> about SMS donations to Haiti lining the pockets of mobile carriers: I'm told that the carriers are waiving their fees (which normally consume about half of the funds donated through SMS). I'm happy to be proven wrong! If you want to give to relief efforts by texting, you can do so without worrying that your money will be wasted. I still wish you wouldn't, though.</p>
<p>By waiving their fees the P-SMS vendors have escaped the following critique, but it still holds for the general case: premium SMS is an expensive way to donate. And it's going to remain so. Your mobile carrier has a monopoly on adding things to your phone bill. Like room service, buyers of P-SMS are part of a captive audience, and will always pay more than he or she would for the same good in more competitive arenas.</p>
<p>Just how bad is the carriers' cut?&nbsp; It's a little tough to say, though the most often-cited number is 50%.&nbsp; If you look at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.mgive.com/Pricing.aspx">this page</a>, from mGive, the prices actually look pretty good!&nbsp; They're competitive, at least, with what you might get charged by a bulk email vendor for handling your nonprofit's fundraising.&nbsp; But then you see something like <a class="reference external" href="http://www.txt4giving.com/price.html">this</a>, from a vendor in Europe -- a more developed P-SMS market -- and realize that mGive's slice of the pie doesn't include the fees charged by carriers, which dwarf the processor's cut.</p>
<p>I'm glad that the carriers aren't taking a percentage this time. But I suspect it's a relatively cynical -- and canny -- decision on their part. If you use P-SMS to provide aid to Haitians, you're helping to legitimize and standardize P-SMS. More organizations will consider adopting it -- will feel they <em>need</em> to adopt it -- and, to whatever extent it's used as a substitute for giving through mechanisms with lower costs, it will hurt the cause of charitable giving.</p>
<p>Perhaps the situation will eventually improve. Certainly the enormous cut that carriers routinely take is impossible to justify. But when you consider that the cost of normal SMS has been increasing as the service becomes more popular -- despite expanding network capacity and very low costs to carriers -- I think there's reason for pessimism (in terms of pure bandwidth, SMS is by far the most expensive type of data that is bought by normal consumers (by which I mean people who are not in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, nor on their way to the moon)).</p>
<p>I'm sorry to have provided incorrect information this morning about the specific case of using P-SMS to give to Haitian relief efforts, but I have no regrets at all about pushing people away from P-SMS giving in general. It's a bad deal, and I think it's likely to remain so. You shouldn't give it your business, and you shouldn't imply to others that doing so is a good idea.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Via comments, I see that the situation is yet <em>more</em> complicated.&nbsp; There's something called the <a class="reference external" href="http://mobilegiving.org/?page_id=51">Mobile Giving Foundation</a>, which seems to be a coalition of wireless operators who vet nonprofits and waive their normal predatory fees for those who qualify.&nbsp; I think that's how it works, anyway -- the site isn't very clear about it, and certainly makes no mention of what normal fees for P-SMS are.</p>
<p>It still appears to me to be an effort to promote P-SMS and deflect criticism, and I see no assurances that the fee waiver is a permanent policy.&nbsp; Judge for yourself, but I'm still pretty skeptical, and will not be donating via text message any time soon.</p>

                    <p>Not to me, anyway.&nbsp; But I think that perhaps I could just use some further explanation from people smarter than myself about how the financial system works.&nbsp; So consider this a plea for help -- one that I would've issued over Twitter, if Twitter's character limit was 2300% larger.</p>
<p>Anyway, the problem: <a class="reference external" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/11/AR2010011103892.html?hpid=topnews">this article</a> makes the case that the Federal Reserve has been having a very profitable year:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Fed will return about $45 billion to the U.S. Treasury for 2009, according to calculations by The Washington Post based on public documents. That reflects the highest earnings in the 96-year history of the central bank. The Fed, unlike most government agencies, funds itself from its own operations and returns its profits to the Treasury.</p>
<p>The numbers are good news for the federal budget and a sign that the Fed has been successful, at least so far, in protecting taxpayers as it intervenes in the economy -- though there remains a risk of significant losses in the future if the Fed sells some of its investments or loses money on its stakes in bailed-out firms.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>Much of the higher earnings came about because of the Fed's aggressive program of buying bonds, aiming to push interest rates down across the economy and thus stimulate growth. By the end of 2009, the Fed owned $1.8 trillion in U.S. government debt and mortgage-related securities, up from $497 billion a year earlier. The interest income on those investments was a major source of Fed profits -- though that income comes with risks, as the central bank could lose money if it later sells those securities to reduce the money supply.</p>
<p>The Fed also made money on its emergency loans to banks and other firms and on special programs to prop up lending, such as one that supports credit cards, auto loans, and other consumer and business lending. Those programs impose interest and fees on participants, with the aim of ensuring that the Fed does not lose money.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, okay, some of this makes sense: the emergency loan programs involve third parties and can, in fact, produce profit via interest on the loans.</p>
<p>But two questions.&nbsp; First: as the article states, these earnings will go back to the Treasury, which will be &quot;good news for the federal budget&quot; -- except that much of the earnings are attributed to gains from purchased federal debt -- bonds paid out by the Treasury.&nbsp; So, uh, how is this &quot;profit&quot; not completely circular?&nbsp; I suppose that perhaps it represents money that we thought we had spent but hadn't.&nbsp; Still, the Post's presentation of the issue seems very strange.</p>
<p>Second: what is the article talking about, anyway? Not to toot my own project's horn <em>too</em> much, but we've got <a class="reference external" href="http://www.subsidyscope.com/bailout/federal-reserve/">this nifty visualization of fed holdings</a> based on their weekly H.4.1 reports, and it's just not the case that the fed has increased the amount of Treasury securities it holds.&nbsp; There was a dip, but we're basically back at 2007 levels.&nbsp; The fed's portfolio has gotten much larger thanks to the bailout, but the real story looks to be its still-expanding investment in mortgage-backed securities.</p>
<p>I'm just the tech guy, so I hesitate to go much further out on this limb.&nbsp; But I think Neil Irwin could've done a lot more to distinguish between Treasuries and MBSes, and what they mean for the Fed's holdings.&nbsp; Help me Ryan Avent, you're my only hope!</p>
<p><strong>MORE:</strong> The <a class="reference external" href="http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2010/01/12/the-feds-earnings/#comments">first comment</a> on Felix Salmon's coverage of this article is helpful: basically, this is good news because it's not bad news.&nbsp; Perhaps it's a bit silly to think of profit from Treasury securities as a windfall for the government, but at least the Fed managed to keep prices from collapsing, which could've easily happened.&nbsp; I'm still confused by how the article presents its thesis, though.</p>

<p>I suspect there are a bunch of competent, harried young reporters hammering away at the substantive side of this operation.&nbsp; I might not like the audience they're courting or the way they're courting it, but I know people like them, I know that they're in a tough line of work, and I wish them well.&nbsp; But for their sake, here's hoping something gets done about that Superfund site of an opinion section.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Alright, this is true: last week, when DCist posted about the story, I came across <a class="reference external" href="http://jimtreacher.com/archives/002152.html">this post</a> ` &lt;<a class="reference external" href="http://dctrawler.dailycaller.com/2010/01/11/last-week-i-saw-a-police-sting-like-a-block-away-from-the-office/">http://dctrawler.dailycaller.com/2010/01/11/last-week-i-saw-a-police-sting-like-a-block-away-from-the-office/</a>&gt;`__ and briefly took it at face value.&nbsp; Then I read back in the archives a bit and became convinced that the site must be a parody blog set up by someone from TWI (the connection to the recovered-camera story is what fueled my suspicions).&nbsp; I concluded that if I knew who Jim Treacher was it'd probably be hilarious, but I don't, so I mostly just felt mildly irritated to have been taken in by that last entry.&nbsp; Earlier ones betrayed a less refined comic voice -- one that was a little too upfront with the &quot;diary of my class trip to DC&quot; tone that I took to be meant to belittle the real Treacher.</p>

<p>Admittedly, there are real concerns about giving Vince and the rest of the McMahons access to the levers of power -- Linda's tenure as WWE CEO showed many of her immediate family were all too willing to manipulate the matriarch's position for personal gain.&nbsp; And there are other potential problems: by this point in its long existence I think it's fair to characterize <em>D-generation X</em> as an insurgent paramilitary outfit; Stephanie McMahon's ties to the organization will surely become a campaign issue.</p>
<p>But this is all premature.&nbsp; The voters of Connecticut deserve to decide for themselves.&nbsp; If Linda does gain the nomination, she can count on my support, likely via the pay-per-view wing of her fundraising operation.</p>

<p>I won't deepen my d-baggery by pretending that I don't enjoy this sort of thing (MUST FEED RAVENOUS EGO) but I know I don't have a natural talent for being on camera, and it really does make my skin crawl to watch myself.&nbsp; On the plus side, the microsecond of Tom-provided content that they used contained one of my less-asinine pronouncements; I got them to avoid saying &quot;<strong>the</strong> DCist&quot;; and I pitched Mrs. Alnwick on doing a story about HacDC.&nbsp; I'm told there might be more on tonight's 10 pm newscast.</p>
<p>Anyway, just to be perfectly clear: yes, I am a complete fraud.</p>

                    <p>It's a little silly to be writing a third post about <em>Avatar</em>, particularly after seeing <em>Up in the Air</em> over the holiday and regaining some perspective on what movies can actually do.&nbsp; But this is about technology!</p>
<p>After <em>Avatar</em> we sat around Rocket Bar, snapping the 3D glasses in half and trying to recreate the day we spent screwing around with polarizing filters in middle school physics class (though more drunkenly this time). As with all 3D-via-2D-surface technology, different images need to be delivered to each eye, and since the glasses weren't the stupid red/blue combo from days of yore, we figured that they were doing so by delivering left-eye and right-eye frames in different polarities of light, with correspondingly different polarizing filters to keep the signals distinct.&nbsp; Combining the two filters ought to have let us filter out <em>all</em> light.&nbsp; Or so the classic experiment goes.</p>
<p>But it didn't work!&nbsp; Well, maybe it did, a little.&nbsp; When you put the lenses in front of each other and rotated one 90 degrees, there was a noticeable dimming, but not the total blackout that I expected.</p>
<p>Today a gentleman named Daniel posted some information to the HacDC list explaining what's going on: the light isn't linearly polarized, it's <em>circularly</em> polarized.&nbsp; I can't claim to really understand this, but the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_polarization">relevant wikipedia page</a> contains a diagram that almost fools me into thinking I do.&nbsp; More from Daniel:</p>
<blockquote>
... circular polarization is a lot like linear polarization and unless you're viewing circularly polarized light it IS a linear polarizing filter. However if you're viewing circularly polarized light then the benefit over linear-only is that you can turn your head from side to side without losing the effect (not real clear on how this works). RealD's breakthrough was in coming up with a cheap way to combine the linear filter with a quarter wave plate in one package without costly lamination, so they've brought the more advanced circular technology into the mainstream by making it affordable. However, there is additional cost in that the screen has to be coated in aluminum paint or something that will reflect the light while maintaining polarization.</blockquote>
<p>Interesting!&nbsp; The <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RealD_Cinema">RealD wikipedia page</a> fills in some more blanks.&nbsp; There are really only four parts to the system: a high-end digital projector that can manage crazily high frame rates and which your theater has hopefully already bought; the aforementioned polarity-preserving coating on the screen;&nbsp; a polarizing filter that sits in front of the projector, rapidly flipping between directions of circular polarization as right eye/left eye frames pop out of the projector; and the glasses, which are just specially-treated plastic.&nbsp; So there you have it.</p>
<p>What may be even more interesting than RealD's tech is how this will all play out in the home theater space.&nbsp; Matt told me that he'd spoken with his dad, who's a screenwriter (among other things), and that the industry is extremely excited about the prospects of <em>Avatar</em> because people can only get the 3D experience in the theater -- and anything that can prop up the perpetually-ailing (but completely essential-to-the-industry! for reasons of&nbsp; history, vanity and stupidity) theater business will be very welcome indeed.&nbsp; So it'll be nice to have that precious 3D magic bottled up in the theaters, ensuring a steady stream of fat-walleted rubes.</p>
<p>Except, of course, that <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Cameron%27s_Avatar:_The_Game">the Avatar videogame, which you will play at home, is going to be 3D</a>.&nbsp; Actually, this is technology that's been out for a while.&nbsp; Rather than fancy alternating-frame polarization, which a normal TV can't manage, the viewer wears glasses with LCD shutters that snap on and off to control which frames each of her eyes sees.</p>
<p>This kind of setup <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/product_Geforce_3D_Vision_Glasses_us.html">doesn't appear to be particularly cheap at the moment</a> -- you need some wireless syncing stuff in there too, not just amped-up solar calculator technology -- but it's certainly not unattainably expensive, and you can bet that the price will drop tremendously when someone begins pushing this as an essential home theater amenity and not just a niche gamer accessory.&nbsp; For all I know the <em>Avatar</em> game will drop the price considerably -- I imagine it'll be shipping SKUs that include the glasses.</p>
<p>And at that point, it's hard to imagine that the industry won't shoot itself in the foot, reenabling piracy when it foolishly decides to buy whatever DRM snake oil it's being pushed by tech company salespeople to excuse the lucrative sale of Blu-Ray 3D discs.&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean, sure, in-theater cam work would be more difficult with a 3D film, but this stuff is getting distributed digitally anyway.&nbsp; I suspect we'll see 3D torrents within 8 months of the first home theater-compatible 3D movie release.&nbsp; Then we'll see some codec adjustments to make the formats more space-efficient, and then we'll be back at the status quo.&nbsp; And then, as the joke must inevitably go: on to Smell-O-Vision/the iTablet/whatever, the new savior of the film industry.&nbsp; I just hope this silly 3D cycle completes its run before I'm forced to buy any stupidly 3D-capable audiovisual equipment.</p>

                    <p>Well, the holiday break wasn't quite the triumphant return to blogging/exercise/filial-website-development that I'd hoped.&nbsp; It was plenty enjoyable, though, with an awfully nice stretch of time spent in Cazenovia and what has to be considered a successful New Year's -- certainly it was an improvement over last year's edition, if only because the bodily fluids spilled at this party were merely couch-threatening rather than life-threatening.&nbsp; Honestly, though, even the Mystery Puker acquitted himself well: that semi-comatose young man and his Brother With The Enigmatic Accent left sheepishly and cooperatively, but not before handing Charles $60 for &quot;cleaning costs&quot;/hungover New Year's Day dinner.&nbsp; Well done! If you asked Emily Post about the best way to go about regurgitating in a stranger's house, that is exactly what she'd tell you to do.</p>
<p>This year the special Party MVP award goes to Dave and the Governess, who were there at the front lines and quick to deal with all the unpleasantness.&nbsp; Someday, when life becomes more like the Lord of the Rings movies I watched over the weekend, there will be alabaster statues of you, next to the ones of Courtney, Radley, Becks, Ficke, and all the other New Year's Party heroes from the Fourth Age of Men.</p>
<p>As for the Christmas holiday -- well, I was hopelessly, embarrassingly spoiled.&nbsp; The two most egregious single pieces of loot: a new Weller soldering iron from my sister and her boyfriend and, from Emily, a Bosch jigsaw that I'm hesitant to look up on Amazon lest I find myself horrified at how much she spent.&nbsp; I'm pretty excited to start making (hopefully progressively-less-) ugly wooden boxes once the temperature in the garage becomes tolerable.&nbsp; In addition to those I also received really lovely, thoughtful gifts from Emily's mom and sister, my own mother, my dad, and really everyone who puts up with my nonsense.&nbsp; I am feeling quite grateful and more than a little sheepish about it all.</p>
