                    <p>My idiot hosting company seems to have made it impossible for PHP to write session files to /tmp, making some code that's been running nicely for years suddenly start to throw error messages wherever it dares to use session variables (not that I would! it's a third-party Flickr library). Nice job, guys. A pissy ticket has been filed with their help desk, some error-suppressing &#64;'s have been added to the code, and hopefully the issue will be resolved shortly.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>This morning I read Ezra and Tim Fernholz's 140-char-or-less (clever) discussion about Twitter in the front of the current issue of the Prospect (I don't think the exchange is online). Naturally, I agree with their basic conclusion that everything is terrible and getting worse. But they're primarily interested in the advent of Twitter within the media industry. I'm more concerned with how the media industry is transforming Twitter.</p>
<p>I've been moaning about the mainstream adoption of Twitter for a while now, and simultaneously feeling guilty — or at least hypocritical — for doing so. I really like Twitter! And, knowing one of the guys that works there at least a little, I want to see the company succeed. I really do think they created something cool, original and beautifully simple.</p>
<p>But it's been horrifying to watch Twitter evolve into a medium used for important (if not serious) communication. First and foremost, <a class="reference external" href="/2009/01/20/barack-obama-does-not-want-to-be-your-facebook-friend/">I am appalled</a> by our legislators' embrace of a time-suck communication medium that is necessarily superficial, and (more perniciously) one that is so convincingly fake-democratic while actually just facilitating communication with rich, Apple-computer-owning white people like myself.</p>
<p>Its adoption by the mainstream media has been similarly off-putting. As a cheap and fun SMS interface for media outlets I have no beef with it; as a means of personal marketing for journalists, the pretense and lack of honesty is dismaying (Ezra's diagnosis of their motivations as being grounded in a desire to avoid being left behind by the next blog-like internet trend is dead-on, I think — we should thank god we were spared from a hypothetical David Gregory Tumblr). I'd say the median journotweet is something like &quot;getting ready to sit down for an i/v w &#64;spalin. the lady is a tough cookie!&quot; when in fact it should be closer to &quot;complaining abt blogs in line to pick up kids &#64; sidwell frnds. no poor people around!&quot;</p>
<p>The medium's been a disaster for some of the better bloggers, too. There are a number of hilarious political writers who've tried to ply their wares in 140 characters or less and in the process ended up making their entire authorial voice sound like a cliche. This is not to say that tweets can't be <a class="reference external" href="http://www.idlewords.com/2009/01/my_year_in_twitter.htm">hilariously funny</a>. But if the medium that made your career is less restrictive, your Twittered communiques may just sound like hacky, &quot;gah!&quot;-filled Jon Stewart imitations. It is an almost unbelievably terrible medium for snark, but no one seems to have noticed.</p>
<p>Curmudgeonly enough for you? I'll happily admit that my bitching about the direction of the D.C. Twitter universe is selfish. It's a service that provided a form of communication I found charming and valuable: repartee with close friends and complete strangers. When the space between those groups began to fill in, things got weird. Tweeted conversations began to have personal — and, most horrifyingly, professional — implications. Soon it'll be time to retreat back to emails and texts among friends until the next early-adopter fad reaches that critical point where it's usefully populated but not yet filled with relatives and people you met at conferences.</p>
<p>But that doesn't mean that the professional-networking and personal-marketing uses of Twitter are invalid. It's just that they're just not what charmed me into using the service, so it makes me sad to see them disappear. This happened to blogs, too, of course, and then Facebook (though I sat that chapter out). At least this time I'm confident that the coming online-fun fallow period won't last forever.</p>

There's some pretty cool stuff! I haven't made it all the way through the 40-some submissions — and frankly, I'm just trying to orient myself, not delve into the apps with attention to make solid judgments about which ones are worthwhile (this is where you notice that the views expressed here have no bearing on the contest or its judging, are not representative of my eployer, are completely misinformed, etc.). But I feel like pointing out two entries in particular.</p>
<p>First, <a class="reference external" href="http://geekybuddha.org/buddy/">Buddy</a>, partly because I have a soft spot for chatbots but mostly because I find the robotic logo both adorable and terrifying.</p>
<p>And second, there's <a class="reference external" href="http://filibusted.us/">Filibusted</a>, which my filibuster-hating friends may find interesting, or at least encouraging.</p>
<p>But do check out <a class="reference external" href="http://sunlightlabs.com/appsforamerica/apps/">the rest of the entries</a> — there's some really good stuff in there. Although I should probably warn my fellow D.C. residents that repeatedly stopping yourself from entering your own zip code when searching for information about congressional representation is kind of depressing.</p>

<p>Gag me with a spoon from some little hole in the wall after-hours place in the LES that was supposed to just serve falafel but actually it started to have these awful high school bands sometimes and if you knew the guy he'd sell you big paper cups of Turkish beer and when I tell people this story now I usually say it turned into a Hot Topic because that's funnier but actually I just started hating how young everyone there seemed to be.</p>

                    <p>As long as I'm going on about music, I may as well recommend the new Harlem Shakes record. I agree with everyone about the new Yeah Yeah Yeahs, and <em>Bromst</em> will certainly be one of the records I remember from 2009, but right now <em>Technicolor Health</em> is dominating my playlist.</p>
<p>I'll refrain from trying to review the damn thing myself and instead point you toward <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cokemachineglow.com/record_review/4389/harlemshakes-technicolorhealth-2009">this writeup</a>, several paragraphs of which I heartily endorse despite its basically missing the point:</p>
<blockquote>
Technicolor Health is some sick candy: itâ€™s what our indie pop should sound like in 2009. It imagines a world where The OC still matters, where goddamned Kanye West is agreeably employed, and where your little brother doesnâ€™t think itâ€™s just ok to listen to Neutral Milk Hotel that many times/isnâ€™t aware of more than half of the bands the Shakes are copping freely when theyâ€™re not just writing sad songs about girls, which is a lot. This is indie pop. This is your lousy local band carried forward starship-like into a fizzing pop nebula and left to spin so fast and so ably that you ultimately forget the baggage and any corny adage; because Technicolor Health fundamentally sounds good and because its songs are well-crafted enough to make a lot of the African drumming and horns sound less like garnish and more like some well-earned reward for writing songs strong enough to make that shit sound sort of necessary. Technicolor Health is self-sufficient. It isnâ€™t community, it eats itself. It is every good-to-great pre-Wincing the Night Away (2007) indie pop record brought forth and actualised as the definitive good-to-great (but mostly great) indie pop record you should be hearing as spring turns into summer, 2009. The Harlem Shakes wear everybodyâ€™s clothes really well.</blockquote>
<p>The writer seems perturbed, but I don't know why. This is what's great about pop music — about really good pop music — <em>it will fool you every time</em>. Don't be upset or confused; this is its gift, and it would be boorish to question it. If they're doing it right, that fresh-faced young band will always sound new, they will always make your foot tap, they will always make you feel like you're soaring. Leave genealogy to the Mormons. You're wired for this shit. It doesn't have to be new, it just has to be great.</p>

                    <p>Man! There are few things I like more than getting back from a good show at the Black Cat. Chris suggested we go see his buddy's CD release party, and it was unexpectedly great. With the exception of the City Veins' horn-heavy, guest-star-laden offering, it was probably the best local CD release observation I've attended.</p>
<p>A big part of that was Olivia Mancini, whose opener status continues to perplex me. She's got stage presence, she's got pipes, she can play and, most importantly, she's got the songs to make all of the aforementioned matter. All I can hope is that she's on deck for the next doo-woppy pop/rock slot — between the Pipettes and the Ting Tings it seems like the market can bear one such act every year or two. Olivia certainly deserves that level of... well, if not stardom, then whatever replaced it in the current music industry landscape.</p>

<p>Next up: <a class="reference external" href="http://dcist.com/2005/11/08/three_stars_the.php">The Caribbean</a>. I spent a large part of their set retrieving beer, so I'm probably not in a good position to judge them. What I heard I mostly liked, but I think it's safe to say that they're not really my thing.</p>
<p>Finally there was Impossible Hair. And while they were oversold — if pressed, I would rate their haircuts as merely unlikely — they proved to be an excellent rock band. It was a tight performance filled with really, really good songs. Recommended! Would buy a t-shirt from again. Go see 'em if you have a chance — <a class="reference external" href="http://www.impossiblehair.com/MPSBL/TOUR.html">looks like</a> your next opportunity closer than Baltimore will be May 13 at Velvet. Unless you're planning a trip to Europe, that is.</p>

                    <p>Last night I finally found a moment to begin playing around with the WMATA GTFS data. Well, that's not quite right: I tried to use the Django ORM to load the dataset when it was first released, but a memory leak killed the process when I left it to run overnight — something that doesn't bode particularly well for our use of the ORM <a class="reference external" href="http://www.subsidyscope.com">at work</a>.</p>
<p>Last night I shoved the data it into a barebones MySQL database and added a few convenience columns to make it easier to work with the embedded time and date information. The scripts I used to do this take a little while to run (a few hours, perhaps, on the index-creation step — this could doubtless be sped up by moving the math into the SQL itself). And my use of MySQL is somewhat dumb, as the GIS capabilities of Postgres make it a more obvious choice. But if you're just looking to get started with this stuff, this will at least save you from having to write the CREATE TABLE statements yourself. It's all up on GitHub — <a class="reference external" href="http://github.com/sbma44/py-gtfs-mysql/tree/master">have at it</a>.</p>
<p>The next step for me is to generate a second-by-second snapshot of where every bus in the city is throughout the day, then feed that into <a class="reference external" href="http://processing.org">Processing</a> to make a movie like <a class="reference external" href="/2008/05/22/i-made-a-movie/">this one</a>. Maybe I'll even add a soundtrack this time — anybody feel like doing some field recordings of Metrobuses?</p>

                    <p>A while ago I pestered the author of the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.uhlenbrock.us/woxy/">WOXY playlist widget</a> to add Growl support — I like to be able to learn what I'm listening to without opening my web browser — and he was nice enough to do so. That worked okay for a while, but I think the widget's no longer being maintained; at the very least my copy now seems to be broken.</p>
<p>But two things have changed, making the kludginess of a widget unnecessary. First, a few months ago <a class="reference external" href="http://woxy.com/stream/mpg128.pls">WOXY began offering a 128kbps MP3 stream</a>, providing listenable sound quality without the use of their iTunes-unfriendly AACPlus stream. Second, it appears that last month <a class="reference external" href="http://www.dolejsky.com/2009/02/19/growltunes-patch/">some nice fellow on the internet</a> patched the GrowlTunes helper app so that it actually shows notifications properly when there's a track change in a radio stream being played by iTunes. Thanks, stranger!</p>

Now the rest of the album has made its way onto the internet, and after spending some time with it... I donno, guys. I won't claim to be the world's greatest Thermalsologist, but I really liked the last album. Unfortunately, it turns out that if you remove the anger and urgency from their music, you're left with plodding melodies and lyrics that are occasionally pretty lame (the first verse on the album certainly doesn't get things off to a very good start).</p>
<p>But I'm still looking forward to their May show at the Black Cat. Here's hoping they decide to play all their new stuff twice as fast as they recorded it — that could go a long way toward improving things.</p>

                    <p>Hey! <a class="reference external" href="http://www.wmata.com/rider_tools/developer_resources.cfm">WMATA has finally released it schedule data in a usable format</a>! Except also, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/3378830315/">it hasn't</a>.</p>
<p>I'm sure the 404 will be cleared up soon, but it's secured by a captcha, which makes me a little worried. Throughout this process WMATA was insistent that its schedule data was so vast, complex and ever-changing that it needed to be updated on a daily basis (if not faster!), and that those low-tech hillbillies at Google didn't seem to be up to the task. As you might imagine, I have my doubts about that. But if it's true, they need to provide an interface for downloading the data that can be used without daily human intervention. They may have, in the form of their RSS feed — it points to the same missing URL as the one behind the license agreement. If there's actually no security enforced by the captcha then this'll be fine, although idiotic. If there is, then RSS won't be sufficient. Which of these is the case won't be clear until the data's actually up.</p>
<p>On a personal note, I'm flattered by how many people have been looking in my direction for interesting uses of this new WMATA data. It's my own fault, of course — I've done a bunch of Metro-related projects, and although <a class="reference external" href="http://greatergreaterwashington.org/">GreaterGreaterWashington</a> deserves all the credit for this data release, I did have at least a <a class="reference external" href="/2008/12/16/metro-and-google/">peripheral role</a> in pestering WMATA for GTFS data.</p>
<p>But I should probably start managing expectations now: the most obvious use of the data — a mobile/iPhone app — requires a skillset I haven't got. Not that that'll stop me from trying, but it's likely that someone else will beat me to market and do a better (if not cheaper) job, particularly since this window between the 2.0 and 3.0 iPhone software is a weird time to begin looking at developing map-based applications. On the web side, Google Transit itself will presumably provide a comprehensive solution.</p>
<p>With all that said, I certainly intend to have a look at the data and see if I can do anything neat with it. Either way, the important thing is that regardless of who manages to do it first, riding the bus in DC is about to get a lot easier.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>My former coworker <a class="reference external" href="http://benbuckman.net/">Ben</a> wrote to me earlier today asking whether I had any particular recommendations for books about electronics and Arduino. I was in a voluble/caffeinated mood, and ended up producing enough text that I figured I might as well throw it on the ol' blog:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">I'd suggest the book <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Practical-Electronics-Inventors-Paul-Scherz/dp/0070580782">Practical Electronics for Inventors</a>. I've heard others speak highly of it, too. When I first read it (and I didn't read all of it) it didn't make a ton of sense. This was slightly disappointing, and all the more so given that others attest to it being one of the most approachable introductions available. But it's proven to be a useful (if at times slightly outdated) reference. And the scene-setting it provides is invaluable. I don't think I've ever actually built a voltage-dividing circuit (though it's a pretty basic thing), and to be honest I don't even find myself using Ohm's Law all that much — shameful, but relatively easy to avoid thanks to the Arduino's robustness and the various online calculators that are available — but these are good things to know. Understanding passive components in terms of hydraulic analogies is extremely helpful, too, at least for me.</div>
<div class="line">On to Arduino. I don't have any books about it, which probably says it all. The online docs are totally sufficient, and it's a much simpler topic in general than electronics. Still, it may be worth picking something up, particularly since Arduino resources are often geared toward programmers learning electronics (many microcontroller resources are set up exactly the other way, which can make them too elementary and too advanced at the same time). There's <a class="reference external" href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596155513/">this introductory book</a>, which I've heard HacDC's Serge Wroclawski describe as an okay Arduino/electronics combo primer for the total novice.</div>
<div class="line">But he also said that it's not advanced enough to really satisfy. For a more sophisticated alternative, I'll note that I've heard good nothing but good things about <a class="reference external" href="http://www.makingthingstalk.com/">Making Things Talk</a>.</div>
<div class="line">I'd also suggest looking at people's projects online. Frequently they're much simpler than you'd expect, because people like myself have muddled through and done things slightly incorrectly, but in ways that fall within the tolerances of the components. This is a good way to start — I built things that were pointless and expensive (transformers w/ bridge rectifiers? what was I thinking?) when I should've just done something simpler, and would have if I knew more about how others had solved the problems I was facing. Sometimes these projects cross into the realm of the dangerously stupid — see <a class="reference external" href="http://cryptonoid.blogspot.com/2007/08/fics-fonera-internet-controlled-switch.html">here</a> — but as long as you stay away from the sorts of voltages coming out of your wall, you should be fine.</div>
<div class="line">Above all, talk to folks who know what they're doing. I'm happy to fill that role to the extent that I can, but I'm almost entirely a fraud. I imagine there's probably a hacker space in your town — that'd be a great place to start. If you have any EE friends, pestering them over beers is a good idea, too. Generally you can find the information you need online, but knowing what terms or topics to search for can be tough. For instance, when I first started thinking about how to sense if a door was closed I only thought of mechanical solutions, not magnetic ones, because I simply hadn't heard of the existence of reed switches and Hall Effect sensors. Or you might want to measure how much a knob is turned and try to do something funky with a potentiometer to do it, instead of searching for details on rotary encoders. Simply having someone mention these to you can be all you need to figure them out for yourself.</div>

This was at least half of a good idea: Ryan always has interesting things to say about the business of running cities. And for my part, I imagine Kriston was counting on me to bring my own trademark brand of techno-philistinism (&quot;Why preserve buildings when we can just make models of them in Second Life?&quot;).</p>
<p>The joke's on him, though. The past couple of years' worth of Ryan's writing have been so convincing that whatever opinions I may have originally had on these matters have been almost entirely replaced with his — this happens an embarrassing amount when you have smart friends who write a lot. I'm afraid that the essay I produced is consequently just a half-baked version of the one that Ryan wrote. On the upside, I was glad to see Ryan take the potshot at the FBI building that I'd barely restrained myself from making (it's <em>so awful</em>).

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>Hello! I didn't spend last night in a hotel. This has become a sufficiently unusual occurrence that I thought I should mention it.</p>
<p>Not that I'm trying to present myself as a cosmopolitan traveler, mind you. My destinations have included Houston and Indianapolis, and next weekend I'll be in Atlanta. These are places which don't qualify as America's armpits, exactly — what are we, Goro? — but they could fairly be called the sweaty small of our great nation's back.</p>
<p>There's something to recommend each of them, though, and there was a lot to recommend Houston in particular. First, my sister lives there, and she's very charming. Beth works for the nonprofit that manages <a class="reference external" href="http://www.orangeshow.org/orange.html">The Orange Show</a> and the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.beercanhouse.org/">Beer Can House</a> (both of which are very cool), and her boyfriend Jeremy is in the business of making <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethylene_oxide">deadly, spider-attracting chemicals</a>. <a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ethorson/3349729432/">The two of them</a> have an extremely pleasant house in the part of Houston near the highway, which is to say I have no idea where they live. It's right by a taco truck called Elena's II, though, which is across the street from a taco truck called Elena's III. I can vouch for Elena's II — that was some of the best food I've had in recent memory. Elena's III could be a crapshoot for all I know.</p>
<p>That was the first thing that Emily and I realized about Houston: the food's great. We ate Mexican food at every possible opportunity and I don't think we were ever disappointed. Real barbacoa was a revelation.</p>
<p>The drinking was good, too. Bought from the supermarket, Shiner and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ethorson/3349729488/">Lone Star</a> are unremarkable beers. But placed into their proper context — say, an ice house yard filled with Sunday sun, kids shooting basketball, dogs stealing food and friendly gentlemen who genially critique visiting Yankees' horseshoe skills while not-very-discreetly smoking joints at the corner picnic table — they become the best beers you're ever going to taste.</p>
<p>Oh! We also went to the rodeo. The attached fair and livestock show are pretty much what you'd expect, except with more places selling multi-foot sausages (available with stick or without!). The actual rodeo, though, was unexpectedly great. Perhaps on repeat visits the novelty would wear off — I can imagine that the casual sexism with which the announcers discussed each barrel-riding cowgirl's beauty might start to rankle — but the actual events were thrilling and proceeded in quick succession. There's a lot to be said for watching a grown man leap from a horse onto a steer and wrestle it to the ground, and even more to be said for watching it twelve times in a row. Since then I have been surprised to find myself watching professional bullriding on television, and reading with credulous interest accounts of how the sport isn't actually cruel at all. That's how quickly this sport (see? I'm calling it a sport) can get its hooks into you.</p>
<p>But none of the proper rodeo events could compete with the Calf Scramble. For the uninitiated, this is an event in which our human society pits its children against those of the cows. Dozens of fresh-faced Future Farmers of America race toward a smaller crowd of confused, slightly bored calves and attempt to cajole them into submission. If you manage to subdue one of the calves you'll be presented with a certificate good for the future purchase of such an animal, which you'll then presumably raise. Who knows? With hard work and a little luck, in a few years you might be one of the cowboys over at the Ag Expo applying can after can of hairspray to a bull.</p>
<p>The charming part of the scramble is how simultaneously overmatched and excited the kids are. Emily and I watched a post-game interview with an ecstatic and disheveled young woman who had just won a calf, and no sir, she didn't mind at all that it had stepped on her head, in fact she didn't even remember that part!</p>
<p>Here's some video of the 2005 Houston Rodeo calf scramble. Unfortunately the professional rodeo videographers who shot it seem to have been intent on playing up the desperate athletic conflict of the thing. And who can blame them? They spend most of their time filming flinty cowboys as they casually, mercilessly assert their dominance over the bovine world. But most of the calf scramble is much more hapless than that, and considerably more endearing. If you had to pick a single representative image of the proceedings it would be of a girl holding on to a calf's tail in the corner of the arena, both of them confused about what should happen next.</p>
<p>From Houston we went to Galveston, then to Austin via Lockhart. We had some <a class="reference external" href="http://www.gaidosofgalveston.com/restaraunts.html">great seafood</a> in Galveston and stayed in a fancy hotel — it was nice! — but the town's clearly still getting itself together from the hurricane's aftermath. Austin was Austin — you know it's great. Suspiciously great, in fact, like all college towns. Oh, and everything <a class="reference external" href="http://grammarpolice.net">Kriston</a> has said about barbecue in Lockhart is correct, and perhaps even understated. <a class="reference external" href="http://www.kreuzmarket.com/index.shtml">Kreuz Market</a> is a monastery, and imposes vows of abstinence from sauce and forks upon visitors as soon as they walk through the door. When your server turns and reaches into the fire-flecked pit behind him to retrieve some brisket, it's easy to imagine that he's actually reaching into the underworld — and is that really beef? It seems too tender. What sort of barbecue sect is this, anyway? It's all too delicious to fight, though. Accept your damnation, and be sure to try the sauerkraut.</p>
<p>And that was about it for Texas. I spent the past few days in Indianapolis at the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ire.org/training/conference/indy09/">Computer Assisted Reporting Conference</a>. The conference was good: it was fun to be told embarrassing stories about my new coworkers, and to observe the extent to which journalists everywhere seem to share the same talents and affectations — many of the same ones that I suffer from and/or aspire to. These were good people, and I felt right at home.</p>
<p>Indianapolis, though... well, I don't know. They've got some creepy, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ire.org/training/conference/indy09/">Masonic-looking monuments</a>, which makes me think there may be some pretty good secret conspiracies going on. But the downtown is incredibly free of personality; the closest thing I observed to local color was an installation of the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.360indianapolis.com/Restaurants/WeberGrillRestaurant.html">Weber Grill chain restaurant</a>. On the plus side, the tapwater seemed to be extremely soft, so any travelers who are more worried about limestone scale or excessive shampooing times than about access to culinary and cultural options would do well to give Indianapolis a look.</p>
<p>In five days: Atlanta. I've been before and it was okay, although it was hard to shake the feeling that Ted Turner was singlehandedly responsible for about 90% of the city. Maybe this time will be different; I'll report back.</p>

It did leave me wondering about another point, though: whether the availability of this sort of back channel is one of the factors that's led to the blogosphere's diminished vibrancy.</p>
<p>There's an obvious advantage to moving the social and argument-refining functions of online conversation to a venue where participants aren't exposed to the risks of misinterpretation, prudishness or unreasonably high expectations. Opting for a listserv post instead of a trackback means no public castigation for stupid mistakes and no worrying about an occasional thoughtless (or just really funny) remark getting you in trouble with your employer. And, as Ezra points out, it's better to have wary experts offer their wisdom in private than not at all. Besides, it's not like participants are giving up much by foregoing the contributions of the slack-jawed commentariat during this process (aside: I remain baffled by well-meaning web triumphalists' calls for the use of technology to enable more direct participation in the policy process — have they spent <em>any</em> time in blog comment sections?).</p>
<p>It's hard to begrudge anyone this sort of professional conservatism, particularly when their industry is in turmoil. I certainly engage in similar behaviors when I find them advantageous. But it does seem likely to me that there's a homogenizing effect that comes from blog-labor-saving devices like mailing lists and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.memeorandum.com/">memeorandum</a>. As a fan of these writers I'm glad for anything that makes their work easier, but as a member of the reading public I have to admit: it's kind of a drag to know that the blogosphere's efforts to improve itself have led to its audience being protected from so much interesting content.</p>

                    <p>I haven't seen <em>Watchmen</em> yet — Emily and I were traveling last night, bound for a quick vacation in Texas. Just about the time everyone else was suffering through &quot;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJRthpxDM10">Citizen Solder</a>&quot; I was tucking into an enormous plate of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.chuys.com/location.html">delicious blue corn tortillas</a>. So I say this based on the comic, not the film.</p>
<p>But of course <a class="reference external" href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/tapped_archive?month=03&amp;year=2009&amp;base_name=in_defense_of_the_penis">Phoebe's right</a> that there's a double standard when it comes to female and male nudity in films, and our discomfort at either is a bit silly. <em>Watchmen</em> seems like an odd time to make that case, though, because here the nudity is used precisely <strong>because</strong> we're uncomfortable with it. Dr. Manhattan wanders around naked, and that seems odd to us. But it doesn't seem odd to him because he's a superbeing that's almost completely alienated from humanity. To him a body is a construct, and it's impossible to understand the social conventions surrounding it or anything else. If the audience was similarly blasé about Dr. M striding about in his deathday suit there wouldn't be any point to showing him doing so.</p>

His perspective also happens to be cheerier than my own — I remain somewhat pessimistic about the ultimate economic consequences of these changes, even as I find myself looking forward to their effect on our society.</p>
<p>The good news, though, is that I don't actually know anything about economics, so for now let's all just assume that everything will be fine.</p>

This is understandable, but we shouldn't let cultural traditions that are relevant for only a small subset of the population hold the rest of us back from scientific progression in the field of sandwiches.</p>
</p><p>(It's true, of course, that you can find non-kosher reubens, but I still feel that the historical burden of religion has prevented the quest for a superior reuben condiment from receiving the attention it deserves.)</p>
