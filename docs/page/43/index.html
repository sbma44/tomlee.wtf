                    <p>Apologies for the terrible video quality, but I can't help posting a pet peeve of mine: the lack of standards for walk/don't walk signs at intersections. The countdown timers are great, but it's impossible to know at which point during the countdown the light will change to yellow.</p>
<p>This video is from the south edge of Logan Circle — an intersection I bike through every day. You can see that in one direction the light turns yellow when the countdown is at zero; in the other, the light turns yellow around &quot;5&quot; and is red at zero. This inconsistency seems dangerous.</p>

</center></p><p>Let's face it: if you're on a bike or in a car you'll occasionally find yourself trying to make a light. We can pretend that the stoplight should be the sole direction for vehicle operators, but that's a bit silly: the countdown timers are clearly an irresistible source of information that can be used to determine whether it's possible to get through an intersection safely. When they occasionally behave in unexpected ways, it's a genuine hazard.</p>
<p>I'm speaking from experience. Back in high school I was hit by a car while on my bike thanks to a combination of my own stupidity and a non-standard &quot;don't walk&quot; indicator. The overall dumbness of my teenage boy self was admittedly the driving factor. But that's hard to correct — it would've been a lot easier to properly program the signal so that the solid-red-hand had corresponded with the usual pause-at-yellow instead of green-means-go.</p>

                    <p>It's only Wednesday, but it's already been kind of an intense week. You may have noticed me failing to respond quickly by email, help you migrate your hotmail contacts, or join you in watching movies in which David Bowie magically inconveniences teens. I apologize. There's a deadline looming, and consequently I'm wasting a lot less time on the internet and elsewhere than I'd like. But I can still dimly recall a time when my life wasn't solely devoted to building doomed UGC also-rans.</p>
<p>And part of that time was spent at Six Flags, as <a class="reference external" href="http://www.movering.com/node/407">Emily</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://silbatron.com/?p=210">Michael</a> already recounted. I really had no idea that a bona-fide amusement park was accessible by DC public transportation. The last time I went to the park it was still called &quot;Wild World&quot; and didn't have much in it except a single wooden coaster and a lot of bored birthday party attendees.</p>
<p>Things have improved since then. If the rollercoaster and hour-long medical drama industries are any indication, humans really enjoy the sensation of finding out that they're not going to die after all. In fact, the only sensation they seem to enjoy more is learning that somebody else <em>is</em>, or at least is about to have a very bad time (this is why there are more crime procedurals than hospital dramas). Under Dan Snyder's thoughtful/big-spending leadership, the park has recognized this first important truth and blossomed into a wonderland of not-quite-deadly steel contraptions.</p>
<p><em>Superman: Ride of Steel</em> was probably the best coaster we went on, although the still-unridden Batman attraction seemed to break down with enough frequency that I think it must be particularly fun. The <em>Tower of Doom</em> was also pretty great: it just picks you up and drops you, cutting out the artifice and leaving riders strangely silent as they shuffle toward the exit.</p>
<p>The service left a little to be desired. It seemed like every employee had reported for orientation that morning — the atmosphere of the place can be summed up by the phrase, &quot;Oh, <em>that's</em> what that button does!&quot; This was mostly fine, though, as it meant that the employees were less beaten down by their awful summer jobs than one might expect. Tempers briefly flaired when it became apparent that each $25 cheese pizza ordered at the Papa John's counter was going to be meticulously made to order. Otherwise, all was well.</p>
<p>So I've got to give Six Flags a thumbs up. The lines were short, the beer was merely ballpark-priced and the waterpark had relatively few free-floating bandaids. Oh, and hey! I took some pictures:</p>

                    <p>I gave Twitter a try back around SXSWi. I liked it, but it posed a couple of problems. First, I ended up getting so many SMSes that it made my phone significantly less useful. Second, the messages were typically from acquaintances on the west coast — nobody in DC used it.</p>
<p>But that's all changed. I finally installed <a class="reference external" href="http://growl.info/">Growl</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://iconfactory.com/software/twitterrific">Twitterific</a>, which allow me to see my friends' updates in tasteful, unobtrusive windows in the upper right of my screen. &quot;Ambient intimacy&quot; is the phrase the Twitter people use, and it's just about right — I really do like knowing that <a class="reference external" href="http://www.al3x.net">al3x</a> just had a sub-par bagel, or that <a class="reference external" href="http://www.strangebirdlabs.com/">Rich</a> found an awesome new software tool. And Yglesias and Ezra have started using it with gusto, providing content relevant to my life in DC and encouraging me to respond in kind.</p>
<p>So I'm a Twitter born-again, I suppose, and have even gone so far as to install a <a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/badges">badge</a> in the sidebar, which is the web services equivalent of going steady. If any of this sounds intriguing, maybe you should give it a shot, too. Which is my long-winded way of saying: come entertain me, dammit.</p>

                    <p>I really like reading <a class="reference external" href="http://www.techliberation.com">The Technology Liberation Front</a>, but they're in serious disarray over Google's bid to force the 700 MHz band open. The backstory, for those who haven't been following it: the FCC is about to auction off the last major block of radio frequencies that will become available for ten years or so. They're particularly delicious frequencies, too, able to penetrate buildings and carry lots of information. Google's been lobbying the FCC, hoping that the agency will require some or all of the winning licensees to keep their networks open: they'd have to let new services and devices connect instead of getting to pick who connects and what services they offer, the way today's cellphone companies do.</p>
<p>This has thrown TLF into a tizzy. They've responded by providing hefty helpings of hand-wringing, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.techliberation.com/archives/042604.php">ludicrous potshots</a>, and, yes, some <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cato.org/tech/tk/070730-tk.html">actually reasonable analyses</a> of the situation.</p>
<p>It's easy to see why they're going nuts over this: their no-regulation ethos naturally favors big companies throwing their weight around. It's the market working! But Google is <em>also</em> a big company. And it's <em>also</em> throwing its weight around. Except this time, the weight is being thrown in the direction favored by those of us who want more regulation — the net neutrality cranks, communists and starry-eyed idealists. It's a very confusing situation for market triumphalists, and it undercuts a whole class of &quot;let 'em play ball&quot; arguments.</p>
<p>Consequently we get posts like <a class="reference external" href="http://www.techliberation.com/archives/042602.php">this one</a>, which is wrong in a number of ways:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Closed networks, or rather networks that aren't wide-open, offer some significant advantages. Security, for one, is markedly enhanced by a closed or limit-access system. That's why our national security system, at least those outside the Pentagon's email servers, are often totally severed from the wide-open internet.</p>
<p>An open network, like the internet itself, is prone to all variety of attacks. By contrast, I've never gotten a cell phone virus, something I owe to my cell carrier's closed system. My phone also seldom crashes, unlike my PC. I owe much of my PC woes to the OS I'm sure, but the various apps I have running are likely not custom made for my particular machine, unlike the apps found on many cell phones.</p>
<p>Let's think different for a moment and consider Apple. Mac has always been a fairly limitedâ€”if not closedâ€”system, yet this walled-garden isn't seen as an evil. That's likely because Macs works so well, but its crucial to recognize that much of this is owed to Mac's closed architecture, something that eliminates many of the variables that plague PCs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's a little funny to see folks that are normally against government paternalism turning around and arguing that we need Verizon to save us from ourselves. But that's basically what Cord Blomquist is saying.</p>
<p>I think he's wrong in a number of ways: cell phones are already more susceptible to dangers Mr. Blomquist is worried about than he realizes. However, the danger is minimal, both for engineering and economic reasons, neither of which are likely to be significantly affected by open networks. And even if they were, the openness of the network would allow consumers to select technologies that avoid these problems, while retaining the windfall in innovation that even Mr. Blomquist acknowledges.</p>
<p>Not all cell phones are closed software platforms. Many cheap ones are, but that's certainly not true of the smart phones that are getting less expensive and more popular — yet you don't hear many complaints about malware from Treo and Windows Mobile users, despite their ability to install third party software without getting permission from their carriers. Nor are the entirely-closed platforms all that secure: there are tons of bluetooth-based attacks out there, and there are a number of exploits already available for the iPhone (most related to vulnerabilities in Safari).</p>
<p>But you don't really have to worry about people taking advantage of them, because while these exploits can be used to annoy a phone's owner, they aren't much good for making money. And it's the entrepreneurial hackers that are the ones you have to fear — folks who enrich themselves with distributed denial of service attacks that hold websites for ransom, or who enslave armies of infected zombie machines to send out untraceable Viagra-hawking spam.</p>
<p>Cell phones aren't a very good target for DDoSing or enlistment in zombie hoards. They're underpowered, connected to slow networks, turned off some of the time, have limited battery life, and are owned by people who will notice a sudden spike in network usage as soon as their monthly bill arrives. Nor are cellphones particularly easy to infect — there's no ActiveX Mobile Edition, they frequently use optimizing proxies, and phones don't have much need for leaving ports open. They've got fewer vectors for infection and fewer capabilities that are useful for evildoers. There's not much reason for a hacker to go after them when easier and more attractive prey is available elsewhere.</p>
<p>On the question of stability, Mr. Blomquist is right about Apple benefiting from a relatively closed system. This is also why game consoles can generally avoid crashing: it's a lot easier to create a stable operating system if you don't have to support every dodgy piece of third-party add-on hardware under the sun. But of course cell phones already do support a few kinds of peripherals — bluetooth headsets and GPS units come to mind. And they already do spread their software systems across diverse hardware platforms, as Palm, Symbian, Windows Mobile and the J2ME stack have to be implemented on varying handsets. And, contrary to Mr. Blomquist's assumption, software developed for phones by third parties is typically created for a generic platform, not a specific handset. Cell phones have competing platforms, processor families and operating systems — the environment surrounding these apps is more similar to the one facing computers than Mr. Blomquist thinks.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that mobiles already have to deal with some hardware and software diversity, but are unlikely to ever have to struggle with the level that's given Windows its awful reputation. And hey, if any device can attach to the network, consumers can just leave a flaky software implementation for a better one — no contract-breaking required! It's the market in action! Doesn't that sound great?</p>
<p>Besides, using the PC as an example of openness gone awry is an odd gambit. Despite what's generally considered to be obviously inferior technology — both in hardware and the software written for it — the openness of PCs translated into such huge advantages in cost and ability to innovate that the platform decimated the competition. Those savings and the computing ubiquity they afforded gave birth to the open source movement and the consumer internet revolution. I love what my Mac does for me, but I'm astounded by what the PC platform did for the world.</p>
<p>But the silliest part comes here:</p>
<blockquote>
While an open wireless network is intriguing and could create a platform for unique innovations, limited networks will still offer stability, compatibility, security, and privacy and should be allowed to compete.</blockquote>
<p>Well, okay, sure. But who's stopping closed networks from competing? They've got huge swaths of network already, and we have scores of mobile vendors; existing players can and will keep their closed systems. If the advantages they offer are as great as Mr. Blomquist maintains, I'm sure they'll be able to carve out a comfortable niche for themselves — perhaps in the same way Apple has.</p>
<p>Yes, I'm sure Google's fighting for open networks for its own selfish reasons. But at the moment Google's interests seem to line up with my own pretty well. So I say we give openness a try. I'm pretty confident that it'll be recognized as hugely advantageous to consumers. I imagine that many of the telcos' advocates think so, too — they wouldn't be complaining half so loudly if they didn't.</p>

Construction crews were tearing up the street, redoing the lousy, lumpy patch job left by the workers who'd replaced our lead water pipes weeks ago.

                    <p>Kriston and Kate dragged Emily and I, kicking and screaming, out to get some culture last night, having purchased tickets to <em>Too Much Light Makes The Baby Go Blind</em> on our behalf. &quot;It's okay,&quot; Emily assured me, &quot;We can always leave and go see <em>Die Hard</em> — it's only a couple of blocks away.&quot;</p>
<p>But the play was great; if there are any performances with unsold tickets left, you should go. I thought the entirely serious pieces didn't work all that well, partly because there were so few of them and partly because they were a bit banal (yes, the Iraq War is bad; yes, Jesus probably wouldn't persecute gay people). But the rest of the plays were consistently hilarious, and never even a little boring.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>Shortly after posting the <a class="reference external" href="/2007/07/12/unfoggedbot/">Unfoggedbot</a> I got this email from <a class="reference external" href="http://wryandstanley.blogspot.com/">Stanley</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
Is there anywhere that Joe Humanities Degree can go to to learn how to do this sort of thing?</blockquote>
<p>Needless to say, this sort of request warms the cockles of my heart (whatever those are). And today, in the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.unfogged.com/archives/week_2007_07_22.html#007222">aftermath</a> of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.unfogged.com/archives/week_2007_07_22.html#007220">various</a> recent <a class="reference external" href="http://www.unfogged.com/archives/week_2007_07_22.html#007219">demonstrations</a> of scripting languages' utility, it might be a good time for me to press my case.</p>
<p>So: yes! Yes, a thousand times yes. You can learn a scripting language, which is the easy way to put together an IM answerbot, or a ballot-stuffing bot, or whatever else. In fact, you not only can but probably should. Scripting languages are a powerful way to control computerized systems. The computerization of the world is obviously nowhere near complete, but it's getting there quickly — and that means that the relevance and power of scripting languages are only going to increase. You can already control various pieces of the physical world with this technology, like lights and thermostats. And if you use Excel or perform repetitive tasks on a computer in your daily life, you can likely save yourself some drudgery with a well-written script. Soon enough your toaster, garage door and television will be accessible through these languages, too.</p>
<p>There will be other ways to control the electronic world, it's true. People will continue to invent visual metaphors like <a class="reference external" href="http://pipes.yahoo.com">Yahoo! Pipes</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://mindstorms.lego.com/eng/default.aspx">Lego Mindstorms</a> that expose some of the capabilities of programming in an accessible way. But we're a long way from the day when these GUIs confer the same power that knowledge of a scripting language affords. Besides, they tend to rely on metaphors that are more easily learned through a text-based programming language.</p>
<p>And that's important. Along with the ability to manipulate the devices and information around you, learning a little programming will help you understand how engineers think. If you familiarize yourself with the sausage-making side of computers you'll begin to develop an intuitive understanding of hardware and software interfaces which, as I mentioned, will comprise a larger and larger portion of the world. You'll never have to be one of those hopeless codgers reduced to asking his or her grandkids for help programming the hyper-VCR.</p>
<p>So how should you approach this worthy undertaking? The best way is probably to pick a scripting language and start perusing the materials that are available. But which scripting language? In some ways it doesn't matter — you'll need to learn what a <em>variable</em> is, how an <em>if..then statement</em> works and what a <em>for loop</em> does in any of them. But you may as well hear the nerd scuttlebutt on each and then make an informed choice. So let's look at the big three first:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Perl</dt>
<dd>Perl's one of the oldest scripting languages still in widespread use, and powered much of the early web. Its biggest advantage is probably <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cpan.org/">CPAN</a>, a massive library of add-ons written by people to handle the hard part of whatever neat thing you want to do, whether it's the creation of an IM bot, manipulating Flickr or the automatic generation of charts. It's also very nice for processing text, which, after all, is what the net is mostly comprised of. And because of its age you can find it preinstalled and available on most webhosts and Unix or Mac systems (it's easy to get running on Windows, too).
The knock on Perl is that it's slow and somewhat byzantine. Most importantly, it's relatively hard to read Perl code (much harder than it is to write it), which makes learning by example difficult. As you may have noticed I use Perl a lot for tasks where speed isn't important, both because I'm used to it and because CPAN makes so many excellent tools available.
If you want to learn Perl, I'd recommend that you start by reading the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.perl.org/books/library.html">freely available PDF of the book Beginning Perl</a>.</dd>
<dt>Ruby</dt>
<dd>It's the cool new kid on the block. Ruby's very chic, and is frequently lauded for producing &quot;beautiful&quot; code. It really is a pretty elegant language. It's also the underpinnings of the Ruby On Rails framework, which is a new and very popular way to get a dynamic, database-driven website up and running with minimal effort. Ruby's cool, and is the next language on my list of things to learn.
But it's still a work in progress. It's a little slow, although that's likely to improve. And its RubyGems package manager system — Ruby's version of CPAN — is easy to use, but not yet all that fleshed out. If you want to talk to Flickr, for instance, you'll find that most of the available Gems have serious limitations. It'll get better, though, and these sorts of problems aren't that relevant for beginners.
There are also particularly great learning tools for Ruby, many of them thanks to one man called Why. You should definitely have a look at <a class="reference external" href="http://tryruby.hobix.com/">Try Ruby</a>, an in-browser demonstration of the language that walks you through a basic tutorial. After that, <a class="reference external" href="http://learnruby.com/why">LearnRuby.com</a> is probably the best clearinghouse for traditional learning materials. But if you like your programming primers weird, illustrated and told through elaborate, nonsensical stories, you should absolutely read <a class="reference external" href="http://poignantguide.net/ruby/">Why's (Poignant) Guide To Ruby</a>. It's definitely the strangest programming book I've ever read.</dd>
<dt>Python</dt>
<dd>Python kind of splits the difference. It's not as old as Perl and not as new as Ruby. It's got a lot of tools available for it, but perhaps not as many as Perl (it's better-designed, though). It's got its own <a class="reference external" href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">hot web development framework</a> — one that's not quite as exciting as Rails but seems to have fewer scaling problems. It can be made blazingly fast when necessary — Google uses Python extensively, and it sort of seems like they know what they're doing.
I don't really care for it, though. I tried to learn Python by writing a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.zunta.org/blog/archives/2006/01/15/learning_is_fun/">series of bloggy tutorials</a> way back when. But not only was I not very good at keeping my instruction properly focused, I also didn't end up liking the language very much. The weird markup bugged me (it controls program flow with whitespace in an unusual way), but the sin for which I'll never forgive Python is its awkward syntax for using regular expressions. Regexes are a common feature across languages, and are an <a class="reference external" href="http://www.zunta.org/blog/archives/2006/02/13/files_and_regul/">incredibly powerful way to process text</a>. Python requires a preparatory step before using them; Perl and Ruby don't. For that reason I'm unlikely to dive back into Python.
<a class="reference external" href="http://waste.typepad.com/">Wolfson</a> loves it, though. You may want to talk to him if you're interested in the language — I'm sure he can make a better case for it, and point you toward good resources for learning it.</dd>
</dl>
<p>As I said, those are the big three. There are countless others, but these are the ones that you'll run into the most. They're used all the time to process data and glue applications together. Any one of them would be a fine choice.</p>
<p>But there are a couple of less conventional options that I think you may want to consider, too:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>AppleScript</dt>
<dd>If you have a Mac, you have AppleScript. I don't know it myself, but it's an extremely readable language designed to let you automate tasks on your Mac. The applications it lets you control will be immediately familiar — you'll be able to fetch a webpage with Safari rather than, say, wget or curl. Consequently you may be able to perform impressive feats more quickly than you would with a more general-purpose language. <a class="reference external" href="http://files.macscripter.net/sourcebook/AS4ASb2.pdf">This PDF</a> seems like a good place to start.</dd>
<dt>PHP</dt>
<dd>PHP is widely-used, but generally in a web context (&quot;Hypertext Processor&quot; makes up the final two thirds of the acronym). If you buy a cheap webhosting account, it probably comes with PHP. This entry exists on a page served by PHP. Recent versions of OS X have it installed by default, too.
It's not frequently used for scripts that run for a long time — web pages need to be served quickly, after all. But you can run it from the command line just fine, if you'd like (our previous sysadmin had most of his maintenance scripts written in PHP). You may have to adjust its automatic timeout period upward if you use it this way, though (scripts that take too long to run are automatically terminated by default, since they usually represent a misbehaving web page that's a threat to system performance or stability).
PHP is widely available, fast, easy to read, uses a syntax that's a sort of mutt conglomeration of other languages (rather than an idiosyncratic dead-end), and has a ton of stuff built in — if you want to generate graphics or process PDFs, the functionality is likely already available rather than existing in an add-on you need to install.
PHP has a bad reputation because it's so easy to use — lots of lousy code has been written in it. It's also not object-oriented (although it pretends to be), which is important to professional programmers but mostly irrelevant to beginners. But there's tons of good documentation: nearly every page on <a class="reference external" href="http://www.php.net">PHP.net</a> contains dozens of comments from users offering helpful tips and sample code.
If you think your scripting efforts might primarily end up living on the web, PHP is probably the best choice for you. <a class="reference external" href="http://us2.php.net/tut.php">Here's a good starting point</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<p>That's it. At the very least you should poke through some starter documentation and get a sense of what's involved. You can get a lot done with a relatively small amount of programming knowledge. And of course if you've got a particular question you should feel free to leave a comment or send me an email. As you can probably tell, I'm anxious to share the scripting gospel.</p>
