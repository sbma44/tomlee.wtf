It's nice! I wrote an equivalent bookmarklet right after I wrote that post but didn't distribute it. It wasn't as nice as this Greasemonkey script, either — check out the fancy data-URI-encoded icons on this guy! Anyway, get (and use) it now before they rotate encryption keys and break both of em.</p>
<p>It seems slightly silly to me that the free music sampling position we've arrived at is so delicate and tendentious. Everyone's fiercely guarding their bandwidth and ability to deny liability while tacitly admitting the underlying truth: single tracks are now essentially free, priced only by the amount of inconvenience it takes to obtain them — which is primarily a function of which startup has how much remaining money/lawsuits pending against them. It's all pretty dumb.</p>
<p>A suggestion for the idle Flash developers that I'd like to believe are reading this but probably aren't: how about a <a class="reference external" href="http://blog.delicious.com/blog/2005/11/we_rock_part_2.html">PlayTagger</a>-like application with the following capabilities:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>The ability to take a semicolon-delimited list of URLs for an mp3 link (in the <em>rel</em> attribute or similar) and randomly serve one so as to balance load and bandwidth costs.</li>
<li>HTTP_REFERER header forging; either automatic (root of serving domain) or user-specified.</li>
<li>The ability to scrape HTML pages included in that <em>rel</em> list of URLs and find matching mp3 links based on filename or link text comparison.</li>
<li>Testing links for 404s/30xs; on error, proceed to the next URL specified.</li>
</ol>
<p>It should all be pretty simple stuff, except perhaps for the second and last item — I'm not sure how sophisticated ActionScript's HTTP functionality is. And it'd allow linking to mp3 files in a way that's unlikely to break, unlikely to bankrupt the people hosting the files, and that could be automatically generated without too much trouble.</p>

                    <p>I've just learned that Amazon Prime, the $75/year service that provides free two-day shipping for all purchases from the site, allows users to designate up to five (or so) relations who can also use the program, apparently without much in the way of verification. Anyone want to go in on this together? It's first-come, first-served as far as who gets to be niece, uncle or life partner, though.</p>

<p>It's a video of The Destroyer wrestling a bear, with commentary from the man himself. I think you'll agree he makes a compelling case that that bear should've been disqualified.</p>

                    <p>Look, I like Barack Obama, too. I hope he wins the nomination and becomes our next president. But <a class="reference external" href="http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2008/3/5/14345/50395/126/469746">this stuff</a> about the Clinton campaign altering videotape of him to make him seem blacker is just crazy. Have we all really never seen a political ad before? Here, allow me to summarize the art form for you:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><em>Grainy, black and white footage of Candidate A, stretched extra-wide or extra-tall. The camera slowly zooms in on Candidate A's lips, which move in slow motion but without sound.</em></div>
<div class="line">NARRATOR: Candidate A says he's for [good things]. But according to [somewhat reputable news source] on [date] he said [nuanced opinion]. Maybe that's why [neutral-sounding fringe group] called Candidate A &quot;[outrageous smear]&quot;.</div>
<div class="line"><em>(brief pause)</em></div>
<div class="line">NARRATOR: Candidate A. [misleading interrogatory]?</div>
<div class="line"><em>Cut to wide shot of Candidate B. He is standing in a sunlit alpine valley, surrounded by adorable woodland creatures and an assemblage of attractive, multicultural children. They look up to him expectantly, hoping to absorb the wisdom of their elders so that they, too, might grow up and take their rightful places in the glorious unfolding story that is AMERICA.</em></div>
<div class="line">Candidate B: I'm Candidate B, and I approved this message because [something other than &quot;I owe private industry many favors&quot;].</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>This is how things go. You jack up the contrast, distort the image, slow it down and screw around with the colors because it makes your opponent look generically creepy — not because it accentuates particular racial attributes. For some reason the kossacks are pretending that nobody has ever run video of their opponent through a filter. They're either <a class="reference external" href="http://althouse.blogspot.com/2008/03/why-are-letters-nig-on-childs-pajamas.html">insane</a>, dishonest, or haven't been paying any attention at all. This graphical sniping is common enough that <a class="reference external" href="http://www.snpp.com/episodes/2F02.html">it's been parodied on The Simpsons</a>, for pete's sake.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> More from <a class="reference external" href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2008_03/013281.php">Kevin Drum</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.factcheck.org/elections-2008/did_clinton_darken_obamas_skin.html">FactCheck.org</a>. I hadn't realized that the evidence being cited was coming from different video sources, and that one of them is <em>YouTube</em>, for chrissakes. It's simply impossible to meaningfully identify the sort of subtle trickery that's being alleged when the quality of the evidence is so poor.</p>
<p>With that in mind, a few good litmus tests to apply before opining on these matters: can you succinctly define <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_correction">gamma correction</a>? Have you ever had to figure out what <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_space">color space</a> an image is using? Does <a class="reference external" href="http://spyder.datacolor.com/index_us.php">this</a> look at all familiar? If so, then by all means speak your mind. If not, allow me to gently suggest that you have some wikipedia-reading to do.</p>
<p>After that, get me digital stills from the debate and the ad that were recorded on the same hardware. Only then will it be possible to identify the alleged manipulation as genuinely existing — at which point my previous objections about the likely lack of racial malice surrounding the manipulation will resume applying. Seriously: this is laughably weak stuff.</p>

Scottish accents and melodrama are a winning combination.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>Well, I got hit by a car again. It's pretty stupid, but I thought you should know.</p>
<p>It was Thursday evening, and I was biking home from work. The intersection of 12th and O is a four way stop two blocks from my house — actually three-way, I suppose, since 12th is a one-way street that runs North. I was headed East.</p>
<p>And I was good! My <a class="reference external" href="http://dcist.com/2006/03/19/opinionist_dont.php">cyclist-lawbreaking apologism</a> notwithstanding, in this case I played by the rules. I got to the intersection and stopped, or at least slowed as close to a stop as a bicycle can while maintaining enough gyroscopic mojo to stay upright. The car to my right went through the intersection and I then proceeded. I was surprised to see the next car begin accelerating, but to be honest my first thought was <em>Oh no you're not</em>: this is usually the point at which the driver stops short, and I take smirking pleasure in knowing that another motorist has been shocked and angered by a momentary awareness of drivers' perpetual irresponsibility.</p>
<p>Except this time the car didn't stop. It sped smoothly into my bike's front wheel, flipping me around and depositing me on the pavement. I'm not sure exactly where my body went in relation to the car, but I know the other guy left the intersection without a driver's side mirror.</p>
<p>With characteristic wit I screamed MOTHERFUCKER and wandered shakily out of the intersection. This is the wisdom I can offer about unexpected physical trauma: you're suddenly going to be stuffed full of adrenaline, and that's going to make you quite bad at thinking and evaluating your physical state. The best you can hope for is recognizing your own impairment and prioritizing a few key things. In this case that meant pushing through my sudden kinetic confusion and getting down the car's tags. Because at that moment the driver showed no signs of stopping.</p>
<p>Eventually he did. There was nowhere to go, for one thing — traffic ahead; angry, honking motorists behind. And I'm now inclined to think he was even more shocked and confused than I was (motorists: exactly like bears). He eventually stopped about halfway down the block. I called 911, and there was a cruiser on the scene before I had even hung up. The cop took my statement and that of a nice lady who'd been kind enough to stop, make sure I was okay and then take some photos of the scene.</p>
<p>Eventually the other driver came over. He was an enormously tall African gentleman, seemingly near retirement age. He appeared to be heading home from his job as a security guard, and it looked like he was blind in one eye. He was taciturn, shocked and withdrawn, but through embarrassed mumbles he said he was sorry; he thanked God for protecting me, and hoped aloud that he would bless me further; he said that life is the best, most important thing. He hoped that I would forgive him.</p>
<p>In short, he did not seem to be the type of guy whose personal misfortune could be considered a karmic positive. So although I still felt pretty pissy as we shook hands, I also knew that it wouldn't last. I plan to talk to his insurance company about the $150 worth of attention that my bike needs, and EchoDitto wants me to make some inquiries about their dinged-up laptop, so I guess I'll be doing that. But otherwise the upshot was just a sore knee, shin and shoulder. I still made it onto that evening's 8 p.m. Chinatown bus.</p>
<p>So while I'm dreading the coming insurance-wrangling, it wasn't too bad overall. Certainly it was better than when I got hit by a cop car in high school — that hurt my body and my bike less, but also ended up with me getting a ticket and my dad having to threaten a lawsuit to get the Arlington County Police Department to stop sending us bills for unrelated damage to the cruiser. I think I'm getting a hang of this vehicular catastrophe business, and am hopeful that by the next time I'll really have the routine down pat.</p>
<p>Oh! I should also draw your attention to the lack of &quot;head injury&quot; in my list of woes. I haven't pored over my helmet yet for signs of impact, but this story could've been a lot less happy (although also perhaps less overwritten) if I hadn't been wearing it. So, you know: embrace the dorkiness.</p>

                    <p>Ryan <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ryanavent.com/blog/?p=786">responds</a> to my last post. I appreciate the thoughtful attention, but I can't say that I agree with much of his post.</p>
<blockquote>
I understand what Tomâ€™s saying, but I think heâ€™s missing some key points. He wants to judge a technology in a &quot;pure&quot; world, outside the presence of the market conditions in which it will be sold and used, but you canâ€™t do that. The utility of a technology is inextricably connected to the market conditions in which it will be sold and used. A Beta videotape might clearly be superior on most quality variables, but if a VHS tape is long enough to hold a full-length movie and Beta isnâ€™t, well thatâ€™s important. Saying that length shouldnâ€™t be as important as other variables is pointless; the market didnâ€™t just want &quot;Quality,&quot; it wanted a certain quality.</blockquote>
<p>I was careful not to mention Beta/VHS before because Ryan's exactly right: length vs. quality is reasonable decision to have to make, and one that the market is better positioned to make than I am.</p>
<p>But his larger point is wrong. Yes, the utility of a technology can only be judged in relation to the world at large — more precisely, the world as it currently exists. But a technology absolutely can be judged apart from that, in its own timeless, rarified world. Every engineering discipline develops principles and design patterns by which work can be judged. Technical elegance is a real thing, and it really matters. Something designed well will be reusable, will be extensible, will be, as we sometimes say, &quot;futureproof&quot;.</p>
<p>And the difference between a good and a bad design does not always come with tradeoffs. The components in a DAT cassette deck and a high-end analog cassette deck are pretty similar. DAT has been much less commercially successful. But it is the superior technology. There's just no getting around that. In that case the cost of finding the better solution was time; in other cases it's as simple as giving a damn.</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">&gt;The fact is that in many cases it would be better if those factors were weighted differently.</div>
<div class="line">Emphasis mine. To this, economists will say, &quot;Says who?&quot; But the broader point is this. Tom believes that he can look at a technology and say itâ€™s better or worse than another technology. Economists say he canâ€™t, because Tom doesnâ€™t actually know what the great mass of consumers wants.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>I'll bite: why <em>do</em> I feel so confident saying it would be better if the weighting were different? Well, consider the reason why MS-DOS was successful: it was selected for inclusion on IBM's soon-to-be-blockbuster line of microcomputers. There were a number of similar technologies at the time, and it was up to IBM to choose one. Why MS-DOS? Well, depending on which version of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.freeenterpriseland.com/BOOK/KILDALL.html">the story</a> you subscribe to, it was because Bill Gates' main competitor was late to a meeting, or his wife wouldn't sign an NDA, or, ironically, because the competing system was <em>too successful in the marketplace</em> and its owner — not realizing how valuable or market-changing the IBM deal would be — didn't want to sign over his business for what IBM was offering.</p>
<p>This all made perfect sense at the time. But now, decades later, what has the result been? It would be wrong to assign all of Microsoft's sins to MS-DOS, but the fact remains that the system was unequivocally technically inferior to other operating systems of the day, as judged by those aforementioned engineering principles. And those principles won out, as they almost always do: limitations of MS-DOS that may not have been immediately apparent became evident as technology advanced, and countless amounts of money and effort had to be expended to come up with workarounds, fixes and kludges. In a word: externalities!</p>
<p>How much did that all cost? I have no idea, but it clearly dwarfs the amounts that were being weighed and judged against one another during the IBM-CP/M-MSDOS deal. There's every reason to believe that, had a superficially similar but fundamentally superior technology to MS-DOS been selected, we would all be better off.</p>
<p>Now of course I can't say that definitively. Maybe the productivity gains of an all-Unix world would have been so great that we'd have accidentally opened an interdimensional portal to Dinosaur World by now and all been devoured. Or something. But I can say that the selection of an engineered product carries costs that may not be apparent for years — costs that non-experts are in no position to estimate until they occur. And even experts can generally only say &quot;this was built well&quot; or &quot;this was built poorly&quot;. But in many cases that's enough, and it would save us all a lot of money if we listened to those pronouncements more carefully.</p>
<p>Oh, and one more thing: it's probably worth noting that one of the greatest technical (and economic) triumphs in recent memory — TCP/IP and the suite of other protocols and standards that powers the internet — was designed by having a bunch of really smart engineers get together, execute an RFC process and then issue an ISO standard more or less by fiat. This is not to say that markets can't help us arrive at good solutions — cable vs. DSL vs. FiOS is a good example of such a market working (or would be if the regulatory picture weren't so complicated). But it ought to be acknowledged that markets are not always an optimal tool for making technical decisions. In fact there are now pseudo-centralized organizations that take responsibility for many of the technical standards that power our world, and nearly all engineers agree that we're vastly better off for it.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Tim, who knows considerably more about this than I do, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.techliberation.com/archives/043402.php">corrects my history</a> and explains that TCP/IP <em>did</em> triumph through competition with other protocols. Fair enough! But I think the point stands: even when there is a &quot;competition&quot; stage in drafting a net technology spec — and this is an important function of the RFC process, so there ought to be — it's still true that the selection of the winning ideas/specs is largely isolated from the consumer economy, and with good reason. In cases where the consumer economy inserts itself in the process — e.g. when Microsoft uses its marketshare to undercut the W3C — most people agree that the end result is detrimental. Openness and the winnowing of ideas is important, but when the decisions involve infrastructure the process needs to be restricted to those with some expertise.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>It was very nice of Megan to link to me yesterday (even if the <a class="reference external" href="/2008/02/28/tautologous-but-highly-patentable/#comments">commenters</a> that came along with it proved to be huge pains in the ass). So I hope I won't seem ungrateful if I take issue with <a class="reference external" href="http://meganmcardle.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/02/was_hddvd_done_in_by_a_dirty_d.php">this post</a> about Blu-Ray's eventual triumph over HD-DVD.</p>
<p>Megan's right that I and a lot of my fellow nerds aren't very happy about this outcome, but she's wrong to say that &quot;[e]very time there's a format war, the losers complain that the inferior product won through nefarious methods.&quot; I'm not sure that's a fair characterization. In this case I can admit that Blu-Ray is the technically superior standard. Many technologists didn't like it because it seemed a bit more DRM-laden, because it didn't seem worth the price premium, and because Sony has behaved very badly with respect to proprietary media formats in the past (Redbook/CD excepted, but of course that was a joint venture with Philips). I should say that I don't really have a dog in this fight — I don't own a drive from either camp, and tend to think that we'll only get halfway through this generation of tech before network delivery of video consigns Blu-Ray to a CD-like role (except less useful due to the aforementioned DRM). But that doesn't mean I'm happy with the way things turned out for HD-DVD.</p>
<p>It's not so much that I think there were dirty tricks involved (although there <a class="reference external" href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=08/02/22/1939200">may have been</a>). It's just that it's frustratingly obvious that the factors determining a technology's success frequently have little to do with its capabilities, price, performance or other innate attributes. Rather, they're the result of quirks of the business environment into which the technology is born.</p>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="http://www.reason.com/news/show/29944.html">Reason article that Megan links to</a> irks me much more than her own post, as it consistently fails to understand this. &quot;MS-DOS wasn't an inferior technology that succeeded because of the market landscape and consumers' path dependence,&quot; it says (more or less). &quot;It's just that the licensing environment surrounding IBM PC clones made them cheap, and once consumers started using DOS the costs involved in switching made doing so impractical. So you see, it was the superior technology after all.&quot;</p>
<p>The article does this again and again, most egregiously in the case of Dvorak vs. QWERTY*, where the author desperately tries to establish that actually in all cases the market selects for the optimum technology, always and in perpetuity throughout the universe. I know, I know — if you're a home-row typist you're probably laughing so hard right now that your pinky fell right off the semicolon key. But the argument proceeds anyway, tirelessly pointing out that geek-favored technologies have some downsides, maligned market winners have some upsides, and the way the path-dependent public ultimately chose is proof that the winning tech trumps the former on the merits.</p>
<p>Well, if you define &quot;the merits&quot; as &quot;the sum of all factors facing the public&quot; then yes, that's true. But this amounts to merely asserting that we live in an at least semi-rational universe, which isn't a very useful or original conclusion. The fact is that in many cases it would be better if those factors were weighted differently. As things stand, they're generally configured to serve the interests of the businessmen at the beginning of the process more than the consumers at the end of it, and that's a shame.</p>
<p>I suppose I shouldn't get too upset; this is just a variant on the Libertarian tendency to perpetually declare ours the best of all possible worlds (except for the parts they don't like). But it's still frustrating to read stuff like that Reason article. You just <em>know</em> that the author doesn't use a command line.</p>
<p>* Special bonus sophistry: pointing out methodological errors in pro-Dvorak studies, then buttressing the point with pro-QWERTY studies... full of methodological errors. Unless you <em>really</em> think it's fair to compare the marginal benefit of training to a group of experienced QWERTY typists and newly-trained Dvorak typists.</p>

<p>After watching it a few more times, I'm convinced: that's Stephen fucking Merritt (dammit).</p>
<p>The fascinating thing about this ad is that it's almost exactly as good as any Magnetic Fields song. And I don't mean that as a compliment. Stephen Merritt gets a lot of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.pastemagazine.com/action/article/6243/feature/music/magnetic_fields_searching_for_meaning_in_the_murk">disgustingly adulatory press</a>. I think there are three reasons for this:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>He always sounds bored, which is widely regarded as a sign of sophistication.</li>
<li>His love songs are about dudes, which is considered to be even more sophisticated.</li>
<li>He spends a lot of time talking about how smart he is, which for a variety of reasons is not something that a given music press interviewer is in a position to challenge.</li>
</ul>
<p>But I don't buy it. To me his songs have always seemed long on wit and short on genuine emotion, full of calculated revelations of self-loathing but devoid of actual vulnerability. They're beautiful, cold constructions. They're satirical poems from the Victorian Era, they're the chess column in the paper hummed aloud, they're New Yorker cartoons adapted for Broadway. They might as well be about gum.</p>

                    <p>Yup, still sick, although not as deliriously so as I was over the last four days — this is some bad stuff. Mostly I've been confined to lying on the couch feeling sorry for myself. But Saturday's activities did also include an unexpected win at Scrabble and confirmation of Philadelphia's banh mi supremacy — Emily and I checked out <a class="reference external" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/02/05/AR2008020500888_pf.html">Song Que and Nhu Lan</a>, and though the latter has definitely got something to offer in terms of mayo &amp; bread, both offered insultingly small portions of jalapeno and cilantro. It was still pretty delicious, though. And it's always good to be reminded of how stupid an idea bubble tea is.</p>
<p>I'm still producing much more snot than ideas, so for now I'll just ask: anybody want to go to <a class="reference external" href="http://dorkbot.org/dorkbotdc/">Dorkbot</a> tomorrow night?

                    <p>God dammit. I was feeling good about my prospects this year. Yes, I spent two and a half weeks sick. But so did everyone else! I was just trying to fit in! Besides, that length of time isn't that bad by my historical standards. Generally speaking I spend about every twelfth day of the year coughing or sneezing or otherwise being unpleasant to be around, and doing so in an extremely biological manner. I thought this year's stats would be an improvement.</p>
<p>But this morning I woke up with a 101 degree fever. My eyes stung. My lungs felt like burlap covered with cat hair, and my spine felt like a tube of pantyhose crammed full of pointy garbage. I took a sick day and lord was it ever a good idea.</p>
<p>The afternoon's been filled with cranberry juice and bad science fiction movies (when Henry Rollins and Dolph Lundgren are by far the best actors in a production you know you're looking at a quality piece of cinema). Tomorrow? Well, we'll see.</p>

                    <p>Whoops! We got a DMCA notice at work today from our ISP, and I'm to blame. It was an accident, honest! I had (allegedly!) been downloading episode five of The Wire's current season and neglected to shut off my Bittorrent app before leaving home. Apparently HBO took notice and didn't take kindly to it.</p>
<p>First: I'm currently an HBO subscriber, so I'm feeling pretty karmically okay about all of this.</p>
<p>Second: I may have been downloading a bunch of other season 6 eps at the same time (I had a plane ride ahead of me and catching up to do!) but HBO apparently only noticed the torrent for episode 5 — a lousy torrent made from an HBO screener DVD, incidentally, with horribly clipping audio throughout. It wasn't even the good stuff! It makes me wonder if they're particularly sensitive to leaked screeners.</p>
<p>Third: although I'm being flip, this is still an embarrassing and stupid mistake. The last thing I want to do was expose the company to liability so that I can timeshift my preferred crime dramas. The odds of dire consequences arising from this particular incident seem to be fairly nonexistent, but it's certainly something I want to avoid in the future. Having no faith in myself, I turn to technology.</p>
<p>OS X maintains an app called Kicker that does various things when network events occur — things like changing wifi access points. It also has an XML configuration file you can modify that'll allow you to run your own scripts. Scripts like this one:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="literal-block">
#!/bin/sh
#get the ssid of the network
ssid=`ioreg -l -n AirPortDriver | grep APCurrentSSID | sed 's/^.*= &quot;\(.*\)&quot;.*$/\1/; s/ /_/g'`
#fill in your own values for ssid and location below
if [ $ssid = &quot;YourWirelessNetwork&quot; -o $ssid = &quot;YourOtherWirelessNetwork&quot; ]
then
`killall Transmission`
fi
exit 0
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.transmissionbt.com/">Transmission</a> is the name of the app I use for Bittorrent. You'll want to change that and the wifi network placeholders (capitalization matters!). Then you'll want to save that file somewhere safe and `chmod +x <em>whatever_you_called_it</em>`. Then follow <a class="reference external" href="http://www.macgeekery.com/gspot/2006-05/hacking_kicker_and_configd_to_run_your_scripts">these directions</a> for editing Kicker.xml so that it'll run your script. Voila! The script will run whenever you change networks. It'll check the name of the network and, if there's a match, terminate the Transmission application (potentially messily, I should add — this may be bad for your downloads in progress).</p>
<p>All in all, a pretty clever way to avoid my own stupidity. Hopefully someone else will find it useful, too.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Hmm. After installing this setup I began to experience some pretty weird system blocking errors — most noticeably Terminal.app freezing, but other weirdness, too. You may want to hold off on it for now. I'm giving it another go using a Ruby script that forks immediately in the hopes that this will prevent anything from sticking:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="literal-block">
#!/usr/bin/ruby
pid = fork do
#get the ssid of the network
ssid = `ioreg -l -n AirPortDriver | grep APCurrentSSID | sed 's/^.*= &quot;\(.*\)&quot;.*$/\1/; s/ /_/g'`
#fill in your own values for ssid and location below
if ((ssid =~ /YourWirelessNetwork/i) || (ssid =~ /YourOtherWirelessNetwork/i))
`killall Transmission&amp;`
end
end
</pre>

                    <p>Last Wednesday's annual candy heart rumination aside, I haven't really written much here since getting back from New Orleans. It feels like I've gotten worse and worse at recording what I've been up to, which is of course unfair both to myself and to the historians of the future. So:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>I flew to San Francisco and went to some meetings about a social network for lesbians, where they can be free from the flagrantly heteronormative &quot;poke&quot; frame. Then there was some emergency pre-Valentine's chocolate acquisition and a business development meeting <a class="reference external" href="http://www.slanteddoor.com/">here</a> with a prospective client. For those unfamiliar with the lingo, &quot;business development&quot; means talking about how great the internet is while the company buys you bourbon. It's easier than it probably sounds.
Nicco piloted our top-down rental convertible toward SFO in characteristically terrifying fashion, and soon I was sitting in the airport bar, almost exactly 24 hours after I had landed. I chatted with a nice couple who were in town for some sort of trade show. They expressed amazement at my phone and irritation at having to press one to get English voicemail prompts. I opted to pick my battles and focused on getting the bartender's attention. This proved to be a bad idea.
It didn't seem that way at first. I got on the plane and was pleasantly surprised to find that I had a whole row to myself. I zoned out, then spread out, then passed out. The stumble to the bathroom went okay, but the one coming out didn't turn out as well.
My friend Scott is a medic in the Army. He's got as many mortifyingly hilarious stories as you might expect; some of my favorites are about his training. Mostly these are about doing unpleasant things to goats, but occasionally the trainees just do unpleasant things to each other. In one exercise partners take turns wearing inflatable pressure pants and dosing themselves with vasodilators, then abruptly pull the plug on the pants. If you do this — and I'm not suggesting that you do — all the blood will immediately drop out of the top half of your body and you'll go into shock (this is still a better gig than being an Army goat).
That's pretty much what I felt like as I stumbled down the aisle, hung over, sleep deprived, blinded by the lavatory lights and generally out of it. I pawed at some unfortunate passengers' heads, desperately searching for any empty row that could plausibly be my own. It felt very, very good when I found one and collapsed into it. I woke up long enough to curse the Pittsburgh airport, then got home and slept through half the day.</li>
<li>Also, I had super-birth-valentine's-day-stravaganza! I turned 28 on Friday, but was too busy being spoiled rotten by Emily to really notice. For Valentine's we went to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.saltandpepperphilly.com/">Salt &amp; Pepper</a>, where they fed us well and plied us with port and grappa. We went to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.southwarkrestaurant.com/">Southwark</a> afterward and did some self-plying. The birthday-day was even better (probably because I had no part in planning it): we went to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.dockstreetbeer.com/">Dock Street</a> and ate fancy pizza with some fine folks, saw <em>Jumper</em>, and grabbed a drink at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.chickscafe.com/">Chick's</a>. I can recommend all of these things highly (although I admit I may be confusing the actual movie <em>Jumper</em> with the abstract concept of teleportation).
Then: DC! Dave &amp; Buster's! Giant stuffed frogs! My thanks to everybody who dared venture into what is probably the most hostile environment not currently being considered for hosting an international peacekeeping force. I had a great time, but it turns out that friends are better for talking to than they are for enlistment into ad-hoc anti-zombie strike forces (no offense, guys). So this is perhaps not going to be the first installment of an annual tradition. On the other hand, I still have an awful lot of credits on my Power Card...</li>

                    <p>I meant to talk about the new evidence that biofuels are a bad idea when <a class="reference external" href="http://www.brianbeutler.com/2008/02/corn_woes/">Brian first wrote about it</a>, but I forgot. Today <a class="reference external" href="http://matthewyglesias.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/02/flipflop_needed.php">Matt mentioned it</a>, and I was reminded that virtually everyone is ignoring a key aspect of the biofuel land use debate. If I may quote the beginning of the cover story in the current issue of the excellent <a class="reference external" href="http://www.brewingnews.com/mid-atlantic/">Mid-Atlantic Brewing News</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Blame drought in Australia and rain in Europe. Blame increased interest in ethanol as an energy source.</div>
<div class="line">Even blame the growing popularity of beer in China.</div>
<div class="line">Those—and more—are reasons to expect higher beer prices in 2008, and why some brewers will be unable to make some beers no matter how strong the consumer demand. Craft brewers face what more than one calls &quot;a perfect storm&quot; of higher costs and reduced availability for both the hops and malt used to make their beers.</div>
<div class="line">&quot;Prices are going to go up... there's just no doubt about it,&quot; predicts Jim Busch of Downingtown, Pa.'s Victory Brewing Co. &quot;And some brands will disappear. Other brands will just totally change in their character.&quot;</div>
<div class="line">&quot;Brewer owners are going to have to raise their prices,&quot; agrees Russian River Brewing Co. founder and brewer Vinnie Cilurzo in Santa Rosa, Calif., &quot;just to stay in business.&quot;</div>
<div class="line">&quot;I think this year will be, to use the Chinese curse phrase, 'interesting,'&quot; comments Hugh Sisson, president of Baltimore's Clipper City Brewing Co.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>The threat is real, people. You know <a class="reference external" href="http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/3620/2898/">Tupper's Hop Pocket</a>, right? Well, not this year you won't — ingredient prices have made it not viable to produce.</p>
<p>So, to summarize: changing global climate; baseless biofuel enthusiasm; and the terrifying prospect of a nation's worth of people who look different from use dragging themselves out of poverty — all of these forces are conspiring to make your favorite brand of beer marginally more expensive and/or taste a little less like pine needles.</p>
<p>And what are our prospective presidential nominees doing about this looming crisis? Nothing. There was only one man prepared to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.dennis4president.com/go/issues/a-sustainable-future/">stop global climate change</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.desmoinesregister.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071106/NEWS09/711060402">approach biofuels with appropriate skepticism</a>, and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/14759/candidates_on_us_policy_toward_china.html#261">exact merciless economic punishment upon the Chinese</a> for drinking beer (instead of attending to human rights). That's right — it was <a class="reference external" href="http://www.satyamag.com/nov03/beerintro.html">Dennis Kucinich: the Beer Candidate</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for our nation's future, this truth has become apparent too late. Hell, I would've done my best to support a Department of Peace with a straight face if only he'd explicitly pledged to keep beer prices low. I used to think it was just the former that couldn't occur without the latter; now I see that it works both ways.</p>
