                    <p>Hey there. I'm no longer in Puerto Rico! Oh, right, I should've mentioned: Emily and I are going to Puerto Rico. Were going. Sorry. You know what I mean.</p>
<p>Despite what I will immodestly call an impressive series of attempts to ruin the vacation, I was ultimately unsuccessful and we ended up having a great time. Beaches so pristine as to border on cliche; rutted dirt roads weaving through palm trees and abandoned bunkers; a full assortment of rum, both spiced and regular. We were basically living in a Corona commercial for five days, except with mercifully few Corona drinkers around us.</p>
<p>It's taking an effort to avoid writing thousands more words about it right now, so I'd best cut this short while I still can. I'll have more to say once timesheets have been filled out and some lidocaine/aloe solution acquired. For now I'll just point out that the Caribbean is exactly as nice as you've been led to believe, and if you aren't booking tickets there <em>right now</em> you're not using your computer to optimal effect.</p>

It's nice! I wrote an equivalent bookmarklet right after I wrote that post but didn't distribute it. It wasn't as nice as this Greasemonkey script, either — check out the fancy data-URI-encoded icons on this guy! Anyway, get (and use) it now before they rotate encryption keys and break both of em.</p>
<p>It seems slightly silly to me that the free music sampling position we've arrived at is so delicate and tendentious. Everyone's fiercely guarding their bandwidth and ability to deny liability while tacitly admitting the underlying truth: single tracks are now essentially free, priced only by the amount of inconvenience it takes to obtain them — which is primarily a function of which startup has how much remaining money/lawsuits pending against them. It's all pretty dumb.</p>
<p>A suggestion for the idle Flash developers that I'd like to believe are reading this but probably aren't: how about a <a class="reference external" href="http://blog.delicious.com/blog/2005/11/we_rock_part_2.html">PlayTagger</a>-like application with the following capabilities:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>The ability to take a semicolon-delimited list of URLs for an mp3 link (in the <em>rel</em> attribute or similar) and randomly serve one so as to balance load and bandwidth costs.</li>
<li>HTTP_REFERER header forging; either automatic (root of serving domain) or user-specified.</li>
<li>The ability to scrape HTML pages included in that <em>rel</em> list of URLs and find matching mp3 links based on filename or link text comparison.</li>
<li>Testing links for 404s/30xs; on error, proceed to the next URL specified.</li>
</ol>
<p>It should all be pretty simple stuff, except perhaps for the second and last item — I'm not sure how sophisticated ActionScript's HTTP functionality is. And it'd allow linking to mp3 files in a way that's unlikely to break, unlikely to bankrupt the people hosting the files, and that could be automatically generated without too much trouble.</p>

<p>It's a video of The Destroyer wrestling a bear, with commentary from the man himself. I think you'll agree he makes a compelling case that that bear should've been disqualified.</p>

                    <p>Look, I like Barack Obama, too. I hope he wins the nomination and becomes our next president. But <a class="reference external" href="http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2008/3/5/14345/50395/126/469746">this stuff</a> about the Clinton campaign altering videotape of him to make him seem blacker is just crazy. Have we all really never seen a political ad before? Here, allow me to summarize the art form for you:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><em>Grainy, black and white footage of Candidate A, stretched extra-wide or extra-tall. The camera slowly zooms in on Candidate A's lips, which move in slow motion but without sound.</em></div>
<div class="line">NARRATOR: Candidate A says he's for [good things]. But according to [somewhat reputable news source] on [date] he said [nuanced opinion]. Maybe that's why [neutral-sounding fringe group] called Candidate A &quot;[outrageous smear]&quot;.</div>
<div class="line"><em>(brief pause)</em></div>
<div class="line">NARRATOR: Candidate A. [misleading interrogatory]?</div>
<div class="line"><em>Cut to wide shot of Candidate B. He is standing in a sunlit alpine valley, surrounded by adorable woodland creatures and an assemblage of attractive, multicultural children. They look up to him expectantly, hoping to absorb the wisdom of their elders so that they, too, might grow up and take their rightful places in the glorious unfolding story that is AMERICA.</em></div>
<div class="line">Candidate B: I'm Candidate B, and I approved this message because [something other than &quot;I owe private industry many favors&quot;].</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>This is how things go. You jack up the contrast, distort the image, slow it down and screw around with the colors because it makes your opponent look generically creepy — not because it accentuates particular racial attributes. For some reason the kossacks are pretending that nobody has ever run video of their opponent through a filter. They're either <a class="reference external" href="http://althouse.blogspot.com/2008/03/why-are-letters-nig-on-childs-pajamas.html">insane</a>, dishonest, or haven't been paying any attention at all. This graphical sniping is common enough that <a class="reference external" href="http://www.snpp.com/episodes/2F02.html">it's been parodied on The Simpsons</a>, for pete's sake.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> More from <a class="reference external" href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2008_03/013281.php">Kevin Drum</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.factcheck.org/elections-2008/did_clinton_darken_obamas_skin.html">FactCheck.org</a>. I hadn't realized that the evidence being cited was coming from different video sources, and that one of them is <em>YouTube</em>, for chrissakes. It's simply impossible to meaningfully identify the sort of subtle trickery that's being alleged when the quality of the evidence is so poor.</p>
<p>With that in mind, a few good litmus tests to apply before opining on these matters: can you succinctly define <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_correction">gamma correction</a>? Have you ever had to figure out what <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_space">color space</a> an image is using? Does <a class="reference external" href="http://spyder.datacolor.com/index_us.php">this</a> look at all familiar? If so, then by all means speak your mind. If not, allow me to gently suggest that you have some wikipedia-reading to do.</p>
<p>After that, get me digital stills from the debate and the ad that were recorded on the same hardware. Only then will it be possible to identify the alleged manipulation as genuinely existing — at which point my previous objections about the likely lack of racial malice surrounding the manipulation will resume applying. Seriously: this is laughably weak stuff.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>Well, I got hit by a car again. It's pretty stupid, but I thought you should know.</p>
<p>It was Thursday evening, and I was biking home from work. The intersection of 12th and O is a four way stop two blocks from my house — actually three-way, I suppose, since 12th is a one-way street that runs North. I was headed East.</p>
<p>And I was good! My <a class="reference external" href="http://dcist.com/2006/03/19/opinionist_dont.php">cyclist-lawbreaking apologism</a> notwithstanding, in this case I played by the rules. I got to the intersection and stopped, or at least slowed as close to a stop as a bicycle can while maintaining enough gyroscopic mojo to stay upright. The car to my right went through the intersection and I then proceeded. I was surprised to see the next car begin accelerating, but to be honest my first thought was <em>Oh no you're not</em>: this is usually the point at which the driver stops short, and I take smirking pleasure in knowing that another motorist has been shocked and angered by a momentary awareness of drivers' perpetual irresponsibility.</p>
<p>Except this time the car didn't stop. It sped smoothly into my bike's front wheel, flipping me around and depositing me on the pavement. I'm not sure exactly where my body went in relation to the car, but I know the other guy left the intersection without a driver's side mirror.</p>
<p>With characteristic wit I screamed MOTHERFUCKER and wandered shakily out of the intersection. This is the wisdom I can offer about unexpected physical trauma: you're suddenly going to be stuffed full of adrenaline, and that's going to make you quite bad at thinking and evaluating your physical state. The best you can hope for is recognizing your own impairment and prioritizing a few key things. In this case that meant pushing through my sudden kinetic confusion and getting down the car's tags. Because at that moment the driver showed no signs of stopping.</p>
<p>Eventually he did. There was nowhere to go, for one thing — traffic ahead; angry, honking motorists behind. And I'm now inclined to think he was even more shocked and confused than I was (motorists: exactly like bears). He eventually stopped about halfway down the block. I called 911, and there was a cruiser on the scene before I had even hung up. The cop took my statement and that of a nice lady who'd been kind enough to stop, make sure I was okay and then take some photos of the scene.</p>
<p>Eventually the other driver came over. He was an enormously tall African gentleman, seemingly near retirement age. He appeared to be heading home from his job as a security guard, and it looked like he was blind in one eye. He was taciturn, shocked and withdrawn, but through embarrassed mumbles he said he was sorry; he thanked God for protecting me, and hoped aloud that he would bless me further; he said that life is the best, most important thing. He hoped that I would forgive him.</p>
<p>In short, he did not seem to be the type of guy whose personal misfortune could be considered a karmic positive. So although I still felt pretty pissy as we shook hands, I also knew that it wouldn't last. I plan to talk to his insurance company about the $150 worth of attention that my bike needs, and EchoDitto wants me to make some inquiries about their dinged-up laptop, so I guess I'll be doing that. But otherwise the upshot was just a sore knee, shin and shoulder. I still made it onto that evening's 8 p.m. Chinatown bus.</p>
<p>So while I'm dreading the coming insurance-wrangling, it wasn't too bad overall. Certainly it was better than when I got hit by a cop car in high school — that hurt my body and my bike less, but also ended up with me getting a ticket and my dad having to threaten a lawsuit to get the Arlington County Police Department to stop sending us bills for unrelated damage to the cruiser. I think I'm getting a hang of this vehicular catastrophe business, and am hopeful that by the next time I'll really have the routine down pat.</p>
<p>Oh! I should also draw your attention to the lack of &quot;head injury&quot; in my list of woes. I haven't pored over my helmet yet for signs of impact, but this story could've been a lot less happy (although also perhaps less overwritten) if I hadn't been wearing it. So, you know: embrace the dorkiness.</p>

                    <p>Ryan <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ryanavent.com/blog/?p=786">responds</a> to my last post. I appreciate the thoughtful attention, but I can't say that I agree with much of his post.</p>
<blockquote>
I understand what Tomâ€™s saying, but I think heâ€™s missing some key points. He wants to judge a technology in a &quot;pure&quot; world, outside the presence of the market conditions in which it will be sold and used, but you canâ€™t do that. The utility of a technology is inextricably connected to the market conditions in which it will be sold and used. A Beta videotape might clearly be superior on most quality variables, but if a VHS tape is long enough to hold a full-length movie and Beta isnâ€™t, well thatâ€™s important. Saying that length shouldnâ€™t be as important as other variables is pointless; the market didnâ€™t just want &quot;Quality,&quot; it wanted a certain quality.</blockquote>
<p>I was careful not to mention Beta/VHS before because Ryan's exactly right: length vs. quality is reasonable decision to have to make, and one that the market is better positioned to make than I am.</p>
<p>But his larger point is wrong. Yes, the utility of a technology can only be judged in relation to the world at large — more precisely, the world as it currently exists. But a technology absolutely can be judged apart from that, in its own timeless, rarified world. Every engineering discipline develops principles and design patterns by which work can be judged. Technical elegance is a real thing, and it really matters. Something designed well will be reusable, will be extensible, will be, as we sometimes say, &quot;futureproof&quot;.</p>
<p>And the difference between a good and a bad design does not always come with tradeoffs. The components in a DAT cassette deck and a high-end analog cassette deck are pretty similar. DAT has been much less commercially successful. But it is the superior technology. There's just no getting around that. In that case the cost of finding the better solution was time; in other cases it's as simple as giving a damn.</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">&gt;The fact is that in many cases it would be better if those factors were weighted differently.</div>
<div class="line">Emphasis mine. To this, economists will say, &quot;Says who?&quot; But the broader point is this. Tom believes that he can look at a technology and say itâ€™s better or worse than another technology. Economists say he canâ€™t, because Tom doesnâ€™t actually know what the great mass of consumers wants.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>I'll bite: why <em>do</em> I feel so confident saying it would be better if the weighting were different? Well, consider the reason why MS-DOS was successful: it was selected for inclusion on IBM's soon-to-be-blockbuster line of microcomputers. There were a number of similar technologies at the time, and it was up to IBM to choose one. Why MS-DOS? Well, depending on which version of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.freeenterpriseland.com/BOOK/KILDALL.html">the story</a> you subscribe to, it was because Bill Gates' main competitor was late to a meeting, or his wife wouldn't sign an NDA, or, ironically, because the competing system was <em>too successful in the marketplace</em> and its owner — not realizing how valuable or market-changing the IBM deal would be — didn't want to sign over his business for what IBM was offering.</p>
<p>This all made perfect sense at the time. But now, decades later, what has the result been? It would be wrong to assign all of Microsoft's sins to MS-DOS, but the fact remains that the system was unequivocally technically inferior to other operating systems of the day, as judged by those aforementioned engineering principles. And those principles won out, as they almost always do: limitations of MS-DOS that may not have been immediately apparent became evident as technology advanced, and countless amounts of money and effort had to be expended to come up with workarounds, fixes and kludges. In a word: externalities!</p>
<p>How much did that all cost? I have no idea, but it clearly dwarfs the amounts that were being weighed and judged against one another during the IBM-CP/M-MSDOS deal. There's every reason to believe that, had a superficially similar but fundamentally superior technology to MS-DOS been selected, we would all be better off.</p>
<p>Now of course I can't say that definitively. Maybe the productivity gains of an all-Unix world would have been so great that we'd have accidentally opened an interdimensional portal to Dinosaur World by now and all been devoured. Or something. But I can say that the selection of an engineered product carries costs that may not be apparent for years — costs that non-experts are in no position to estimate until they occur. And even experts can generally only say &quot;this was built well&quot; or &quot;this was built poorly&quot;. But in many cases that's enough, and it would save us all a lot of money if we listened to those pronouncements more carefully.</p>
<p>Oh, and one more thing: it's probably worth noting that one of the greatest technical (and economic) triumphs in recent memory — TCP/IP and the suite of other protocols and standards that powers the internet — was designed by having a bunch of really smart engineers get together, execute an RFC process and then issue an ISO standard more or less by fiat. This is not to say that markets can't help us arrive at good solutions — cable vs. DSL vs. FiOS is a good example of such a market working (or would be if the regulatory picture weren't so complicated). But it ought to be acknowledged that markets are not always an optimal tool for making technical decisions. In fact there are now pseudo-centralized organizations that take responsibility for many of the technical standards that power our world, and nearly all engineers agree that we're vastly better off for it.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Tim, who knows considerably more about this than I do, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.techliberation.com/archives/043402.php">corrects my history</a> and explains that TCP/IP <em>did</em> triumph through competition with other protocols. Fair enough! But I think the point stands: even when there is a &quot;competition&quot; stage in drafting a net technology spec — and this is an important function of the RFC process, so there ought to be — it's still true that the selection of the winning ideas/specs is largely isolated from the consumer economy, and with good reason. In cases where the consumer economy inserts itself in the process — e.g. when Microsoft uses its marketshare to undercut the W3C — most people agree that the end result is detrimental. Openness and the winnowing of ideas is important, but when the decisions involve infrastructure the process needs to be restricted to those with some expertise.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>It was very nice of Megan to link to me yesterday (even if the <a class="reference external" href="/2008/02/28/tautologous-but-highly-patentable/#comments">commenters</a> that came along with it proved to be huge pains in the ass). So I hope I won't seem ungrateful if I take issue with <a class="reference external" href="http://meganmcardle.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/02/was_hddvd_done_in_by_a_dirty_d.php">this post</a> about Blu-Ray's eventual triumph over HD-DVD.</p>
<p>Megan's right that I and a lot of my fellow nerds aren't very happy about this outcome, but she's wrong to say that &quot;[e]very time there's a format war, the losers complain that the inferior product won through nefarious methods.&quot; I'm not sure that's a fair characterization. In this case I can admit that Blu-Ray is the technically superior standard. Many technologists didn't like it because it seemed a bit more DRM-laden, because it didn't seem worth the price premium, and because Sony has behaved very badly with respect to proprietary media formats in the past (Redbook/CD excepted, but of course that was a joint venture with Philips). I should say that I don't really have a dog in this fight — I don't own a drive from either camp, and tend to think that we'll only get halfway through this generation of tech before network delivery of video consigns Blu-Ray to a CD-like role (except less useful due to the aforementioned DRM). But that doesn't mean I'm happy with the way things turned out for HD-DVD.</p>
<p>It's not so much that I think there were dirty tricks involved (although there <a class="reference external" href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=08/02/22/1939200">may have been</a>). It's just that it's frustratingly obvious that the factors determining a technology's success frequently have little to do with its capabilities, price, performance or other innate attributes. Rather, they're the result of quirks of the business environment into which the technology is born.</p>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="http://www.reason.com/news/show/29944.html">Reason article that Megan links to</a> irks me much more than her own post, as it consistently fails to understand this. &quot;MS-DOS wasn't an inferior technology that succeeded because of the market landscape and consumers' path dependence,&quot; it says (more or less). &quot;It's just that the licensing environment surrounding IBM PC clones made them cheap, and once consumers started using DOS the costs involved in switching made doing so impractical. So you see, it was the superior technology after all.&quot;</p>
<p>The article does this again and again, most egregiously in the case of Dvorak vs. QWERTY*, where the author desperately tries to establish that actually in all cases the market selects for the optimum technology, always and in perpetuity throughout the universe. I know, I know — if you're a home-row typist you're probably laughing so hard right now that your pinky fell right off the semicolon key. But the argument proceeds anyway, tirelessly pointing out that geek-favored technologies have some downsides, maligned market winners have some upsides, and the way the path-dependent public ultimately chose is proof that the winning tech trumps the former on the merits.</p>
<p>Well, if you define &quot;the merits&quot; as &quot;the sum of all factors facing the public&quot; then yes, that's true. But this amounts to merely asserting that we live in an at least semi-rational universe, which isn't a very useful or original conclusion. The fact is that in many cases it would be better if those factors were weighted differently. As things stand, they're generally configured to serve the interests of the businessmen at the beginning of the process more than the consumers at the end of it, and that's a shame.</p>
<p>I suppose I shouldn't get too upset; this is just a variant on the Libertarian tendency to perpetually declare ours the best of all possible worlds (except for the parts they don't like). But it's still frustrating to read stuff like that Reason article. You just <em>know</em> that the author doesn't use a command line.</p>
<p>* Special bonus sophistry: pointing out methodological errors in pro-Dvorak studies, then buttressing the point with pro-QWERTY studies... full of methodological errors. Unless you <em>really</em> think it's fair to compare the marginal benefit of training to a group of experienced QWERTY typists and newly-trained Dvorak typists.</p>

                    <p><a class="reference external" href="http://thecityveins.com/">Charles</a> just sent me <a class="reference external" href="http://idolator.com/361972/is-stephin-merritt-absolutely-cuckoo-for-spearmint-and-wintergreen">this link</a> which contains the following commercial, over which he and I have been scratching our heads for the past week or so:</p>
<p>After watching it a few more times, I'm convinced: that's Stephen fucking Merritt (dammit).</p>
<p>The fascinating thing about this ad is that it's almost exactly as good as any Magnetic Fields song. And I don't mean that as a compliment. Stephen Merritt gets a lot of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.pastemagazine.com/action/article/6243/feature/music/magnetic_fields_searching_for_meaning_in_the_murk">disgustingly adulatory press</a>. I think there are three reasons for this:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>He always sounds bored, which is widely regarded as a sign of sophistication.</li>
<li>His love songs are about dudes, which is considered to be even more sophisticated.</li>
<li>He spends a lot of time talking about how smart he is, which for a variety of reasons is not something that a given music press interviewer is in a position to challenge.</li>
</ul>
<p>But I don't buy it. To me his songs have always seemed long on wit and short on genuine emotion, full of calculated revelations of self-loathing but devoid of actual vulnerability. They're beautiful, cold constructions. They're satirical poems from the Victorian Era, they're the chess column in the paper hummed aloud, they're New Yorker cartoons adapted for Broadway. They might as well be about gum.</p>

<p>That's right: someday soon scientists may be working to develop a pill that can mimic the placebo effect.</p>
<p>Personally, I find this immensely cheering. I think I love this universe the most when it's operating at maximum ridiculousness.</p>

                    <p>Yup, still sick, although not as deliriously so as I was over the last four days — this is some bad stuff.

                    <p>God dammit. I was feeling good about my prospects this year. Yes, I spent two and a half weeks sick. But so did everyone else! I was just trying to fit in! Besides, that length of time isn't that bad by my historical standards. Generally speaking I spend about every twelfth day of the year coughing or sneezing or otherwise being unpleasant to be around, and doing so in an extremely biological manner. I thought this year's stats would be an improvement.</p>
<p>But this morning I woke up with a 101 degree fever. My eyes stung. My lungs felt like burlap covered with cat hair, and my spine felt like a tube of pantyhose crammed full of pointy garbage. I took a sick day and lord was it ever a good idea.</p>
<p>The afternoon's been filled with cranberry juice and bad science fiction movies (when Henry Rollins and Dolph Lundgren are by far the best actors in a production you know you're looking at a quality piece of cinema). Tomorrow? Well, we'll see.</p>

                    <p>Whoops! We got a DMCA notice at work today from our ISP, and I'm to blame. It was an accident, honest! I had (allegedly!) been downloading episode five of The Wire's current season and neglected to shut off my Bittorrent app before leaving home. Apparently HBO took notice and didn't take kindly to it.</p>
<p>First: I'm currently an HBO subscriber, so I'm feeling pretty karmically okay about all of this.</p>
<p>Second: I may have been downloading a bunch of other season 6 eps at the same time (I had a plane ride ahead of me and catching up to do!) but HBO apparently only noticed the torrent for episode 5 — a lousy torrent made from an HBO screener DVD, incidentally, with horribly clipping audio throughout. It wasn't even the good stuff! It makes me wonder if they're particularly sensitive to leaked screeners.</p>
<p>Third: although I'm being flip, this is still an embarrassing and stupid mistake. The last thing I want to do was expose the company to liability so that I can timeshift my preferred crime dramas. The odds of dire consequences arising from this particular incident seem to be fairly nonexistent, but it's certainly something I want to avoid in the future. Having no faith in myself, I turn to technology.</p>
<p>OS X maintains an app called Kicker that does various things when network events occur — things like changing wifi access points. It also has an XML configuration file you can modify that'll allow you to run your own scripts. Scripts like this one:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="literal-block">
#!/bin/sh
#get the ssid of the network
ssid=`ioreg -l -n AirPortDriver | grep APCurrentSSID | sed 's/^.*= &quot;\(.*\)&quot;.*$/\1/; s/ /_/g'`
#fill in your own values for ssid and location below
if [ $ssid = &quot;YourWirelessNetwork&quot; -o $ssid = &quot;YourOtherWirelessNetwork&quot; ]
then
`killall Transmission`
fi
exit 0
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.transmissionbt.com/">Transmission</a> is the name of the app I use for Bittorrent. You'll want to change that and the wifi network placeholders (capitalization matters!). Then you'll want to save that file somewhere safe and `chmod +x <em>whatever_you_called_it</em>`. Then follow <a class="reference external" href="http://www.macgeekery.com/gspot/2006-05/hacking_kicker_and_configd_to_run_your_scripts">these directions</a> for editing Kicker.xml so that it'll run your script. Voila! The script will run whenever you change networks. It'll check the name of the network and, if there's a match, terminate the Transmission application (potentially messily, I should add — this may be bad for your downloads in progress).</p>
<p>All in all, a pretty clever way to avoid my own stupidity. Hopefully someone else will find it useful, too.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Hmm. After installing this setup I began to experience some pretty weird system blocking errors — most noticeably Terminal.app freezing, but other weirdness, too. You may want to hold off on it for now. I'm giving it another go using a Ruby script that forks immediately in the hopes that this will prevent anything from sticking:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="literal-block">
#!/usr/bin/ruby
pid = fork do
#get the ssid of the network
ssid = `ioreg -l -n AirPortDriver | grep APCurrentSSID | sed 's/^.*= &quot;\(.*\)&quot;.*$/\1/; s/ /_/g'`
#fill in your own values for ssid and location below
if ((ssid =~ /YourWirelessNetwork/i) || (ssid =~ /YourOtherWirelessNetwork/i))
`killall Transmission&amp;`
end
end
</pre>
