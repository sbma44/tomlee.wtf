<p>I'm supposed to spend 12 hours in Vienna along the way, so if anyone has any particularly good ideas about how to utilize a brief Austrian lunchtime interlude, please let me know.&nbsp; I half-suspect those hours will be used up on tortuous sleep in the airport: normally I would be feeling good about my prospects for rest during the flight, having just bought the CVS generic antihistamine with the most severe-sounding warning about operating heavy machinery that I could find.&nbsp; But I came down with a cold this weekend, and am several years older than the last time I dealt with serious jetlag, and generally suspect that waking up early could kill me.</p>
<p>Despite this, it should be fun!&nbsp; I'm looking forward to seeing Georgia, a country that's possessed an incredible mystique for me ever since I read Susan's writing about it (more recent reports from my colleague Ryan have done nothing to diminish the myth).&nbsp; It's a little strange to be leaving the office so soon after getting back from Costa Rica, but I think the trip is going to be worth the disruption.</p>
<p>And yes, I haven't yet written up any of the additional Costa Rica blog posts I intend to write.&nbsp; I still intend to write them!&nbsp; Who knows, hotel-bound paralysis born of pathetic language skills just might make it happen...</p>

                    <p><a class="reference external" href="http://motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2010/03/you-and-your-browser">Kevin Drum elects to take security advice from Microsoft</a>. This is not a good idea!</p>
<p>In a nutshell: MS says that users ignore warnings about unsigned encryption keys, which makes those warnings useless.&nbsp; Some browsers, like Firefox, make it <em>really difficult</em> to ignore unsigned keys, but that's annoying, and MS says we should abandon such efforts.</p>
<p>This is wrong.&nbsp; Those warnings are saying: &quot;The URL you entered means that you've asked for a snoop-proof connection, so okay, your connection to this server is encrypted; however, <em>I can't verify that this server is who it's claiming to be</em>.&quot;&nbsp; Your conversation with the server will be private, but you could be subject to a so-called man-in-the-middle attack, whereby someone hijacks the local network segment you're on and starts speaking on behalf of, say, bankofamerica.com.&nbsp; The magic of the certificate authority system means that they can't do this without generating a warning.</p>
<p>There is one caveat: if they simply don't try to use encryption, the warning won't be generated.&nbsp; This is one of the reasons why you're supposed to check for <a class="reference external" href="https://">https://</a> in the URL whenever you submit sensitive information; not just so that your password isn't available to everyone else on the Bolt Bus (though that's a good reason, too), but also so that anyone pretending to be a server they're not will get caught.&nbsp; Unfortunately, people aren't very good at checking for that little s in the URL or that little key icon or whatever other little security indicator your browser provides, so the bad guys just direct their victims to unsecured sites.</p>
<p>That's too bad, but it isn't a sign that warnings about unsigned keys are bad ideas.&nbsp; Actually, the fact that phishers have drifted away from that link in the security chain means that <em>it's working properly</em>.&nbsp; Weakening it isn't any kind of solution.&nbsp; MS security researchers would be better-served by spending more time thinking about how to get people to notice when they ought to be using a secure site.</p>

<p>I read the article, though, and found myself disagreeing with its author, Marisa Meltzer.&nbsp; How can you provide an accounting of Tumblr's success and not use the word &quot;Gawker&quot; once?&nbsp; The service was launched in New York in the right kind of scene, was pitched in the right kind of way, attracted the right kind of writers, and grew from there. Like so many successful products, you can't simply run Tumblr's featureset backward through the perfectly-deterministic mechanism of the imagined market and arrive at a proper accounting of why it succeeded and its competitors failed.</p>
<p>I agree that it's worth talking about the subtle mechanics of the site -- how there's a thumbs-up mechanism but no thumbs-down; I think the consolidation of reader and blog into a single form is a genuinely interesting idea. But Meltzer's account seemed to me a bit like explaining the success of the iPod via a discussion of its clickwheel.</p>

                    <p>Oh! Hello there! I'm not in Costa Rica any more, it turns out.&nbsp; Actually, I've been back since Saturday evening, but I've been too busy growing an entirely new layer of skin to write anything here.&nbsp; That process is now wrapping up, which leaves just the photo editing and fighting with Picasa-to-Flickr uploading (but then it turned out to be a network proxy problem) and then realizing that my <a class="reference external" href="/2006/10/26/fun-with-lightbox-and-booze/">Flickr/Lightbox gallery script</a> didn't make it past the move to Wordpress, and considering writing a WP plugin to fix it but then deciding to try out a half dozen until I finally found <a class="reference external" href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/flickr-tag/installation/">this one</a> which does what I want. Whew.</p>
<p>What? Right, Central America.&nbsp; Emily and I just spent 7 days in Costa Rica, driving through mountains, clouds and grids of oil palms, attempting the full volcano/cloud forest/beach trifecta.&nbsp; I want to write about each of those things, but for now you'll have to be satisfied with some pictures.</p>

Sommer asked that I be on the lookout for another kit that might be a good candidate for learning to solder. I eventually suggested another Lady Ada kit: the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ladyada.net/make/mintyboost/">MintyBoost</a>, a simple circuit that lets you top up your USB gadgets' batteries through the use of a pair of AAs. By the time I got my act together, six(!) people had expressed interest in building the kit, pushing supplies of my tools (somewhat scarce) and electronics knowledge (decidedly meager) to their limits.</p>
<p>But it went surprisingly well! Everyone's kit worked immediately; in fact, they even seemed to work with the iPhone 3GSes that were on hand -- something that <a class="reference external" href="http://forums.adafruit.com/viewtopic.php?f=15&amp;t=11661">the MintyBoost can't necessarily be relied upon to do</a>.</p>

<p>I think that folks had fun; we might do this again, perhaps with more of an Arduino bent. If you want in, let me know.</p>

                    <p>A few weeks back Emily and I were out at Bob &amp; Barbara's having some drinks with our friends Sarah, John Carlos and Tara. We got to talking about art and technology and sculpture, and with the help of my phone John Carlos found a video of some work he'd done.&nbsp; The bar wasn't the best place for watching it, so I emailed it to myself and forgot about it until just now:</p>

<p>The look is just as bespoke, concentrated and confusing as his description had implied, and the noise it makes every bit as terrible as Tara had promised.&nbsp; I think it's great.</p>

<p>Charles and I have been watching the Olympics avidly, as it's provided a welcome and unexpected outlet for the violent anti-Canadian sentiment that we hadn't even realized was building up inside us, poisoning our hearts and minds. <em>They think they're so great. Or at least, they think they're okay, but will resolve to try harder.</em> Those bastards.</p>
<p>The Olympics come with various apocryphal stories, most having to do with athletes overcoming personal adversity.&nbsp; But Charles also heard a good one about the South Korean speed skating team's training regimen.&nbsp; Supposedly they're in the habit of doing interval training where they sprint for 40 seconds, then walk for 20, then repeat the cycle seven more times.&nbsp; Charles said he'd tried it and it was a surprisingly exhausting way to spend 8 minutes.</p>
<p>I can back that up.&nbsp; When I was done with my first attempt, I could swear I tasted blood.&nbsp; I kept walking around the track for what seemed like forever, afraid to let my heart rate drop to the level it desperately wanted to.&nbsp; Eventually I was fine, though I felt like I had completely exfoliated the inside of my lungs.&nbsp; <em>Man</em>, was it exhausting.&nbsp; And I was cheating, using 30 second rests!</p>
<p>Perhaps your cardiovascular system is not as pathetic as my own (I hope not; these lungs have proven to be serious underperformers).&nbsp; Either way, this is worth a try.&nbsp; And as a bonus, it produces an unusually bumpy and cool-looking heart rate graph, captured courtesy of the neat Garmin monitoring doohickey that Emily bought for me a year ago (that first peak is from me climbing up the six floors to the YMCA's indoor track).</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>Matt has <a class="reference external" href="http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/archives/2010/02/is-the-universe-a-hologram-should-we-care.php">graciously responded</a>, pointing me toward a <a class="reference external" href="http://consc.net/papers/matrix.html">David Chalmers essay</a> that I think I've skimmed in the past. Revisiting it, I think I didn't express the question I'm wondering about clearly enough.&nbsp; Chalmers (and Matt) seem to basically be saying that it's not worth letting Cartesian hypotheticals keep you up at night, no matter how irrefutably plausible they may be.&nbsp; I agree!</p>
<p>But what I find interesting about the holographic hypothesis is what Chalmers dismisses at the end of this passage:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Computational Hypothesis says that physics as we know it not the fundamental level of reality. Just as chemical processes underlie biological processes, and microphysical processes underlie chemical processes, something underlies microphysical processes. Underneath the level of quarks and electrons and photons is a further level: the level of bits. These bits are governed by a computational algorithm, which at a higher-level produces the processes that we think of as fundamental particles, forces, and so on.</p>
<p>The Computational Hypothesis is not as widely believed as the Creation Hypothesis, but some people take it seriously. Most famously, Ed Fredkin has postulated that the universe is at bottom some sort of computer. More recently, Stephen Wolfram has taken up the idea in his book <em>A New Kind of Science</em>, suggesting that at the fundamental level, physical reality may be a sort of cellular automata, with interacting bits governed by simple rules. And some physicists have looked into the possibility that the laws of physics might be formulated computationally, or could be seen as the consequence of certain computational principles.</p>
<p>One might worry that pure bits could not be the fundamental level of reality: a bit is just a 0 or a 1, and reality can't really be zeroes and ones. Or perhaps a bit is just a &quot;pure difference&quot; between two basic states, and there can't be a reality made up of pure differences. Rather, bits always have to be implemented by more basic states, such as voltages in a normal computer.</p>
<p>I don't know whether this objection is right. I don't think it's completely out of the question that there could be a universe of &quot;pure bits&quot;. But this doesn't matter for present purposes. We can suppose that the computational level is itself constituted by an even more fundamental level, at which the computational processes are implemented. It doesn't matter for present purposes what that more fundamental level is. All that matters is that microphysical processes are constituted by computational processes, which are themselves constituted by more basic processes. From now on I will regard the Computational Hypothesis as saying this.</p>
<p>I don't know whether the Computational Hypothesis is correct. But again, I don't know that it is false. The hypothesis is coherent, if speculative, and I cannot conclusively rule it out.</p>
<p>The Computational Hypothesis is not a skeptical hypothesis. If it is true, there are still electrons and protons. On this picture, electrons and protons will be analogous to molecules: they are made up of something more basic, but they still exist. Similarly, if the Computational Hypothesis is true, there are still tables and chairs, and macroscopic reality still exists. It just turns out that their fundamental reality is a little different from what we thought.</p>
<p>The situation here is analogous to that with quantum mechanics or relativity. These may lead us to revise a few &quot;metaphysical&quot; beliefs about the external world: that the world is made of classical particles, or that there is absolute time. But most of our ordinary beliefs are left intact. Likewise, accepting the Computational Hypothesis may lead us to revise a few metaphysical beliefs: that electrons and protons are fundamental, for example. But most of our ordinary beliefs are unaffected.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Those &quot;few metaphysical beliefs&quot; are important, though! Contrary to what Chalmers implies, similar fundamental discoveries in other domains have, in fact, greatly informed our concept of how consciousness operates.&nbsp; The understanding that the brain is the seat of the mind; and that neuronal firing is essential to its function; and that that function can be mediated by drugs or damage which can alter reported phenomenal experience and, we have strong reason to suspect, the mind itself -- these may all be philosophically irrelevant from Chalmers' perspective, as none of these have seriously shaken our faith in personal agency or qualia or the integrity of the conceptual world we inhabit or anything like that.&nbsp; Chalmers would probably not go this far, but I think personal experience has an irresistible, biologically-determined immediacy, and the practical, personal psychological upshot of our discoveries about consciousness seems almost certain to be minimal.&nbsp; Being alive is going to keep seeming the way it currently does.</p>
<p>But the aforementioned discoveries did give us some good clues about the limits of consciousness (its time resolution, for instance), and avenues for thinking about how to create it artificially, and how morally concerned we should be about canned tuna's dolphin-safe status. Certainly they blew dualism right out of the water (as far as most people are concerned).&nbsp; It seems like the truth of the holographic hypothesis -- and that we experience ourselves as part of the holographic projection and not of the underlying lower-dimensional brane -- could also have some implications for how we think about, say, the possibility of panpsychism.</p>
<p>Or maybe not!&nbsp; My aim is not to imply that the HH could be cause for a &quot;nothing is real!&quot;-style freakout, but I do think there might be more meat here than Matt's first impression implies.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the most likely explanation is that I'm fundamentally misunderstanding (or New Scientist misconstruing) the HH.</p>

<p>* I realize that all of these sound like the sort of nonsense that freshmen would ponder while stoned.&nbsp; But that's only half right: it's not actually nonsense.</p>

                    <p>I just put up a post over at the Sunlight Labs blog detailing <a class="reference external" href="http://www.sunlightlabs.com/blog/2010/our-door-opener-science-project/">the electronic adventures involved in getting our office door on the network</a>.&nbsp; Still to come: a post detailing how my colleagues made the system accessible via iPhone, Droid, and plain-ol' telephone system (with an assist from <a class="reference external" href="http://www.twilio.com">Twilio</a>). I still need to solder in a bypass capacitor -- the circuit's not performing <em>quite</em> as securely as it did in the breadboard (although with a door made of glass it's not like we're securing Fort Knox).&nbsp; But in general I'm really pleased with how this project turned out.</p>

                    <p>(Spoilers ahead)</p>
<p>Emily and I saw it on Valentine's Day, and although its lack of sexy vampires meant it was starting at a disadvantage vis a vis other werewolf movies, it was still fairly good.&nbsp; In fact, for the first third of the movie it was just about everything you could want from a werewolf movie.&nbsp; The moors were misty, the townspeople were appropriately panicky, and the beast -- unspoken, unseen -- was terrifying.</p>
<p>Anthony Hopkins is especially good -- stacked up against a bunch of lesser and/or less professionally diligent actors, it becomes immediately apparent just how real a quality charisma is.&nbsp; He does a great job as the obvious Colonel Kurtz figure, telegraphing the coming action to the audience in a dread-inducing way while keeping his character's status close enough to ambiguity that the rest of the cast's &quot;oh I think maybe he's just depressed&quot; treatment of him remains plausible.&nbsp; Hell, for the first act even Benicio del Toro seems okay, if you allow yourself to succumb to the tempting fantasy that his puffy, waxy aristocrat is being played that way to better contrast with his coming bestial descent. Actually, though, it turns out he's just a bad actor!&nbsp; Or doesn't give a shit.&nbsp; Either way.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, things degrade once the filmmakers let the werewolves out of Scotland.&nbsp; The Victorian London on display is even less imaginative than the one from <em>The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen</em>.&nbsp; And, <a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/al3x/status/9082789161">as al3x points out</a>, a proper werewolf demands a snout.&nbsp; I get that they were intentionally sticking with the classic wolfman look, but it really needed more of an update from that &quot;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.cinemaretro.com/uploads/wolfman2.jpg">I would have combed my hair if I knew I was going to be photographed</a>&quot; look.</p>
<p>The movies does nothing with the tension-creating dynamics of the rules surrounding werewolf transformations.&nbsp; The feints toward the destroying-someone-you-love theme that's essential to werewolf stories seem half-hearted. The first act culminates in a fantastic scene at a gypsy camp, but everything else involving the gypsies turns out to be a red herring.&nbsp; In fact, everything after that scene is either completely banal and straightforward, or a half-assed fakeout that does nothing but waste your time and attention.&nbsp; And Hugo Weaving continues to annoy and disappoint me whenever he's not playing a computer.</p>
<p>But man, what could've been! Really, the first third is very well done, and well worth sitting through when it arrives on HBO.&nbsp; Hopefully by then you'll be able to stream <em>Dog Soldiers</em> off Netflix, and you can turn off the later parts of <em>Wolfman</em> in favor of that.</p>
