<div class="line">But no dice. We tried Toys R Us, we browsed Best Buy, we searched Circuit City and we trolled Target. Oh, and Charles called Costco. It's sold out everywhere. If I hadn't had quite such an exciting Saturday night — writing CSS till 3amWOOOO! — I might've gotten up early and stood in line with the other dorks and managed to get my hands on one of the just-released consoles.

<div class="line">But it'll be okay. Word on the interstreet is that most stores will be getting another shipment by Tuesday (if not earlier).

<div class="line">First, my blogging performance. Work is taking nearly every waking moment, and will continue to do so through Monday. It stinks.</div>
<div class="line">Second: Glenn Beck, as noted by Mike Boyer via <a class="reference external" href="http://cyrusfarivar.com/blog/?p=1185">Cyrus</a>. I happened to catch Beck's exchange with representative-elect Keith Ellison while I was at the gym the other day, and it was pretty disgusting. As quoted by Boyer, here's how Beck started off the interview with Ellison, who is our country's first Muslim congressman:</div>
</div>
<blockquote>
OK. No offense, and I know Muslims. I like Muslims. I've been to mosques. I really don't believe that Islam is a religion of evil.... With that being said, you are a Democrat ... what I feel like saying is, 'Sir, prove to me that you are not working with our enemies.' And I know you're not. I'm not accusing you of being an enemy, but that's the way I feel, and I think a lot of Americans will feel that way.</blockquote>
<p>If my memory's right, Boyer's ellipses are a little unfair. Beck prefaced his comments by pointing out that Ellison favors a &quot;cut and run&quot; strategy in Iraq. So this ridiculousness was at least in part motivated by Ellison daring to have opinions about foreign policy that differ from those of a learned cable news anchor — it wasn't <em>entirely</em> about Ellison's religion. Still, there's no denying that Beck was saying to a democratically-elected representative: <em>the burden of proof is upon you to prove that you're not a traitor. Go!</em> It was kind of astounding.</p>

                    <p>Well, I've been trying. My attempts to find new music usually come in fits and starts — Pitchfork's <a class="reference external" href="http://pitchforkmedia.com/page/best_new_music">best new music section</a> is generally pretty reliable, but sometimes they spend months and months in genres that I'm not interested in (or my RSS subscription to the section breaks which l, uh, just discovered it had). When that happens it's time to hit up the music blogs and take some shots in the dark.</p>
<p>I did that, and I grabbed the new Decemberists, too. Unfortunately, the results were kind of disappointing. It could be that I just need to give these albums a few more listens. Or my unfavorable impression may have been due to my <a class="reference external" href="http://www.etymotic.com/ephp/er6.aspx">fancy-pants earphones</a> being in the shop for service yet again (yes, I'm a snob), leaving me to listen through muddy $10 wraparounds that I bought at CVS out of desperation. Whatever the reason, the following failed to adequately whelm me:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt><strong>Pony Up! - Make Love To The Judges With Your Eyes</strong></dt>
<dd>Inspired by <a class="reference external" href="http://cliptip.blogspot.com/2006/12/pony-up-truth-about-cats-and-dogs-is.html">this</a> cliptip post, I gave this band a try. They've got the songs but not the production. The album sounds like a well-made demo tape — there's a lot of potential, but the execution is uninspired. All they really need is a pro in the studio, forcing them to play through each composition like it's going to be the last pop song before the world ends. I'll check in next album (or maybe next tour).</dd>
<dt><strong>The Decemberists - The Crane Wife</strong></dt>
<dd>Colin Meloy's epic ornithophiliac triptych gets off to a rockin' start. But it drags, it's pretentiously out-of-order (and that's in addition to the Decemberists' normal baseline of pretension), and what's up with combining parts one and two into a single track? Do the Decemberists really think they're going to single-handedly turn the tide against the ipodification of their industry? Cause, uh, they won't, regardless of how many <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Crane-Wife-Odds-Bodkin/dp/0152014071/sr=8-2/qid=1163563676/ref=pd_bbs_2/002-0432362-5412058?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books">Japanese birdfucking myths</a> they reference. And given that, I'd prefer that they stop screwing up my meticulous playlist management.</dd>
<dt><strong>Cold War Kids - Robbers and Cowards</strong></dt>
<dd>To my ears these guys sort of sound like the Arctic Monkeys, except tired. Given that I'm not a big Arctic Monkeys fan, that's enough to consign them to my ipod harddrive reclamation efforts. Also, I'm bothered by the fact that the first thing I ever read about this band was in the context of complaints that they were getting too much blog-buzz. Same thing with <a class="reference external" href="http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/index.php/I_am_in_your_base_killing_your_d00ds">this meme</a>. I think internet fads now occur at such a speed that they can only be observed as they destructively collide with boredom, sending particles of ennui and ascii skittering across [STRIKEOUT:a bubble chamber] BoingBoing.</dd>
</dl>
<p>So that's the current, sad state of my attempts at musical exploration. I can legitimately recommend the Annuals album, though (as Caralyn noted <a class="reference external" href="http://fillygrrrl.blogspot.com/2006/10/should-i-stay-with-dear-brother-at.html">here</a>). And hey, you haven't worked all the way through <a class="reference external" href="http://dceiver.blogspot.com/2006/11/october-top-20.html">this list</a> yet, have you?</p>
<p>ALSO MUSICALLY RELATED!: Is that Rhett Miller singing the latest Chili's commercial? A: Yes, <a class="reference external" href="http://music.netscape.com/story/2006/10/26/rhett-miller-sings-about-chilis-baby-back-ribs/">yes it is</a>.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/79877130&#64;N00/24180245"><img alt="photo of Geno's Steaks by flickr user davechiu" src="/static/2006/11/12/20061112_genos.jpg" /></a>Last weekend Sommer came up to Philadelphia to hang out with Emily and myself (okay, mostly Emily). That weekend remains undocumented, although I do have a blockbuster post about brains in jars planned (it was a good weekend).</p>
<p>This weekend it was Kriston and Kate's turn, and we had a grand ol' time, with lots drinking, eating, a competitive pie-off, and a visit to the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.phillyjazz.org/bobbarb.html">Pabstiest Place On Earth</a> (with special guests The Oldest Jazz Band Ever). It was great.</p>
<p>The weekend also featured the completion of a Philadelphian obligation that I had somehow, until now, escaped: cheesesteaks. Kate was attending the Mütter Museum with a friend, but on Saturday Emily, Kriston and I wended our way through the Italian market and on to the center of cheesesteak culture in Philadelphia (and therefore the universe).</p>
<p>Pat's and Geno's Steaks sit across the street from one another, and are by far the most famous purveyors of gristle and cheese in the city. Native Philadelphians don't seem to like to admit loyalty to either — doing so would betray a lack of nuance, revealing the speaker as an unserious person who hadn't considered the science and philosophy of cheesesteaks in a careful and dispassionate way. Needless to say, this quest for knowledge is deeply personal — tourists are not invited — so instead of giving you a straight answer they'll generally just pick a family member's name at random and pretend that it's an actual steak-purveyor (&quot;Yeah, those places are okay, but you've really got to have a steak from Uncle Joe's&quot;).</p>
<p>But Pat's and Geno's were the obvious entry points for cheesesteak philistines like ourselves. Besides, they were nearby. So that's where we headed.</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://flickr.com/photos/lhoon/150998789/"><img alt="photo of Pat's Steaks by Flickr user LHOON" src="/static/2006/11/12/20061112_pats.jpg" /></a>The two businesses look very different. Geno's is a neon abomination: whored out in orange and sporting a co-branded Harley dealership, it's an obvious affront to the Heavens, challenging God to strike down earthly, steak-begotten pride. Pat's is considerably more sedate, offering amiable signage and little other decoration. It looks like the type of place you'd imagine Texan high school football players take their girlfriends immediately before accidentally knocking them up.</p>
<p>But the differences aren't just superficial; there's also the question of politics. It's hard to miss the giant placards outside Geno's that memorialize Officer Daniel Faulkner, who, the reader is helpfully informed, was &quot;murdered by Mumia Abu-jamal&quot; in 1981. Of course, vehement opposition to a cause celebre of the far left isn't proof of anything — but it isn't a very good sign. More conclusive: the notices by the order window aggressively asserting that patrons must order in English because this is America (dammit), and that failure to do so may result in service being refused. There's even a newspaper clipping with a photo of the owner proudly pointing at the sign, as if to say, &quot;Hey, check out what an enormous asshole I am! I think it's <em>great</em>.&quot; Needless to say, we avoided Geno's.</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://flickr.com/photos/gregscher/181969149/"><img alt="photo of Geno's rightwing signs by by Flickr user greg s." src="/static/2006/11/12/20061112_speakenglish.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Admittedly, Pat's is not as expressly ideological; I have no proof that their politics are more in keeping with my own than Geno's. However, buying a steak at Pat's involves spending so much time standing in line — and in so many <em>different</em> lines — that I feel comfortable identifying the management as fellow travelers (Geno's has multiple lines, too, but they have more of an airport security screening/All-American feel to them).</p>
<p>After a slow but successful Saturday experience at Pat's I had expected to be able to avoid Geno's permanently and entirely. But Kriston and Kate wanted to get a last-minute steak as we headed out of town, and the line at Pat's was imposing. We put on our best Walmart-shopper faces and headed to Geno's, where we promptly acquired sandwiches and tried to find a seat that hadn't been covered by the depressing sick that had been falling from the sky all day.</p>
<p>We were only fifty yards from Pat's, but it felt much, much father than that. The line had expanded while we placed our orders, filled out by Eagles fans coming for a post-game snack. The Eagles had just decimated the Redskins, but these fans didn't look happy. Maybe they were still smarting from Senator Santorum's recent defeat; maybe Clinton Portis' broken hand hadn't satisfied their bloodlust. Whatever it was, their eyes uniformly shone with obliviousness, anger, or a combination of the two. It suddenly seemed very cold, and we ate in silence, resisting the urge to compare the meal to Pat's and thereby alert the mob to the presence of outsiders. I remember thinking: <em>this is how Anne Frank must have felt when she ate cheesesteaks.</em></p>
<p>We finished, climbed in the car and escaped into the rain-soaked evening. So, the verdict? Well, Pat's had better bread, and their battered, Burger King-style fries were — although objectively unremarkable — superior to Geno's completely uninspired frites. But the most obvious difference was the sandwich: Pat's chopped the steak, resulting in a gooey mass that seemed more like a confused cheeseburger than a sandwich in its own right. Geno's kept the steak whole, which initially inspired confidence but ultimately backfired due to my having a more precise awareness of exactly what I was eating.</p>
<p>If I had to choose I guess I'd cast my lot with Pat's, even before considering the political dimension. But mostly I have to vote for c), None of the above. The sandwich at Geno's reminded me that I used to eat cheesesteaks all the time: they fed them to us with regularity in Arlington public schools. And they were fucking <em>gross</em>. The meals I had at Geno's and Pat's weren't much different from those awful school lunches — except each cost $11 instead of $1.35. Next time I'll stick with the jumbo sliceria at the market's north end.</p>

<div class="line">I'm a little worried, though — Rusty's resolve <a class="reference external" href="http://whyihatedc.blogspot.com/2006/10/late-night-shots-party-crash.html">seems to be faltering</a>. Be strong, comrade! And realize that these people were probably expecting you, and almost <em>certainly</em> said nasty things about you after you left. The devil will be pleasing in his appearance (the picture to the right notwithstanding).</div>
<div class="line">Anyway, I'm sure that the LNS crowd has a full Wonkette crisis response initiated. I've no doubt that they're superficially peeved, but secretly deeply, deeply satisfied. First: people paying attention! The board's denizens must be glamorous and interesting after all. Second: the obvious response is to hatch secret conspiracies. This incursion by the outside world represents a chance to set up new, more exclusive inner circles, in a flurry of private-messaging between the idiot children of the American aristocracy. It's an opportunity to purge the undesirables from the LNS boards — and you've gotta love a good purge. Let a thousand electronic Skull and Bones bloom!</div>

<div class="line">Atrios <a class="reference external" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/bRuz/~3/47154871/2006_11_05_atrios_archive.html">notes</a> that Tradesports completely failed to predict the outcome in the senate. In some ways, it's unfair to use control of the senate to criticize the idea of non-financial futures markets. In this case, we're talking about a very small range of possible outcomes and a situation that was genuinely hard to predict. All Tradesports said was that the Republicans were 70% likely to retain control. That probability has to collapse into reality at some point, and 30% is nothing to sneeze at. It just didn't work out this time.</div>
<div class="line">But I'm glad to crow about this failure, because I've been seeing more and more references to Tradesports on sites I read, and they're almost always unilluminating — or they're at least frustrating, since I have no idea who and how many participate in these markets. Apologies to my journalist friends — I realize that graphs from online futures markets are one of the greatest labor-saving devices to hit your profession since the invention of Lexis Nexis or Larry Sabato. But they're still sort of boring-slash-infuriating.</div>
<div class="line">As far as I can see, all that these markets get you is an honest effort on the part of their participants. Homerism and marketing within such systems become dramatically more expensive than such practices are elsewhere, which discourages dishonest behavior. That could certainly be useful when it comes to predicting sports outcomes or box office grosses or any number of other endeavors where prognosticators could have a motivation to deceive or insufficient motivation to carefully evaluate the problem.</div>
<div class="line">But when it comes to things like <a class="reference external" href="http://www.wired.com/news/politics/0,1283,59818,00.html">terrorism</a> or <a class="reference external" href="http://hurricanefutures.miami.edu/">hurricanes</a>, the futures market idea seems incoherent to me — unless you believe in its particular brand of magic (many open source enthusiasts are guilty of this, I should note, but they're no less wrong to do so). Experts in these rarified fields are presumably already doing their best to make objective predictions based upon all the data they can find: there are career-related mechanisms in place to encourage them to do so. Adding more voices and weighting them by cash on hand seems unlikely to be as useful as listening to and evaluating the justifications behind each voice's prediction.</div>
<div class="line">Basically, I don't see how you can divorce the qualifications of the contributor from the valuation placed upon his or her opinion. A desire to make money may be enough to qualify someone to predict how the Wizards are going to do, but I don't really see how it could help me figure out when a hurricane is going to make landfall.</div>
<div class="line">Admittedly, political outcomes seem more suited to the idea... but not in this case! So yeah: get bent, futures markets. Arguments make for more interesting reading than market graphs ever will.</div>

<div class="line">Well, things are winding down. The candidates have gone to bed, nobody's releasing new election results, and all that's really left is for someone to unplug the Chris Matthewsbot and drape him with his protective dust cover. I'm pretty optimistic about my home state's chances of banishing George Allen and his pathetically small lizardbrain to the wilds of the Commonwealth (or California — it's time to reconnect with your roots, George). But the senate is just barely, tantalizingly, within reach. I won't jinx it. I'm not optimistic. But I'm hopeful.</div>
<div class="line">I'm just catching up with all of the election-watching now, I'm afraid. I went to go see Broken Social Scene with Catherine, so most of my election updates came via text message and anxious web browsing on my sidekick (good job on mobile accessibility, CNN.com!).</div>
<div class="line">The band was pretty good, overall. When they resisted the temptation to succumb to jam-band awfulness, they were great: &quot;Ibi Dreams Of Pavement&quot; and a countrified version of &quot;Major Label Debut&quot; were both genuinely fantastic. &quot;It's All Gonna Break&quot; was pretty good too, although trying to make a song that's so sprawlingly enormous and of-the-moment even bigger and more spontaneous rendered it just a little silly. Still, I love horn-induced catharsis.</div>
<div class="line">On the other hand, the untitled, minutes-long batch of noodling before IAGB — when a guitarist stubbornly tried to create feedback that didn't want to come and a bass player tried out his new guitar to no one's amusement but his own — that shit was simply infuriating. I was walking out when they stopped and started playing &quot;It's All Gonna Break&quot; — that made me turn around. But I was genuinely disgusted: $33 should buy you something better than a jam session. I've sat through a <em>Disco Biscuits</em> show before (it's a long story), and by god I'm not going to do it again. I wasn't disappointed with the show, but I didn't stick around for an encore.</div>
<div class="line"><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I almost forgot! Also on stage was DC's own <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Canty">Brendan Canty</a>, fulfilling the terms of his plea agreement (namely, that he participate in every musical project, anywhere, forever). Woooo DC!</div>

<p>I'm home now. Claire McCaskill is about to go on TV. Chris Matthews keeps saying &quot;Missurrah&quot; for some reason, as if it's a word (the Missourians speaking on TV seem to disagree with him) . I'm thinking seriously about bed. Here's hoping I wake up to a uniformly Democratic legislature. McCaskill just claimed victory; Tester's up by several points with 2/3rds reporting; and I have childlike faith in my home state. I've got a sneaking suspicion that tomorrow morning is going to be <em>great</em>.</p>

<div class="line">I'm about to head off to vote, but before I do, one additional thought on the election — and this one has almost nothing to do with helicopters.</div>
<div class="line">This <a class="reference external" href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/010880.php">robocalling</a> <a class="reference external" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/06/AR2006110601103.html">business</a>? It's going to get much, much worse. Frankly, I'm a little bit surprised that the NRCC is so obviously to blame for these sleazy tactics. The technology necessary to make automated calls is now within the grasp of any hobbyist:</div>
</div>
<blockquote>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Download <a class="reference external" href="http://www.asterisk.org">Asterisk</a> (it's free). Installation is pretty simple by opensource standards, but if it's still too daunting, there are liveCDs <a class="reference external" href="http://www.voip-info.org/wiki-Asterisk+Bootable+CDROM">available</a>.</li>
<li>Set up an outbound account with a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.vitelity.net/">cheap bulk-termination provider</a> — this is what lets you turn internet traffic from your installation of Asterisk into actual phone calls on the public switched telephone network. Minimum buy-in for these services is usually around $15. Credit can be purchased with a VISA giftcard or, in many cases, with PayPal. I haven't tried buying this sort of thing anonymously, but, having gone through the process legitimately several times, I don't see what would stop you. Outbound calls cost around 1.3 cents/minute and turnaround on new accounts is usually instantaneous.</li>
<li>Get some phone numbers to call. I'm sure there are databases you can buy, but you could also just randomly generate numbers with the right area code.</li>
<li>Record a disenfranchising message. Maybe you warn that back taxes or delinquent parking tickets will be collected at the polling place. Or maybe you direct voters to a new, nonexistent polling place. It's not hard — it just takes a little bit of imagination and a computer with a microphone.</li>
<li>Write a dial plan that dials a number and plays your message. Write a script to autolaunch this dialplan over and over, working through your list of numbers. This takes a little bit of know-how, but is well within the reach of anyone who can get an A or a B in CS101. It'd take 20 lines of code, tops.</li>
<li>Run your nefarious scheme. Using a purloined wifi connection might be tricky — you generally have to open up ports on the router to let the VoIP traffic go through properly. But if you drive around looking for access points named &quot;linksys&quot; you'll probably be able to find a few with the <a class="reference external" href="http://defaultpassword.com">default administrative password</a> unchanged. Go in, open up the ports and you're all set — you can run your robodialer from a laptop plugged into your car's cigarette lighter.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">It's all pretty easy. And it's only going to get easier over the next two years.</div>
<div class="line">Now, consumer bandwidth isn't up to NRCC levels of malfeasance. But you should at least be able to make a few dozen phone calls simultaneously over a broadband connection. And since these calls don't have to be very long, you could easily chew through thousands of voters over the course of the time window when your tactic is likely to be both effective and immune to press coverage. Get a few wackos doing this and you might actually be able to affect turnout. For municipal elections it would probably be very easy to have an effect without getting caught.</div>
<div class="line">So am I worried about this? Maybe a little. But there's no going back, and the big boys are already misbehaving — I don't particularly mind if the process gets democratized. I suspect that it'll soon become common wisdom that you ought to ignore your phone during the week before an election. Sure, it'd be nice to see the FCC take action. But they're awfully busy with indecency complaints, broadcast flags and bungled cableCARD/HDTV transitions. I'm afraid we're going to have to muddle through this ourselves.</div>

<div class="line">Wow. The past seven days have been pretty hectic — so much so that I'm a little shocked to see that it's been a week since I posted something here. Weird. Even more troubling, I haven't even been able to play with my <a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/44137303&#64;N00/286872273">new toy</a> (I'm referring to the microcontroller).</div>
<div class="line">Well, hopefully it'll calm down a bit. Election day is a good, decisive marking point. My subconscious thinks so, anyway: I've been having election dreams.</div>
<div class="line">It's pretty unusual for me. I don't dream very often — not in a way that's coherent enough to remember, at least. But these were vivid and occurred in quicker succession than I'm used to.</div>
<div class="line">The first one involved the deaths of both <a class="reference external" href="http://dccharles.blogspot.com">Charles</a>' mom and <a class="reference external" href="http://cruelsommer.blogspot.com">Sommer</a>. Although tragic, details remain fuzzy about the fate of the former. But I can say with confidence that Sommer died in a horrific rocket attack (delivered via helicopter) on a George Allen rally. What was she doing there? I'll leave it to Sommer to explain herself.</div>
<div class="line">The second dream was a bit weirder. I was in an airport departure lounge, getting ready to be shipped off to Iraq with a number of friends, Starship-Troopers-style. Only we weren't going to fight enormous insectoid aliens, or even Iraqis. Instead we were being sent as media grunts, drafted against our will to report fluff pieces with a pro-America spin. More specifically, we were all divvied up to produce television segments on the different member nations in the so-called <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinational_force_in_Iraq#List_of_nations_in_the_Coalition">Coalition of the Willing</a>. I got <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eritrea">Eritrea</a>, which is not actually a part of the aforementioned coalition. I was understandably worried about finding an angle for my reports.</div>
<div class="line">Both dreams were weirdly affecting. I woke up from the first one despairing, genuinely unsure of whether the narrative's victims were alive or not. I woke up from the second one furious (although this was admittedly more because of some frustrating in-dream boarding pass problems I'd had with security than because I was being forced to sugarcoat a monstrously immoral war — that part was dandy).</div>
<div class="line">Now, I'm no expert at dream interpretation. It's possible that my subconscious is actually more preocuppied with helicopters and TV news than with the election. But having <em>any</em> sort of political backdrop to my unwaking escapades is pretty weird, particularly given their rarity.</div>
<div class="line">So, for what little it's worth: I suspect we'll only get four seats in the senate. Because the universe is unjust, and it seems likely to me that at least one race will be swung by a last-minute helicopter attack.</div>

<div class="line">I'm trying to decode some metro cards for a DCist post in the vein of the the one where I <a class="reference external" href="http://www.dcist.com/archives/2005/12/14/dissecting_the.php">pulled apart a SmarTrip card</a>. But decoding magstripe data is a little harder than splashing around some acetone and plagiarizing wikipedia's RFID article.</div>
<div class="line">I started off trying to use <a class="reference external" href="http://stripesnoop.sourceforge.net/">this project</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://stripesnoop.sourceforge.net/hardware/reader.html">this reader</a>. And it works great for most of the cards in my wallet — but not for metro cards. Strangely, this problem even occurs in raw mode, where the reader simply spits out ones and zeros. The blocks of digits occur in roughly the same places, but the sizes of these blocks aren't consistent.</div>
<div class="line">I've done some googling. From what I can tell, it looks like most financial institutions use a standard encoding scheme, complete with checksums and well-known formats. The stripesnoop reader and software expect this scheme, but DC metro cards don't abide by it. In fact, they may not even be digital: apparently some older card systems are acoustic, using various overlapping frequencies to encode data (the same way that telephone touchtones do).</div>
<div class="line">Anyway, I'm hopeful that <a class="reference external" href="http://www.sephail.net/articles/magstripe/">this software</a> will be up to the task of analyzing it. It's a little more bare-bones: you hook a magnetic read head up to your sound card, record the sound of the magstripe and the software analyzes the resulting wav file. This is why I made that request for breakable tape decks — big thanks to <a class="reference external" href="http://wryandstanley.blogspot.com/">Ray</a> for providing a suitable victim (and to <a class="reference external" href="http://ficke.blogspot.com">Matt</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.jeffnye.org">Jeff</a> for similar offers).</div>
<div class="line">At the very least I've managed to get a motor out of it and a useful-looking transformer that will probably prove to be even more dangerous than I suspect. But I'd say that odds of successfully decoding a card are low. If I can just produce some weird-sounding mp3s I'll call this project a resounding success.</div>

<div class="line">I'm not sure why, but tech-heavy art seems to drive me insane. I've got an <a class="reference external" href="http://grammarpolice.net/archives/001105.php#comments">irrational hatred</a> of Cory Arcangel, and stuff like <a class="reference external" href="http://www.t11s.com/erase.html">this</a> infuriates me (I mean, <a class="reference external" href="http://andrewhitchcock.org/index.pl?page=binladen">c'mon</a>). Watch the video on <a class="reference external" href="http://www.t11s.com/fishpain.html">this page</a> and see if you don't feel the same sense of baffling disorientation that I do.</div>
<div class="line">I'll happily admit that my knowledge of art is confined to the few scraps of ARTH 101 &amp; 102 that haven't yet been pushed from my brain by subsequently-acquired knowledge about Tivo operation, professional wrestling and other pursuits important to the 21st century male lifestyle. But as a geek, I still have a visceral reaction against rebadging tech projects as art.</div>
<div class="line">I guess my objection is similar to the stupid &quot;I could do that!&quot; trope. At its root, this is obviously not a particularly good criticism. But more specifically, I'm bothered by <em>how</em> I could do that: by starting to fuck around with a bunch of technical doodads, ultimately developing some novel hacked-together thing, then refining it into something that can be somewhat-plausibly billed as a &quot;commentary&quot; on something else.</div>
<div class="line">I realize that directionless experimentation has led to plenty of meaningful art. And I know that divorcing authorial intent from the equation is what I'm supposed to do. But can't I at least be bothered by a complete and utter lack of intent?</div>
<div class="line">I suppose it's also a question of presentation: if I didn't see quite so many of these projects billed as explorations of how we interact with technology, I'd be less dissatisfied with them. Most have nothing to do with our relationship to technology — they're just weird artifacts that take batteries. Now, I <em>like</em> weird, battery-powered artifacts. But I don't like being oversold on their cultural import. To my prejudiced eye this class of work is no more impressive or aesthetically important than the electronic oddities on display in the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akihabara">Akihabaras</a> of the world. It seems like there are far more interesting thoughts to be taken away from Korean- and Chinese-produced USB <a class="reference external" href="http://blog.wired.com/weirdusb/">found art</a> than in Western geeks' stabs at willful weirdness.</div>
<div class="line">But I shouldn't be completely dismissive. <a class="reference external" href="http://www.makezine.com/blog/archive/2006/03/interactive_kinetic_sculpture.html">This piece</a>, by the same local artist who did the above-linked fish thing, seems like it could be pretty good. And I'm officially in favor of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.the-tilt.com/trees.html#videos">cyborg trees</a> (scroll down for an explanatory video). Both of these strike me as employing technology in service of an idea, rather than using ideas to justify the deployment of technology. That's all I'm really asking for.</div>

I wouldn't be so hard on yourself, G.</div>
<div class="line">Call me crazy, wrongheaded, dangerously deranged but... isn't Beck sort of just-okay? Sure, he's put out a lot of pretty good pop songs. But I can't say that any of them have moved me or gotten stuck in my head (at least, not in a good way).

<div class="line">Ayer's Hardware is the greatest store on earth. From the wealth of electrical doodads to the penny candy to the commendably deadly toy guns, it's a winner all the way. I've had two friends work there, re-told <a class="reference external" href="http://www.jeffnye.org">Jeff</a>'s story about Mr. Ayers dying on the breakroom couch dozens of times, and been in the store for post-church candy acquisition on more occasions than I can possibly count. Also, it's where my in-store Santa of choice resided when I was a kid. It's a great store.</div>
<div class="line">It's also probably the best place on earth to go for last-minute Halloween costume preparation. With its help (and a brief stop by Target for thermal underwear), I was able to go from zero to Krang in the space of one afternoon. I think it turned out pretty well:</div>
<div class="line"><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://flickr.com/photos/93467005&#64;N00/282314554/"><img alt="me as krang; photo by yglesias" src="http://static.flickr.com/94/282314554_eae729385c.jpg" /></a></div>
<div class="line">Fewer people knew that Krang was an evil brain from Dimension X (a subdivision of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle universe) than I had expected, but those that did seemed pretty enthusiastic about it. More importantly, at the moment I appear to be occupying the top three spots on Flickr for the tag &quot;<a class="reference external" href="http://flickr.com/photos/tags/krang">krang</a>&quot;, which is extremely great.</div>
<div class="line">But I don't really deserve any of the credit: Emily came up with the idea. Her Cylon costume was highly successful in its own right, featuring hexagonal dog tags, spaceboots and precisely-selected spacetanktops. And, if I can boast a little, it had a pretty great light-up spine (that I took a pretty non-great video of after the batteries had mostly died). Note to future generations of Cylon impersonators: 27 volts is about right for a string of seven Christmas lights. We used 36v, and apparently it got unpleasantly hot.</div>

<div class="line">I visited Emily in Philadelphia last weekend — conveniently enough, she and her neighbors had all decided to throw a party on Saturday. The apartments all adjoin a nice brick courtyard, providing a pretty prime party location. The food was great, the booze was plentiful, and talk eventually turned to the the Flickr API and how to use microcontrollers to train cats to use the toilet (this was not a theoretical conversation). And there was mulled cider. C'mon, admit it: that's pretty good.</div>
<div class="line">Anyway, it was a lot of fun. And as you might imagine, there are pictures. But I wouldn't be doing justice to a party at which I discussed the Flickr API with multiple people if I didn't do <em>something</em> weird with the photoset. So check it out: I've written a handy wrapper function in PHP that lets me quickly generate thumbnail galleries. Even better, they make use of the excellent <a class="reference external" href="http://www.huddletogether.com/projects/lightbox2/">Lightbox2 project</a>. Go ahead — click on one of the thumbnails for web 2.0-y goodness. It works pretty well for me, although to exit picture-viewing mode I seem to have to click above or below the photo — clicking to its right or left seems relatively flakey.</div>
