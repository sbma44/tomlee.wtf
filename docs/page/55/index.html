                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>I just got back from <a class="reference external" href="http://www.dcist.com/archives/2007/01/02/washington_post.php">the Post's blogger summit thingy</a>. How was it? Well, there wasn't any booze. But it was pretty interesting. The Washington Post has plans for you, little blogger.</p>
<p>Among them:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>They've <a class="reference external" href="http://adv.washingtonpost.com/blogroll/2006/11/about_blogroll_1.html">already launched</a> and will be continuing to build upon a hyperlocal AdWords competitor that only shows ads when it can beat the AdWords <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_Per_Mille">CPM</a>. The assembled bloggers seemed most interested in this, despite the fact that it'll likely mean a difference of a fraction of a cent per click. Nobody who was in that room is going to become rich off of this (although you'd never know it from the volume and pugnacity of the questions that it prompted). But it's interesting from the Post's perspective: it's a forward-thinking way of reclaiming ground from Craigslist. That's pretty smart.</li>
<li>More interestingly, they plan to launch a directory of DC blogs. Of course, <a class="reference external" href="http://dcblogs.com/">we've already got a good one</a>. But the Post seems certain to become the canonical index. It'll be good to have this stuff in one high-profile place, and even better to have it exposed to the Post's massive readership. On the whole, it seems certain to be a win for the DC blogosphere.</li>
</ul>
<p>But there are some downsides:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>They intend to rip off the already-much-ripped-off DCist Flickr pool idea. C'est la vie. But credit where due: I believe it was <a class="reference external" href="http://www.goodspeedupdate.com/">Rob</a>'s idea originally, and it was a great one. But they may get more than they're bargaining for: they're a family newspaper — I suspect spam and griefers will be a problem for something as high profile as this. I got the distinct impression that they don't have a full-time staffer available to run this thing.</li>
<li>They didn't seem very receptive to the idea of providing an API. I think that's a shame — directories of this kind ought to be open and accessible. I suppose I'll write some Perl to turn it into an OPML file every day and serve it up somewhere. Still, it would be nice if they embraced the spirit of openness. They'll be offering some RSS feeds, but I don't think that's enough.</li>
<li>Similarly, despite their goal of by-neighborhood categorization, they seemed nervous about precisely geocoding the participating blogs. <a class="reference external" href="http://nikolasrschiller.com/">Nikolas Schiller</a> kept pushing for it, and I joined him, but they claimed to be worried about the privacy implications — and eventually turned the word &quot;geocoding&quot; into a running joke, as if they didn't know what it meant. Now, I do think that Nikolas is a bit map-happy, but he's absolutely right about this. There are pretty simple ways to collect and use precise data without exposing it to dangerous weirdos.</li>
</ul>
<p>But I'm sure that privacy is only part of their concern. Finding someone to write the API and geocoding stuff is probably the bigger stumbling block. They seem like they're building a pretty basic Yahoo-style directory (right down to trying to settle on a fixed taxonomy for participating bloggers to use), and I imagine they don't want to complicate anything. But the API could consist of a handful of simple REST calls, and geocoding is just a Google Maps mashup away (it's a lot easier than it looks). The front page will just be a little fun, flashy stuff thrown on top of their crawled RSS database.</p>
<p>As for their motivation, I think it must primarily be out of the goodness of their hearts — and wanting to be the center of the DC blogosphere. Other than attracting participants to their ad program, I don't see how they're going to monetize it. So call it a good thing for the blogs of DC — but not as good a thing as it could be.</p>
<p>Oh! They're also going to begin geocoding their <a class="reference external" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/rss/index.html">RSS feeds</a> soon. That was probably the most exciting thing I heard all night.</p>

Pretty neat, and somewhat similar to a project that I finished not too long ago for our office's lobby (more on that soon). I wonder how he pulls apart the SIP VoIP stream...</p>
<p>The creator's <a class="reference external" href="http://cell-ular.com/">other project</a> is pretty cool, too — it uses <a class="reference external" href="http://www.processing.org">Processing</a> and cameraphones and image recognition to an interesting effect. I can't figure out how the hell one uses the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.mobot.com/">mobot</a> image recognition service that he refers to, though.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Check out <a class="reference external" href="http://www.megaphone3000.com/">this project</a>, too, from the <a class="reference external" href="http://itp.nyu.edu/show/results.php?sortby=class">same show</a>. With the number of bars and clubs that have prominent video displays, the low cost of the software (and VoIP service) and the ubiquity of cell phones, I really think a fun business could be made out of creating and selling machines that offer this kind of ad-hoc head-to-head gaming. I know I'd enjoy watching a projection of a few people play a game of Bomberman while waiting for the next band set up at a 9:30 show. Maybe the winner gets some money off his tab — it'd be great.</p>

                    <p>Lisa is about to start teaching high school English and is a <a class="reference external" href="http://bellowsbelle.typepad.com/the_bellows_belle/2007/01/teach_this.html">little surprised</a> at what's on the reading list: out with the old, in with the new, broadly speaking. It sounds more familiar to me, I'm afraid. She and I are the same age, but this trend had already hit Arlington County schools when I went through them — and Washington-Lee High School in particular.</p>
<p>I remember reading <em>Alas, Babylon</em> and <em>Cry, The Beloved Country</em> and other non- or neo-classics instead of the canon. And I have to say that I'm a little pissed off about it: I enjoyed those books, but once I got to college I mostly spent my credit-hours on computer science, neuroscience and philosophy. I wasn't able to take a ton of literature classes to fill the holes in my Western education.</p>
<p>The result has been a consistent annoyance. I'm sure that these books work just as well as the classics for teaching the sorts of things high school English students need to learn. <em>Beloved</em>, for example, was not only enjoyable but also uses some of the same narrative tricks as recent internet favorite <em>The Sound and the Fury</em>. But I would be much better equipped to get highbrow jokes, make pretentious bon mots, and complete the New York Times crossword puzzle if we had read the latter instead of the former. Ultimately, that's the real value of selecting one very good book instead of another. Either will suffice for the important stuff, but one will be more useful at cocktail parties.</p>
<p>I do think that teaching kids earnest liberal lessons about other cultures is a worthwhile goal, but I'm not convinced that novels are a very efficient way to do it. I suspect that better movie selection during those days when teacher is hungover could be just as effective. I think that the week in health class when we watched <a class="reference external" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107630/">My Life</a> would have been better spent on <a class="reference external" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075572/">Roots</a>. &quot;How to die with dignity&quot; is a lesson that can probably be delayed until sometime after graduation.</p>
<p>Of course, we did get some classics: I continue to enjoy making starvation and axe-murder jokes based on <em>Crime and Punishment</em> and <em>The Grapes of Wrath</em>. But I kind of had bad luck there, too, in that our prescribed classics tended to be either kind of shmaltzy (O Henry, lots more of the aforementioned Steinbeck) or redundant (we read a lot of Shakespeare, which is pretty much the only type of lit course that I did take again in college — my own fault, I guess) or just kind of beside the point (I'm convinced we only read <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Life-Denisovitch-Signet-Classics-Paperback/dp/0451527097/sr=8-1/qid=1168030727/ref=pd_bbs_1/105-1151806-0209230?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books">this book</a> because it was both Russian and short — a pretty rare combination — although other people insist I just missed the greatness of the novel).</p>
<p>Still, I have to give Arlington County Public Schools' reading list policy credit for one thing: it was pleasantly easy to subvert. Along with friends, I managed to get both <em>Ender's Game</em> and <em>Snow Crash</em> assigned to my classes, and it was awesome. What do <em>you</em> think YT's high-tech skateboard symbolizes?</p>

<p>I do side with Kriston on this one, though. But I think that the real problem here is the limit on ways in which you can get <em>The Sound and the Fury</em>. Assuming that nobody objects to a paternalistic approach to filling the library's shelves (we're all friendly liberals here, right?), this debate is really just a simple utilitarian argument over quality and quantity. How much of a shelf goes to infrequently used but valuable books, and how much to frequently used crap?</p>
<p>I think the way out of this tedious calculation lies in Kriston's closing barb:</p>
<blockquote>
We could just set up YouTube terminals. Dick in a box! Dick in a box for everyone. Let's throw italics around Dick in a Box.</blockquote>
<p>I can't say I remember whether AP style calls for italicizing the titles of YouTube clips, but, as you might expect (and as with all things), I think that &quot;more computers&quot; is roughly the right direction to take. <a class="reference external" href="http://www.forrester.com/ER/Press/Release/0,1769,470,FF.html">On-demand-printing</a> (or downloading to e-book reader) is coming — really, it ought to be in county libraries as rich as Fairfax's right now. But there's a problem.</p>
<p>In a saner world, the copyright on <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> (published 1929) would expire <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonny_Bono_Copyright_Term_Extension_Act">before 2032</a>. The work could be distributed freely to whomever wanted it, instead of paying for the drunken Tijuana exploits of William &quot;Wet Willie&quot; Faulkner VI (I assume). Save the shelves for the modern stuff and its copyright-induced scarcity.</p>
<p>At this point I imagine some will object and start talking about how books smell. But many library users are already used to having to deal with more easily-compressed forms of media than the beloved hardcover — there's microfiche for periodicals and electronic databases for scientific journals, for example. It's a tradeoff that has and will continue to be worth making.</p>
<p>Digital technology now allows us to sidestep Fairfax's dilemma entirely. And it's a good thing, too: libraries have limitations that our technology does not. In fact, the only thing libraries really have going for them is that tradition allows them to exist outside the screwed-up intellectual property regime that governs the rest of our society. The best solution here isn't to fret over patching up the library, it's to set loose the internet. You're reading this online, for god's sake. Consider just how quaint the idea of rationing information has become.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Julian <a class="reference external" href="http://juliansanchez.com/notes/archives/2007/01/must_we_burn_faulkner.php">says the same thing</a>, only more intelligently (and earlier). Also, he links to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.usask.ca/english/faulkner/main/index.html">an online edition</a> of <em>TS&amp;TF</em>. Huh — I thought copyright was the author's death + 70 years. Is it because the site is Canadian that this is possible?</p>

In short, he thinks insecure software players will continue to exist, and will be used by crackers to extract and distribute volume keys, which are the keys specific to different titles, and which can't be revoked by the central AACS authority. You'll have to acquire a volume key before ripping a DVD and uploading it to the Bittorrent networks, but at just a few KB of (now easily-obtained) data, that shouldn't pose a significant barrier to pirates' efforts. And of course, once one unprotected copy is on the net, the jig is up...</p>

                    <p>I'm sorry, but <a class="reference external" href="http://www.boingboing.net/2007/01/03/cheap_aaa_batteries_.html">this</a> is pretty stupid. BoingBoing and Gizmodo think that you can harvest cheap AAA batteries from 9V batteries (the kind with the snaps on top). If you crack open a 9V you'll find six 1.5V cylinders inside, and the 9V battery sells for a much lower price than six AAAs do at retail.</p>
<p>Here are <a class="reference external" href="http://www.batterycountry.com/ShopSite/alkaline-batteries.html">some battery capacities</a>. Let's use the Energizer Industrial Alkaline brand. Their 9Vs have a capacity of 625 milliamp-hours. Their AAAs have a capacity of 1250 milliamp-hours. Watts = volts x amps....</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">(1.25 amps) x (1.5 volts) x (6 AAA batteries) = 11.25 watts in 6 AAA batteries</div>
<div class="line">(0.625 amps) x (9 volts) x (1 9V battery) = 5.625 watts in one 9V battery</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Obviously a 9V and six AAAs aren't actually interchangeable. You can take apart a 9V and get six cylinders with the same voltage as AAA batteries, but nowhere near the same capacity.</p>
<p>A little more arithmetic and you realize that you're getting 6.211 watts per dollar from the AAAs, and 4.199 watts per dollar from the 9V batteries (based on the bulk prices). So this only makes sense for applications where you don't actually care about how much use you'll get out of the battery. For remote controls that you plan to lose before changing the batteries, it might be a good idea (assuming you're ready to carefully crack open a battery). Otherwise, it's not.</p>
<p>The moral: math continues to be useful, and secret battery-industry conspiracies (and free lunches in general) continue to be mostly nonexistent.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>One nice thing about last week's vacation from the plugged-in lifestyle was that there was a bunch of interesting tech news waiting for me upon my return. The most exciting bits:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://vixy.net/flv_converter">An open-source FLV transcoder</a>. This may be old news — it was posted to the <a class="reference external" href="http://del.icio.us/echoditto">echoditto del.icio.us feed</a> a little while ago. But it's still pretty exciting to me. Using it, an enterprising geek could grab content from YouTube (or any other Flash video source) and programmatically remix it however they want. Creating an automatic video montage based on a particular tag might be a fun project.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.xbox-scene.com/xbox1data/sep/EEyZyFuFZuIAxHIyTS.php">The Xbox 360 may have been cracked</a>. There have already been exploits related to the DVD drive's firmware that allowed burned DVD-Rs to be played, but that only facilitated piracy. Running alternate operating systems or homebrew games remained impossible. But now someone is claiming to have accomplished this feat.
The presumed route of ingress? The shaders on a particular game. Shaders are small executable subprograms that are run extremely quickly by graphics hardware — they're not part of the game's main executable. Instead, they're responsible for things like drawing the surface of water, or making hair look more realistic. They also may be less protected on the 360 than the main executable — a demo disc that was distributed to stores over the internet contained shaders that weren't cryptographically protected and that could be modified and reburned to the disc. Once hackers realized this, the search was on to find exploits that let software authors get at the main system memory and proceed to bend the system to their will.
Now someone has shown some sample video at a conference implying that they've succeeded (although the equipment they used implied that there may be a hardware aspect to the crack as well). Is this a real exploit or just a hoax? It's hard to say — when the route of attack is through a graphics-related subsystem, changing what's on the screen doesn't necessarily indicate that you've fully compromised the system in a useful way. But this is all pretty encouraging.</li>
<li>Most interestingly, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.engadget.com/2006/12/27/aacs-drm-cracked-by-backuphddvd-tool/">AACS may have been cracked</a>, too. It's a little early to know for sure, but it looks like the copy protection on the new HD-DVD format may have suffered its first setback. A user calling himself muslix64 claims to have found a way to get the title keys for discs by extracting them from the PowerDVD software.
Lots of folks are running around forums saying that this isn't a crack — and it's true, muslix64 didn't find a way to beat the AES encryption. But that's just semantics; if his claims are accurate, he's found a way to get the keys to it, which is the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decss">same thing</a> that happened to the thoroughly-broken Content Scrambling System of the DVD format (flaws related to its implementation of the cryptography system were also found later, but only added insult to injury — the damage was done).
AACS is better-designed than CSS, though, in that it allows for key revocation. Here's my understanding of how it works, in a nutshell: each disc's data content is encrypted with a title key that's unique to that disc. Along with the data, the title key is present on the disc — but it's also encrypted. Because it's short, a bunch of different copies of this encrypted title key can be placed on the disc, each encrypted with a different <em>player key</em>. If your company wants to manufacture an HD-DVD player (hardware or software), you must apply for and receive a player key from <a class="reference external" href="http://www.thelookandsoundofperfect.com/">the HD-DVD format's governing body</a>. Your player will use this key to get at the title key, which is in turn used to to unlock the content on the disc. It's sort of like those little boxes that realtors keeps on the doorknobs of houses that are for sale: if you want to look at the house, you enter a combination and get its key out. Each realtor could get a unique combination, but each property only needs one key. I may be drastically wrong about this analogy — I don't know that much about how realtors operate. But this is how HD-DVD does.
The advantage of this system is that if one player is compromised, the format's protection isn't totally boned. Instead, the HD-DVD consortium identifies the player and stops putting the version of the title key encrypted with that player's key on all discs that are pressed in the future. So if a player is compromised, every disc created prior to that date can be cracked, but all the ones produced in the future won't be. And the player manufacturer will have to get a new key (assuming the HD-DVD consortium is willing to give them another one).
Another thing to realize: you own your computer's RAM, and with the right software you can get at any of its contents. So when you run a program that plays an HD-DVD successfully, it means that somewhere in your system is that player's key, and, during the program's run, the disc's unencrypted title key. There are various ways of obscuring these keys and getting them out of memory as quickly as possible, but with enough [STRIKEOUT:monkeys] nerds and [STRIKEOUT:typewriters] debuggers, you'll eventually find it.
That seems to be what's happened. With the DVD format it was Xing's player that leaked its key — and under the DVD protection scheme there was no way to revoke the key. With HD-DVD it appears to be the PowerDVD program that's been compromised, and its key can and probably will be revoked. So this crack probably won't work with discs released in the future.
But it's also likely that more software players will have their keys stolen. The only way to avoid that is to stop issuing keys to software players, or to force everyone to use a <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_computing">trusted computing</a> hardware platform, which would prevent users from indiscriminately accessing their systems' memory (this is why geeks hate &amp; fear the idea of a TC initiative).
The real fun will happen when a hardware player's key is leaked and revoked (it's considerably harder to get at hardware keys, but with the right equipment and expertise it can usually be done). Everyone who's bought the player in question will be left with a box that can't play any new movies. Odds are that consumers won't be very pleased with this development. If I had to put money on a single event decisively turning the public against DRM, I'd put it on this.</li>

<p>And thanks to those of you that stopped by last night. I'm going to go ahead and call the whole thing a big success. We suspect that our bathroom may have been host to both drug use and, uh, romance. If that's not the mark of a good party, I don't know what is.</p>
<p>I've spent today hungover &amp; whining, but things are looking up — it may almost be time to venture out and get some food. While I steel myself for that, here are the non-terrible photos that I found on my camera this morning. I'm particularly fond of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/341374327/in/set-72157594452559819/">this shot</a> of Michael and Emily, and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/341381104/in/set-72157594452559819/">this one</a> of Spencer, who receives Party MVP status for his superlative karaoke performance (narrowly edging out Kriston, who ably assumed the mantle of DJ-dom when called to duty).</p>
<p><strong>OH YEAH:</strong> There was also some <a class="reference external" href="http://flickr.com/photos/mcdermott/340959816/in/set-72157594451931245/">knife fighting</a>. Like I said, it was a good party.</p>

                    <p>Hi everybody. Well, the New Year's party is only a few hours away, and vacation is winding down. Going into this time off I had grand, bloggy plans, nearly all of which went completely ignored and unfulfilled. Among my intended projects:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Fixing my <a class="reference external" href="/2006/12/19/do-me-a-favor/">full-text RSS thingamajig</a>. I ended up not touching a line of code. I'll get to it eventually.</li>
<li>Building an extension cord that could toggle itself on and off based on input from my Arduino (the original plan was to have some Christmas lights blink a yule-appropriate message in Morse Code). I put some time into this one, but although I managed not to electrocute myself or blow any circuit breakers (to my astonishment/disappointment), I appear not to understand how transistors work very well. The relay assembly seems to work pretty well, and the Morse Code program blinks the Arduino's pin 13 LED reliably, but the transistor doesn't seem to do anything despite the input to its base. Anyone who's even slightly competent at electronics is hereby begged to have a quick look at the following diagram. I know I'm missing a protection diode across the relay coil, but I kind of doubt that's the source of the problem. Maybe, though! I'm just piecing this stuff together from the internet and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Practical-Electronics-Inventors-Paul-Scherz/dp/0070580782/sr=8-2/qid=1167601484/ref=pd_bbs_2/105-1151806-0209230?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books">this book</a>, and consequently I'm probably making some obvious mistakes.

<strong>UPDATE:</strong> Thanks to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/11328208&#64;N00/">anachrocomputer</a>, who figured out the problem for me in the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/44137303&#64;N00/340044058">comments</a> on the photo. I'd accidentally made an <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emitter_follower">emitter follower</a> (aka common collector) circuit, which resulted in the transistor only allowing through as much voltage as was applied to its base — in this case, the Arduino's ~5 volts. The result was that the relay (which requires 12V) wouldn't fire. Whoops!</li>
<li>My Javascript-powered automatic illustration doohickey: untouched!</li>
<li>My Tetris project: well, finished before leaving work, actually. But the demonstration video: unproduced!</li>
<li>And I'm pretty sure I've forgotten about a couple of other things I meant to do. Oh well. They probably weren't that great, anyway.</li>
</ul>
<p>I did accomplish <a class="reference external" href="http://www.movering.com/node/303">one</a> or <a class="reference external" href="http://www.dcist.com/archives/photos/">two</a> small things, but mostly I just sat around, played with the Wii and worked to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.metroid.com/prime2/main.htm">liberate Aether from the dreaded Ing</a> (and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.unfogged.com/archives/week_2006_12_24.html#006015">hanging out with internet weirdos</a>, of course). It's been a pretty unproductive break. But after a year without a real vacation, I think that's exactly what I needed.</p>

<p>I suppose that this verbal use of &quot;gift&quot; isn't technically incorrect — that's what the internet tells me, anyway. But it still seems really, really ugly to me. I've given up on the rest of the American-speaking world, but I expect more from my turtleneck-wearing yuppie compatriots in Cupertino. They really ought to task some more people with editing. So to speak.</p>
<p>Other things! The Wii: pretty great, although potentially bad for my joints. Emily: currently stuck in Philadelphia. Myself: off to make half-hearted efforts at physical fitness. More on all of these later.</p>

I was hoping to sit on the news, taking my time to calmly and objectively evaluate how this triumph affects Sommer's place in history. I hate to be forced to make a decision prematurely, but right now I'd say she's coming in somewhere between the saints who died of puncture wounds and the ones whose deaths were related to being cooked and/or eaten.

<div class="line">Now, the question: what games to get? I'm leaning toward Rayman &amp; Zelda, for the sake of mini-games and single player obsession, respectively. But I could be talked out of it if anyone has a particularly strong case to make on behalf of Excite Truck (or anything else).</div>

<p>Does this look like a crushingly depressing Christmas Eve tableau? The sort of sight that Charles Bukowski might have seen before erupting in volcanic torrents of vomited eggnog? I submit to you that it is not. And that's a problem.</p>
<p>I suppose I had a good enough time hanging out with Matt and Spencer. But to be honest, we were all looking forward to a repeat of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.zunta.org/blog/archives/2006/01/02/personal_failur/">last year</a>: a bar with few people, plenty of despair and &quot;Fairytale Of New York&quot; on a nonstop loop.</p>
<p>But instead there were no Pogues albums on the jukebox, there were lots of people, and I ended up having a pretty good time. Rats.</p>

                    <p>I'm not sure what else I can do. I've been to the suburbs Sunday after Sunday — but there have been no Wiis. The last two days I've gotten up early and taken the Metro to Pentagon City before work, visiting the Best Buy within minutes of its opening — no Wiis. My [STRIKEOUT:agents] friends have generously scoured <a class="reference external" href="http://urbancoyote.blogspot.com">Texas</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cruelsommer.blogspot.com">Arizona</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.movering.com">London</a> on my behalf, like Nintendo Nazgul — no Wiis.</p>
<p>Tomorrow everyone will be off work, and it'll be too late. I may make the trek to Best Buy one more time, but I expect there'll be throngs waiting with me. My advantage will be gone, and my cause lost.</p>
<p>I suppose there's always the week after Christmas. But in the meantime I'm left seething at the thought of those who have successfully gotten their hands on the console. Have they proven their devotion? Did they deserve it more than me!? No, goddammit! I guess this is how conservatives feel about affirmative action.</p>

<p>It's a fascinating thesis. But what's the Marxist take on replica Rolexes as Christmas gifts?</p>
<p>I really, <em>really</em> don't understand why Indymedia exists. If they has some sort of editorial staff that cultivated, screened and ran leftist essays and reporting, that'd be one thing. But they seem to just take random crap from anybody and throw it up on the site — I recall one recent post from Indymedia DC accusing Google of having nothing to do with the internet (they're actually a narcotics cartel, see...) and another that consisted solely of a rambling apology to the author's AA sponsor. Hilariously, Wikipedia <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indymedia#Structure">cites</a> the DC chapter as one of the more regimented within the organization. I keep my RSS subscription because the local media doesn't bother to provide notice of upcoming protests, which, given warning, are frequently an avoidable inconvenience. But other than that, DC Indymedia seems hilariously useless.</p>
<p>I'm left to conclude that the only other function they serve is to lower the barriers that prevent dopes from publishing things on the internet. Which, if you haven't noticed, aren't particularly high to begin with. I can't believe that governments bother to seize these guys' servers.</p>

                    <p>A <a class="reference external" href="http://diplodocus.wordpress.com/2006/12/19/there-will-be-a-quiz/">meme</a>! Awesome. I never get these. Here we go, five things that I think most people don't know about me (but that I don't mind telling them):</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><strong>I can juggle.</strong> I learned how during summer camp and eventually got pretty decent at it — for about a week I could do passing with clubs, if given a sufficiently patient partner. I've also juggled torches in a proof-of-concept sort of way (we weren't allowed to actually light them). But I'm self-aware enough to realize that juggling is not only a useless and highly dorky skill, but also one that it's impolite and annoying to force on an unsuspecting world. So I try to keep it under wraps. For a while I would use juggling as a rough sobriety test, but eventually I got too good at doing it while under the influence. Now I only ever really break it out when I need a flashy way to accidentally damage fruit. But I do credit it with rescuing me from being a completely uncoordinated disaster at all sports; now I'm a mere embarrassment. Thanks, juggling!</li>
<li><strong>I didn't grow up with cable TV.</strong> This isn't much of a secret, but people tend to forget it in conversation. All of your gak-colored Nickelodeon memories are lost on me. <em>Hey Dude</em>, <em>You Can't Do That On Television</em>, <em>Ren &amp; Stimpy</em> — these mean almost nothing in my mind. When they come up I'll smile and nod, then try to steer the conversation toward <em>Family Double Dare</em>, <em>Transformers</em> and other over-the-air shows that are enjoying an irritating ironic renaissance.</li>
<li><strong>I'm not very good at math.</strong> People assume that I'm a math whiz because I'm interested in science, I program computers and I know what a <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/THAC0">THAC0</a> is. I suppose I'm decent at certain simple kinds of math, if only because I get occasional practice at them — I'll sometimes have to bust out some algebra to complete an algorithm I'm writing, and whenever I get in the mood to write something graphically flashy I'll enjoy doing the geometry that comes with it. But I've never been very good at calculus, and although I've encountered some slightly more advanced math during college, I've always forgotten it as quickly as possible. My eyes inevitably glaze over when I get to the formulae in the various pop science books that I otherwise enjoy reading. Personally, I blame all of this on my high school calculus teacher, who didn't manage to convey what the &quot;dx&quot; in all those equations was supposed to mean until about a week before the AP test. Looking back, I'm pretty sure she was busy having a lesbian awakening over the course of that year, so I guess I can understand her failure to impart these important concepts. Still, it was an underwhelming period of instruction, particularly when compared to my geometry class. That dude had a lazy eye — it was impossible to tell whether he was looking at you, which, as a teaching method, I can't recommend highly enough. It really kept me on my toes.</li>
<li><strong>I used to be kinda chubby.</strong> Not ridiculously so, but at my peak I was about 35 or 40 pounds heavier than I am now. I was a bulky enough kid that I was half-heartedly recruited by my high school's football coach to be on our atrociously bad and understaffed team (I had enough sense to say no, thankfully). My sophomore year of college I decided I'd had enough soda and Taco Bell to show my junkfood-eschewing parents who was boss, and got my act together.</li>
<li><strong>I'm not an atheist.</strong> I was raised in a protestant family and went to church and Sunday School every week. I hated it. I wouldn't say I believe in God — I figure I'll have some time to work it out when I'm on my deathbed — but I do know that I find people like PZ Me/yers and Richard Dawkins to be insulting, insufferable, and highly deserving of having their lunch money extracted from them by force. I don't know precisely what I believe, but I definitely don't believe in condescending arrogance. Not in other people, anyway.</li>
</ol>
<p>Alright, there it is. This meme seems to have spread strangely quickly — it's made it to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.scripting.com/2006/12/19.html#fiveThingsYouDidntKnowAboutMe">Dave Winer's blog</a>, and <a class="reference external" href="http://cyrusfarivar.com/blog/?p=1204">Cyrus</a> has already been tagged, too. Could it be that bloggers like talking about themselves? Hmm.</p>
<p>I'm tempted to try to slow the spread of the contagion by just naming one or two people... Aw, to hell with it. I'll tag <a class="reference external" href="http://www.jeffnye.org">Jeff</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://fillygrrrl.blogspot.com/">Caralyn</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://tinymovements.blogspot.com/">Genevieve</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.movering.com">Emily</a>, who should all feel free to ignore this if they're not in the mood for it.</p>

                    <p>This time <a class="reference external" href="http://dceiver.blogspot.com/2006/12/our-top-fifty-reactions-to-pitchforks.html">has come</a> to complain about <a class="reference external" href="http://pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/40007/Staff_List_Top_50_Albums_of_2006">Pitchfork's year end list</a>. Allow me to join the terrifying din. Like <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ryanavent.com/blog/?p=195">Ryan</a>, I've never heard of The Knife. In fact, there's a ton of stuff on the list that I haven't listened to. I suppose I probably should, although the rankings of the stuff I recognize do not inspire confidence (nor does the seeming overrepresentation of hiphop, electronica and hard rock — three genres that I only enjoy in intermittent doses, and almost never when recommended by Pitchfork).</p>
<p>We don't have the perspective to make a final judgment, but right now it seems like 2006 was kind of a thin year when compared to <a class="reference external" href="http://djmonstermo.blogspot.com/2005/12/pitchfork-top-50-albums-of-2005.html">the</a> <a class="reference external" href="http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/38230/Staff_List_Top_50_Albums_of_2004/page_1">last</a> <a class="reference external" href="http://old-site.pitchforkmedia.com/top/2003/index.shtml">three</a>. They say that the best music is produced when Republicans are in charge, so maybe the shifting national mood resulted in fewer great albums. Personally, I prefer to blame Canada: they've been propping up our indie rock economy for years, but this year were suddenly and strangely absent. I guess this is what it's going to be like when China stops floating the national debt. Here's hoping that our Northern neighbors have got something big planned for 2007.</p>
<p>Anyway, even putting aside all of my ignorance, ambivalence and vague hostility toward the p-fork list, there are a few things that I was surprised not to see show up there. Here are some albums that I thought ought to have been present, and which Amazon assures me were released in 2006:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><strong>Mates of State – Bring It Back</strong>
I don't expect anyone to condone my shameless lust for pop. But for those who share the same affliction, I can't recommend this album highly enough.</li>
<li><strong>Figurines – Skeleton</strong>
Yeah, it's a little too Modest-Mousey to get complete credit for originality. Still, it's varied but without any clunkers, and it holds up well to repeated listens. &quot;Silver Ponds&quot; and &quot;Other Plans&quot; are going to be in my playlists for a long time to come.</li>
<li><strong>Karmella's Game – The Art Of Distraction</strong>
This record is so catchy as to ultimately be exhausting, but it'd be hard to overstate KG's underdog appeal. &quot;Safely Negative&quot; is especially good, I think. I didn't actually expect Pitchfork to notice this record, of course, but I wish they had anyway.</li>
<li><strong>Gnarls Barkley – St. Elsewhere</strong>
Is it because <em>Crazy</em> was leaked in 2005? Because the rest of the album is mostly solid but non-mind-blowing? Or is it because half of all commercials in 2006 used it as their score? Whatever the reason, I'm confused by Pitchfork's refusal to acknowledge the album that contained the biggest song of 2006. They <a class="reference external" href="http://old-site.pitchforkmedia.com/top/2003/index3.shtml">extended the courtesy to Outkast</a>, didn't they?</li>
<li><strong>Malajube – Tromp L'oeil</strong>
I'm probably just including it because it's the best thing I've heard recently, and because I miss Canada. I've had a hard time finding albums to love in the second half of 2006.</li>
<li><strong>I'm From Barcelona – Let Me Introduce My Friends</strong></li>
<li><strong>Beirut – Gulag Orkestar</strong>
I've got a feeling that this album trades on traditions that it has no right to claim, but I wouldn't really know and I'm certainly not qualified to be the one bringing that criticism to bear. So it just ends up making me feel vaguely uneasy about the whole project. Pretty good tunes, though.</li>
<li><strong>Rainer Maria – Catastrophe Keeps Us Together</strong>
Throw 'em a bone, guys.</li>
<li><strong>Annuals – Be He Me</strong>
I'm not sure where this ought to be ranked — to be honest, I've got to listen to it some more. But &quot;Brother&quot; alone puts it on my list... somewhere.</li>
</ol>
<p>Also: no <em>Yeah Yeah Yeahs</em>? I started listening to it late, so I don't know how I'd rank it, but it seems awfully good. Better than the <em>Band of Horses</em> album, at least.</p>
<p>Things on the list that I recognized and have listened to, but don't think should be there:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Joanna Newsom – Ys</strong>
If you're only working with five songs, you'd better make sure you're doing so for a reason. I'm not convinced that Ms. Newsom manages this: I thought that the first half of this record meandered unforgivably before finally getting a hold of itself. I can't help but wonder how much of the acclaim this album has received is due to its novelty. Thanks to my mom I've probably heard somewhat more harp music than is normal for my demographic. <em>Ys</em> doesn't stand out from rest of it as much as some reviewers seem to think it does.</li>
<li><strong>Sunset Rubdown – Shut Up I Am Dreaming</strong>
I love Wolf Parade. <em>Apologies To The Queen Mary</em> is one of my favorite CDs, and their show at the Black Cat was probably the best concert I saw in 2006. But c'mon Pitchfork — despite your assurances to the contrary, this is not a particularly compelling side project. It's more Bell Orchestre than Postal Service: pleasant enough, but completely forgettable.</li>
<li><strong>Phoenix – It's Never Been Like That</strong>
This album felt thin to me in the same way that the recent French Kicks and Pony Up albums did. It's not the songwriting — there's just a certain oomph that was lacking from the album performances. Someone call Timbaland.</li>
<li><strong>Pipettes – We Are The Pipettes</strong>
Alright — maybe I'd leave it on. I don't know. &quot;Pull Shapes&quot; is one of the best songs of the year, and if there was any justice the track would currently be in use to sell us soda and cellphones and automobiles. But after the next one or two really good tracks the songs' quality starts to decline quickly. I'm always enthusiastic about this album when I start playing it, but I'm also always sick of it by the time it's over. The fact that a gimmick, a couple of great songs and bunch of filler can put you in the company of the year's forty-nine other best releases says something about 2006's crop of music, I think.</li>
</ul>

<div class="line">I was wondering when this was going to happen: <a class="reference external" href="http://edition.cnn.com/2006/SHOWBIZ/12/18/perez.hilton.ap/index.html">Perez Hilton is getting sued by the photographers whose photos he's been using</a>. I'm a as sympathetic an audience as Mr. Hilton could possibly hope for: I'm generally pretty hostile toward copyright litigation and I consider demeaning celebrities to be the lord's work. But even so, this seems extremely clear-cut to me: Perez is fucked; and if he genuinely thinks what he's been doing counts as fair use, then he's an idiot, too.</div>
<div class="line">I'm no lawyer, but Perez's inclusion of a photo in one of his posts doesn't strike me as a transformative act, and it seems entirely plausible to me that he's undercutting X17's ability to sell their work. I'm not allowed to steal content from The Onion, append my own witticisms and claim protection as satire. The fact that Perez is doing something funny with these photos does not automatically mean it falls under the fair use doctrine — besides, fair use is weak ground to stand on these days even when it's actually applicable.</div>
<div class="line">So yeah: he's fucked.</div>
