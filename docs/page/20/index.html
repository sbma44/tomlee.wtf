                    <p>Emily and I both read and enjoyed <em>World War Z</em> at the beach. Emily enjoyed it enough to ask that <em>The Zombie Survival Guide</em> be included among her birthday loot, and it was probably the spirit of that book that led us to discuss the technical specifics of vampire abatement strategies.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, no consensus could be reached, so it falls to you, internet, to weigh in on the feasibility of killing a vampire by driving one of the following objects through its heart:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Painted wood (latex/oil/lacquer (e.g. a pool cue))</li>
<li>Particle board</li>
<li>Frozen sawdust and water (<a class="reference external" href="http://dsc.discovery.com/fansites/mythbusters/articles/what-is-pykrete.html">see also</a>)</li>
<li>A cone of tightly-wrapped paper</li>
</ol>
<p>Posit that sufficient force is available to overcome problems related to each material's sharpness — we are killing these vampires in a laboratory setting, and for the sake of this argument can safely dismiss practical concerns.</p>
<p>Emily felt strongly that the wood's semantic status was the primary factor at work, leaving her convinced that option one was the only viable method of disposing of the undead. I disagree completely: I think there must be a chemical mechanism at work, which leads me to expect that methods two and three would unquestionably work, and that method four stands a good chance as well. But I have grave concerns about the use of laminated wood, and frankly am surprised that more vampire fiction doesn't make use of actually-that-stake-was-painted-now-I'm-going-to-bite-you-(SURPRISE!) trope that it makes possible.</p>
<p>What say you, internet? Remember to show your work.</p>

                    <p>I'm back from the beach, and already rapidly spending down the sleep surplus I accrued there. It's a little bit strange being back. I find it comforting to have a plan on the horizon — something out of the usual routine to look forward to. There are plenty of events looming, but aside from Emily's birthday none of them yet have definite dates attached. I crave structure! Otherwise it's too easy for summer to start looking like an air-conditioned march through sunshine and into autumn.</p>
<p>It is nice being back, though, and I'm itching to start work on a few non-Artomatic projects. First, though, I've got to make sure things are working properly at AoM — thanks to Victor my piece was saved from malfunction on opening night, but I haven't yet had a post-opening chance to get down there and confirm that everything's working the way it ought to be (I tried to last night, but had forgotten that Artomatic is closed on Mondays and Tuesdays).</p>
<p>But here, the nominal reason for the post: my sister Beth (whose birthday is today!) sent along <a class="reference external" href="http://www.rice.edu/virtualtours/cityofhouston/tourfiles/flash/index.html">this link</a>, and it's worth a look. It's one of those full-browser 360° panoramic photo dealies, in this case showing off Houstonian attractions that might be of interest to Rice students. Of particular interest are the scenes linked to by the thumbnail of the clown face, and the one two spaces to its right. The first shows off the Orange Show, the bizarre visionary art compound created by an eccentric former orange arbitrageur and his commitment to largely incorrect nutrition education. The second is the Beer Can House, a somewhat less deranged but no less impressive work in which a man fashioned thousands (millions?) of beer cans into artistic armor for his home. Both are managed by the organization that Beth works for and are worth a visit if you find yourself in Houston and temporarily unable to spend the time eating more tacos.</p>

                    <p>I've accidentally run current backward through some delicate electronics, gone through a staggering number of voltage regulators and flat-out melted a solenoid, but my Artomatic project seems to be working! There is, of course, still a chance that some hardware aspect of the thing will fail. Or that there's a hidden software bug that will prevent it from rebooting on schedule. Or that I'll screw something up when I try to move the log files to a nonvolatile disk location. But for now I'm feeling pretty good about it! If you're by the Navy Yard Metro in the next month, you should drop by, see some art and ring some bells.</p>
<p>The Artomatic website makes it unfortunately difficult to find when the damn event will actually be open. But the info can be found in <a class="reference external" href="http://artomatic.org/node/4976">this press release</a>. The key details:</p>
<blockquote>

<div class="line">Wednesdays and Thursdays, 5 p.m. â€“ 10 p.m.</div>

<div class="line">Sundays, 12 noon â€“ 10 p.m.</div>

<p>You can find a map of the location <a class="reference external" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=CSWJHjvshw4KFdc0UQIdn_do-yFJ05RY2kIyxA&amp;q=artomatic&amp;sll=38.881137,-77.0065&amp;sspn=0.011075,0.023797&amp;gl=us&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ei=bEIUStDsEJ-wiwOsxuT_Aw&amp;cd=3&amp;cid=38876394,-77006946,13824474862365011346&amp;li=lmd&amp;ll=38.878272,-77.00695&amp;spn=0.011075,0.023797&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=A">here</a> — Artomatic is in the same building as the Navy Yard Metro entrance that's closest to the ballpark. My piece is on the fourth floor.</p>
<p><strong>OH YEAH:</strong> For those interested, the project's software is <a class="reference external" href="http://github.com/sbma44/artomatic/tree/master">all on GitHub</a>. If you're wandering in from Google in an effort to figure out how to get Python working on the Fonera with serial and network capabilities, this would be a good place to start.</p>

<p>Based on only my sketchy verbal instructions, my dad whipped two of these up in astoundingly little time as I watched dumbly. He also fed me dinner! It was an impressive performance all around, and I'm very grateful. This thing's about 3' tall, and it's what my finished piece will sit upon for display. It'll be draped in cloth, though, so this is hopefully the last time you'll see it.</p>
<p>In less positive news:</p>
<p><img alt="stolen wheel" class="center" src="/static/2009/05/11/stolen_wheel-20090511-103517.png" /></p>
<p>Upon getting back to the Metro last night I found my rear wheel had been stolen. My current run of bad bike-luck is now impressively long (for those keeping score, the last month has gone flat, flat, flat, flat, wheel, flat, brake cable, shifter cable, trued replacement wheel, stolen other wheel). I suppose I can't complain too much — this Jamis served me very well and with very few problems for the past 3.5 years (ever since my <a class="reference external" href="http://www.zunta.org/blog/archives/2005/02/16/loot/">lovely last bike</a> was <a class="reference external" href="http://www.zunta.org/blog/archives/2005/10/09/post_2/">stolen</a> from out in front of Logan Hardware). Karmically, I'm doing okay.</p>
<p>But this is still infuriating. The return on a stolen bike wheel is miniscule — the person who took this probably got less than 5% of the retail cost of the components that I'll now have to rebuy. Worse, I know it's my fault for being rushed and parking it at a Metro and forgetting my cable. And, well, it just sucks. I try to take these things in stride, but it takes me a couple of days to let go of the anger that being victimized provokes. Last night's dreams featured some pretty elaborate bicycle-themed revenge fantasies.</p>

                    <p>My <a class="reference external" href="/2009/05/05/artomatic-update-python-on-the-fonera/">DD-WRT adventures</a> have come to an end. I spent a long time finding the perfect firmware, cramming Python into it, massaging libraries and... found an immovable roadblock.</p>
<p>Here's the thing: in DD-WRT the serial port — which I intend to use for communication between the Arduino and Fonera — is connected to the Linux console. This makes sense: that port is there as an interface of last resort, but it'w only useful if it's actually connected to something like the shell. Unfortunately, a side effect of this is that all incoming communication triggers system commands — regardless of whether it's from an administrator who's just accidentally screwed up his ethernet port or from a microcontroller trying to politely say hello. Worse, the console hogs the serial port, preventing my Python script from reading from it at all.</p>
<p>This linkage is established when the kernel is invoked. That's not an easy thing to change without recompiling DD-WRT. It <a class="reference external" href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=28104&amp;highlight=stty">can be undone at runtime</a> using a program called setconsole, but that program isn't compiled into the DD-WRT firmware I have — I'd have to recompile to get it. And if I'm going to recompile things, why not just use <a class="reference external" href="http://www.openwrt.org">OpenWRT</a>? It's smaller, easier to build and more customizable. And while DD-WRT and its community is undoubtedly better for most people trying to simply turn their routers into better routers, OWRT's got more people ready to discuss the esoteric router territory where I've found myself. The order of magnitude difference in the projects' respective IRC channel populations is proof enough of that. Sure, in OWRT exotic network configurations may require a bit more wading through documentation and conf files (as opposed to DD-WRT's pleasantly powerful web interface). But that's a small price to pay if the goddamn thing actually <em>works</em>.</p>
<p>So last night I successfully <a class="reference external" href="http://kamikaze.openwrt.org/docs/openwrt.html#x1-390002">built</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://wiki.cuwin.net/index.php?title=Flashing_the_La_Fonera_with_OpenWRT">installed</a> OpenWRT. I had to do it in a <a class="reference external" href="http://virtualbox.wordpress.com/images/">VirtualBox Ubuntu image</a> — building OWRT on OS X is <a class="reference external" href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=318">possible</a> but a bit of a pain. Other than that, it went great. I haven't yet put the install through its python-using paces — I found I'd accidentally left a few packages out on my first pass, so after establishing that SSH worked I set it to recompile and went to bed — but every software component I need (python-mini, setconsole, pyserial, stty, etc.) was right there in the menuconfig build system. Clearly <em>somebody</em> has gotten these things to work in the past — tonight I hope to be next one to accomplish that feat.</p>

                    <p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Scratch that. I've hit a roadblock related to serial communication in DD-WRT. If you're only interested in using Python for socket communication and simple stuff, the below text is still useful. But I've concluded that if you want serial, DD-WRT is not the way to go. I've moved on to OpenWRT — you can see the first step in this process <a class="reference external" href="/2009/05/11/giving-up-on-dd-wrt/">here</a>.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>You might remember that I've done a <a class="reference external" href="/2008/03/26/dorkbot-dc-arduino-meet-fonera/">bunch of work</a> on integrating the Fonera and the Arduino. It's a handy setup for microcontroller hobbyists: a reflashed router provides a wireless network interface that's much cheaper than the purpose-built alternatives available for the Arduino, and one which, by virtue of its Linux firmware, is also considerably more powerful. The downsides are its size and power requirements, but for most applications those aren't big concerns.</p>
<p>Last time around I just ran a cron job on the router that periodically fetched data from a web server and shoved it to the Arduino using the <a class="reference external" href="http://busybox.net">busybox</a>-based command line tools that come with the DD-WRT firmware (wget, bash, stty). For my next project, those tools aren't going to cut it. I need two way communication between the Arduino and the Fonera, and I need less latency and more flexibility than those command line tools can offer. I need a proper scripting language.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, things are a bit cramped on the Fonera. There's an <em>apt-get</em>-like system for installing add-on packages to OpenWRT-based firmwares — it's called ipkg — but it's broken on the Fonera, and there's very little space for the installation of such packages.</p>
<p>You can get around this, but it's a little tricky. First: realize that ipkg is only <em>sort of</em> broken (on the newer firmwares, at least). You can't update the list of packages. You <em>can</em> locate a package, copy it over and do an &quot;ipkg install <em>filename</em>&quot;. You've just gotta find the right one. (Also: note that I've read that using ipkg to remove items on the Fonera can badly screw up your filesystem. Better to remove them manually and/or reformat your JFFS partition.)</p>
<p>Packages with &quot;mini&quot; in their name are probably your best bet. Now you just need to find a compatible one. From the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Supported_Devices">DD-WRT List of Supported Devices</a> we can see that the Fonera uses an Atheros chipset. Start running Google searches like <a class="reference external" href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=site%3Adownloads.openwrt.org+inurl%3Apackages+inurl%3Aatheros&amp;btnG=Search">this one</a> and you should be able to find what you need. Here, I'll make it easy for you: <a class="reference external" href="/2009/05/05/python_on_the_fonera/python-mini_2.5.1-2_mips.ipk">this is the ipkg I used to install python on the Fonera</a>. Copy it over to the Fonera with scp or something similar, then run &quot;ipkg install python-mini_2.5.1-2_mips.ipk&quot;. Success!</p>
<p>Well, until you try to do something with it. I needed three things out of this python installation: simple client/server network functionality (the socket module); the ability to fire off shell processes (the os module); and the ability to communicate with the Arduino over a serial link (the <a class="reference external" href="http://pyserial.wiki.sourceforge.net/pySerial">pySerial</a> project).</p>
<p>The first is pretty simple. For reasons that I haven't bothered to figure out, the socket module is named _socket in the minipython distribution. Adjust your scripts to do an &quot;import _socket as socket&quot; instead of &quot;import socket&quot; and you should be fine. I was able to run the first two examples (client and server) on <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.python.org/library/socket.html">this page</a>, anyway (debugging the other end of the connection with netcat on my laptop). Good enough for me!</p>
<p>Firing other programs runs into problems. Try to import the os module and you'll get some complaints about a missing UserDict class. I believe that this class wrapper has been deprecated; I cobbled <a class="reference external" href="/2009/05/05/python_on_the_fonera/UserDict.py">this UserDict.py</a> together from some Google searches, and after placing it in the lib-dynload path (on my router it's /jffs/usr/lib/python2.5/lib-dynload/), I can import the os module successfully. <em>I have not tested it thoroughly</em>. os.system('touch WHATEVER') works fine, but beyond that I can't make any guarantees.</p>
<p>Finally, there's the question of serial communication. This is actually harder than is may sound: there's a hardware issue we need to work out before we worry about pySerial at all.</p>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="/2008/03/26/dorkbot-dc-arduino-meet-fonera/">comments</a> on my Dorkbot post revealed a problem I didn't know I had: the serial voltage of the Arduino is different from the serial voltage of the Fonera. The former uses 5v, the latter uses 3.3v. This is a pretty common situation, actually, and it's generally solved through the use of a chip like the MAX232. Fortunately, we can get away with even less. The Arduino's designers anticipated this problem and made the device able to recognize 3.3v serial input, so signals from the Fonera to the Arduino should work fine. This is why my Dorkbot project worked even though I hadn't accounted for the voltage mismatch.</p>
<p>But the voltage differential of signals sent from the Arduino to the Fonera needs to be explicitly dealt with — we can't rely on the Fonera to handle the higher voltage as gracefully as the Arduino does. Fortunately, shedding DC voltage is a lot easier than boosting it, so this is also a pretty easy problem to solve. We just need to make a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.raltron.com/cust/tools/voltage_divider.asp">voltage divider</a> circuit that goes from 5v to 3.3v. It's basically two resistors, simply arranged. Easy! Alternately, you might be able to step the voltage down using the magic voltage-dropping properties of diodes, but I haven't bothered to try.</p>
<p>Alright! So our signals are aligned. Back to the software problems. pySerial requires the os module, but we've already solved that module's UserDict problem; on to the next headache. This one is called termios, and it's a compiled library, not just a python class. It's commonly included with python, but apparently not with the stripped-down version that we're using. That's a drag. We need a version of this library that has been compiled for the Fonera's MIPS processor. Compiling such a thing on a non-MIPS processor (like your computer) is possible, but cross-compilation is fairly involved to set up. I wanted to just find a compiled version and drop it in.</p>
<p>Once again, googling around downloads.openwrt.org turned out to be a good idea. But don't go looking for termios — you won't find it. Instead, I looked for a beefier python ipkg — one designed for more powerful machines, and which contains all of the normal libraries that ship with python. I found it, downloaded it and then uncompressed it (ipkgs are just tarball archives with a specific layout). That yielded two more tarballs; I opened the one named &quot;data.tar.gz&quot;. Within the directories spawned by that I found termios.so. I took that file, dropped it into the aforementioned /jffs/usr/lib/python2.5/lib-dynload/ directory, and was immediately able to import pyserial. Well, okay, not immediately — the first version of the python ipkg that I grabbed was built for mipsel processors, not mips, and gave me a helpful error message when I tried to import it. Once I had the right binary everything went surprisingly smoothly. I haven't currently got the necessary hardware set up to properly test pySerial, but will report back when I do.</p>
<p>For those of you trying to follow my steps exactly, <a class="reference external" href="/2009/05/05/python_on_the_fonera/termios.so">here's the termios.so that I'm using</a>. This method should work more generally for selectively loading python libraries that you need onto your Fonera.</p>
<p>Incidentally, all of this is a <em>massive</em> overengineering of what's necessary to finish my Artomatic project: those requirements could probably be satisfied with a wireless doorbell kit from Logan Hardware and a couple of <a class="reference external" href="/2007/06/15/beat-me-to-it/">555 ICs</a>. But I want this system to ultimately work over the internet, so for me it's worthwhile to create an IP-capable device.</p>

                    <p>I've been a little worn down all day. Yesterday <a class="reference external" href="http://www.grammarpolice.net">Kriston</a> and I set out to begin a batch of homebrewed wheat beer. But we did a bad job of estimating times and got a late start, and the result was a brewing operation that lasted until 3AM.</p>
<p>It seems to have gone fine, though. It wasn't yet bubbling by the time I left for work, but of course that was only a horrifically small number of hours since it went into the fermenter. By the time I got home from work it was bubbling away happily:</p>
<p>This is a marked improvement from my <a class="reference external" href="http://internetfoodassociation.com/2009/02/09/even-more-unwanted-foam/">last brewing attempt</a>, which spewed foam all over the goddamn place. This time the friendly folks at the Philly homebrew store gave me some Belgian Wyeast liquid yeast, and it seems to be a bit better behaved than True Brew's relatively vigorous stuff.</p>

<p>I can't help cringing when I watch this, but I really did have a good time, and I'm grateful for being given the opportunity to represent Sunlight.</p>
<p><em>Washington Journal</em> is an impressively high-volume operation — you're led into the studio and then it's almost immediately time to go. It's a little bit disorienting. The fact that the studio turns out to be exactly on the other side of wall on which the green room monitors are located doesn't help matters. <em>It's like a video window, man!</em> I appreciated the coffee and the chocolate croissant, but it seems like an even nicer thing to do for your guests would be to minimize the mind-bending spatial revelations that you expose them to.</p>
<p>I can't say I'm immensely pleased with my performance during the first half of the show, but things did improve as we got further in and moved on to topics that I've been working on for more than a couple of days (this recovery.gov stuff has been kind of sudden). By the twenty minute mark I was still acting weird and stilted, but not much more so than I do in real life. If I get another chance to do this maybe I'll find a way to speak fluidly for more than six syllables at a time — that's the dream, anyway.</p>
<p>I wish I had more amusing thoughts to share about the experience, but at the time I was too terrified to make many wry observations. Besides, I'm pretty sure that everyone who works in D.C. winds up on Washington Journal eventually — when I signed my name in the guestbook (marking myself as a total n00b, no doubt), I wasn't at all surprised to see the name of a friend-of-friends that I run into at parties a couple of lines above my own. What I'm trying to say is that you'll no doubt have a chance to have this experience yourself if you you have both a job in Washington and a collared shirt.</p>
<p>Oh yeah! They gave me a coffee mug! This small piece of proof (the above clip could of course be entirely computer-generated and for all I know is) is now my most prized media-appearance-related mug. Previously this position was held by the mug I received for my appearance at the NBC4 Health &amp; Fitness Expo, which involved walking in and helping myself to a complimentary mug. I think someone was getting crowd shots, though, so it totally counts.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>I stayed up way too late last night working on my piece for Artomatic. Playing with electronics can frequently be frustrating — everything goes wrong, then keeps going wrong, and at the end of the night you're left with nothing besides a pile of wasted components and a vague worry about how much lead you've just ingested. Other times, though, everything seems to go right, and that's how it went last night. There's still much more work to be done, but I'm making definite progress.</p>
<p>The piece in question involves a set of <a class="reference external" href="http://images.google.com/images?q=reception%20bell&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Search+Images">reception bells</a> that can be rung through electronic means, and the manual ringing of which can be similarly detected. The first part is done, in a proof-of-conceptish way — I have 12V solenoids installed that can push the clapper into the bell with satisfying vigor — but isn't completely wired up yet, largely because if you run a solenoid incorrectly it'll, er, melt.</p>
<p>The other major task is the detection of a manual ring. I initially thought I'd manage this by electrically isolating the clapper from the dome of the bell, then checking for a completed circuit between them. Ah, the naivete of youth. It turns out that this is a lousy way to make a circuit; worse, it's hard to solder wires onto an anodized bell; worse still, it's <em>really</em> hard to solder to a bell without changing its tone to something unpleasant.</p>
<p>Instead I decided to detect when the clapper breaks an infrared beam. <a class="reference external" href="http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/product_info.php?products_id=241">These things</a> seemed promising due to their physically decoupled nature, but there's no filter to prevent visible light from affecting the photodiode. This might've worked fine inside the darkness of the bell, but it made prototyping a pain.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/product_info.php?products_id=247">These</a> work much better, although the gap between the emitter and detector is juuuust too small to work with the bell's clappers. Bravely ignoring the package's admonishments to avoid breaking open devices made of gallium arsenide, I sawed 'em in half and mounted them with hot glue, and they've been working great ever since.</p>
<p>(Incidentally, I don't think I poisoned myself — the GaAs is only used for the actual semiconducting materials, not the mounting armature, and the package allowed me to see that I would only be cutting plastic if I separated the two halves.)</p>
<p>Here are the fruits of my labor: a creepy video of yours truly showing off an LED blinking in time to the dings of the bell. I still have a minor issue to resolve related to one clapper's tendency to bounce (mechanically, not electrically), but I think I can account for that behavior in software.</p>

<p>Next I'll be prototyping the full bell-strike-detection solution; doing the same for the solenoid; soldering those working circuits onto the breakout/power board; adding active cooling to the case; getting two way serial communication working between the Fonera and Arduino; writing the final software; and then doing the boring, non-electronic stuff: staining, sanding, installation. I've got about a month to get it all done, and right now I'm feeling pretty good about it. But there are certainly still a lot of loose ends.</p>
<p>Speaking of which! Anybody got a pair of bar stools or similarly-sized tables that I can borrow for the month of June?</p>

                    <p>With apologies to my MBA-possessing friends: <a class="reference external" href="http://www.abc.net.au/rn/backgroundbriefing/stories/2009/2526727.htm">the case against MBAs</a>.</p>
<p>Not that the degree's really worthless, of course. As the above-linked transcript acknowledges, it's an admission ticket to certain spheres of money and power. And the introduction to financial and economic concepts that the associated coursework provides is something I frequently wish I had. But while I won't say that I outright <em>dismissed</em> any resumes because of it — that wouldn't be very responsible of me — seeing the degree on a programmer's resume has definitely prompted me to record a mental strike against them.</p>
<p>In that case it's because I was specifically looking looking for focused technicians. But speaking more broadly, I think the folks quoted in the above-linked transcript are right when they discuss how the brand of generalism afforded by a business education — as distinct from the type produced by a liberal arts education — can be pretty grating to the rest of us, particularly when it's wielded by someone unaware of its limitations. Fortunately, nearly all of the MBAs I know are quick to acknowledge those limits; most of them <em>do</em> have an education in something substantial; and none of them, so far as I know, willingly read management books.</p>
<p>Anti-business sentiment is obviously at its high water mark right now; other than our normal societal baseline of simmering anti-authoritarianism, we shouldn't expect it to last. But for anyone who's worked under a hapless b-school acolyte, the last few months have been something of a golden age. That they're producing radio programs embodying this resentment (rather than just NBC sitcoms) seems noteworthy.</p>

                    <p>I have not been having good bicycle luck. Since Friday I've ruptured five innertubes and had two tire levers snap. The flats have forced me to walk through the cold, then the rain, then the cold again; I've had to skip appointments and be late to work and walk in bad shoes until my feet ache. My fingers are suffused with brake dust; my hands look like they belong to a Pompeiian mummy.</p>
<p>And yet! I am now <em>so much faster</em> at changing tires, and this feeling of accomplishment almost makes up for all of the hassle. The operation requires finesse, see, and you tend to accidentally hurt yourself and waste time and materials when you're still getting the hang of it. But now I have the hang of it! I don't do those things anymore! It's great!</p>
<p>Well, alright, I'm still wasting materials at a phenomenal clip. But there's a reliable and thoroughly pleasant honeymoon period of about forty minutes before the newly-installed innertube explodes, and that's enough for basking. Tomorrow the offending rim goes back to the bike shop and people who objectively know what they're doing; for now, for me, the subjective experience is going to have to be sufficient.</p>

                    <p>I've committed myself to getting something ready in time for <a class="reference external" href="http://www.artomatic.org">Artomatic</a>, and that probably means that my GTFS explorations will be delayed for a bit. It's probably for the best, given the timing of the iPhone 3 SDK.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the folks who run the Chinatown bus frown on the use of soldering irons while in transit, so I did spend a little time writing scripts to chew through the dataset. At this point I have 85,921 CSV files delineating exactly where each bus or train is supposed to be on a second-by-second basis during a typical weekday. Well, alright, not exactly: when a unit is between two stops I just interpolate its position linearly — &quot;as the crow flies&quot;, in other words. Still, sort of neat. Fun fact: under the current schedule, the last trip of weekday Metro service concludes on exactly the 100,000th second of the day (which is actually part of the next day, but the trip started before midnight).</p>
<p>Anyway, by counting the lines in each file, I was able to generate the following graph. It shows pretty much what you'd expect: there are a hell of a lot of active trips during rush hour. Still, it feels good to have wrangled with a dataset of this size and produced an actual image from it. Also: there must be well over a thousand Metro and Metrobus operators out there! It explains a few things: given those numbers, you can see how it's essentially a statistical certainty that on any given day one of them will <a class="reference external" href="http://dcist.com/2009/03/why_did_a_metrobus_driver_punch_mcg.php">punch someone in a mascot costume</a>.</p>

                    <p>It looks like <a class="reference external" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/8003799.stm">some of the folks behind The Pirate Bay are heading to jail</a>. I'm only a little surprised, and certainly not outraged. The people running TPB have always seemed imprudently defiant, and even though I was glad to see them take technical and political steps to hasten the inevitable (let's get on with it already!), their tendency to argue from positions of transparently bad faith never sat well with me. In the past I'd always shrugged and said that things sure were different in Sweden. Well, not that different, I guess.</p>
<p>The aftermath is proving to be pretty pathetic. Just look at the quotes from those found guilty (&quot;It's so bizarre that we were convicted&quot;); look at the site's <a class="reference external" href="http://thepiratebay.org/special/2009epicwinanyhow.php">&quot;press conference&quot; page</a> (&quot;So, the dice courts judgement is here. It was lol to read and hear, crazy verdict.&quot;). I couldn't bear to watch much of the video, in which some apparent TPB associates natter about Twitter vs. Jaiku and then begin whining about the length of legal documents and how something couldn't possibly be a criminal conspiracy if the participants barely even IM that much.</p>
<p>The gravity of the situation seems to have not yet struck the people involved — either that or Swedish prisons are awfully cushy. The first thing that comes to mind is that <a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Dov9ihrIG8&amp;eurl=http://yourgirlfriend.org/?page_id=94&amp;feature=player_embedded">hipster government</a> video that Jeff found a while back. The second is the quick transition from <a class="reference external" href="http://tehpaine.blogspot.com/2007/10/some-of-you-guys-have-been-asking-for.html">defiance</a> to <a class="reference external" href="http://tehpaine.blogspot.com/2008/02/oinks-bail-extended.html">silence</a> on the blog created in the wake of the arrest of the operator of the Oink Bittorrent tracker. These guys are not yet the martyrs they think they are. But I have a feeling they're going to be.</p>
<p>Of course, the IP industry has been unable to pass up this opportunity to make itself look even more pathetic and ridiculous than the young men who are headed to jail:</p>
<blockquote>
Speaking to the BBC, the chairman of industry body the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) John Kennedy said the verdict sent out a clear message. [...] &quot;There has been a perception that piracy is OK and that the music industry should just have to accept it. This verdict will change that,&quot; he said.</blockquote>
<p>Right. Good luck with that, fellas. The site <a class="reference external" href="http://piratebay.org">isn't even down</a>.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Matt IMs to point out that actually, yes, Swedish prisons are incredibly cushy. He sends <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3261698,00.html">two</a> <a class="reference external" href="http://www.kriminalvarden.se/templates/KVV_InfopageGeneral____4051.aspx">links</a> to prove it, and they're awfully convincing. It seems as though the approach is closer to a halfway house than to a prison as we conceive of it in the US. So hey, maybe the TPB folks do understand the situation. On the other hand, the convicted are also facing a multi-million-dollar penalty. On the other other hand, they've got genuine <a class="reference external" href="http://www.piratpartiet.se/">political support</a>. I still suspect that the TPB operators are going to have a worse time of it than their current behavior implies that they expect, but it doesn't sound like this will ruin anyone's life, and I doubt that the site will go down.</p>
<p><strong>ALSO:</strong> You should probably check out <a class="reference external" href="http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/archives/2009/04/metaphorical_pirates.php">Matt's own post</a> on the matter.</p>

                    <p>Rob Pegoraro, the Post's technology columnist, <a class="reference external" href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/fasterforward/2009/04/who_are_you_calling_a_software.html">is looking for alternative names for software theft</a> that aren't associated with, ahem, maritime terrorism:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">The NYT's always-interesting Freakonomics blog <a class="reference external" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/04/13/is-it-time-to-rename-digital-piracy/">raised that question</a> yesterday. Stephen J. Dubner wrote that &quot;as real-life pirate attacks have gained in intensity, violence, and geopolitical meaning, talking about digital thieves as pirates has come to seem clever to a fault, and inaccurate too.&quot;</div>
<div class="line">The Business Software Alliance, a trade group devoted to stopping people from using commercial software without paying for it first, does not agree. Also yesterday, the CNet tech-news site reported that a BSA publicist sent an e-mail explicitly comparing thugs hijacking supertankers to software thieves: &quot;Piracy takes many forms, some more violent than others.&quot;</div>
<div class="line">(Writer Gordon Haff called that e-mail &quot;one of the most tone-deaf and cynically opportunistic PR pitches I've seen for quite some time.&quot;)</div>
<div class="line">[...]</div>
<div class="line">Blogger John Gruber suggests the term &quot;bootlegging,&quot; but I'm not sure about that noun either. To me (a one-time concert reviewer for the Post), it evokes homemade recordings from concerts, an activity that demands individual initiative and, when done right, creativity. Installing a copy of a program on two computers doesn't require much of those qualities.</div>
<div class="line">&quot;Software theft&quot; itself suffers the problem that theft, by definition, involves the victims losing the stolen property [...] That doesn't happen with digital media, where somebody installing a not-paid-for copy of Office doesn't stop your copy, mine or Steve Ballmer's from working. Rather, the key concept here is that somebody has short-circuited a normal business transaction through deceit or trickery. And for that, the most apt definition appears to be &quot;fraud&quot;</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Fraud is not a good term for this, as the software consumer is not misrepresenting his or herself, and in fact generally has no interaction at all with the software vendor. &quot;Fraud&quot; implies that the victimized party has been manipulated into surrendering something of value under false pretenses. That doesn't really apply to these cases.</p>
<p>Gruber's suggestion of &quot;bootleggers&quot; is better than &quot;fraud&quot;, but it's unfortunately normative in that most people now consider Prohibition (which is what most people think of when they hear &quot;bootlegging&quot;) to have been an unreasonable imposition by the government — as a result, in this case the terminology would imply that software appropriation is legitimate.</p>
<p>A better description would be &quot;freeloaders&quot;, as users of unlicensed proprietary software are extracting value from a system without supporting it themselves. It also has a pun in it, since they're &quot;loading&quot; the software on their machines! Obviously this should count as a major strike against it.</p>
<p>Even though I couldn't resist leaving in an irrelevant quote beating up on them, in the end I have to side with the BSA. Not because &quot;piracy&quot; is a great term for software theft — it's manipulative and inaccurate — but because <em>that's what we have been and will continue to call it</em>.</p>
<p>I don't mean to just rail against the evolution of language in a reflexive, let's-bitch-about-political-correctness sort of way. But the fact that some people are suddenly feeling guilty for previously having a whimsical attitude toward all things piratical strikes me as pretty silly. Surprise: there are a lot of idioms with horrific literal meanings that we regularly deploy lightheartedly — &quot;highway robbery&quot;, &quot;scared to death&quot;, &quot;thrown under the bus&quot; — these would all be unpleasant things to experience! Tragedy + time = comedy and all that. Enjoying the amusing caricature of piracy that we've developed over the last several decades is not the same thing as dismissing the horrors of real-life piracy.</p>
<p>Now: who wants to play some Halo 3 tonight? I promise to feel at least little bad when I use the sniper rifle.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>Since the release of WMATA's GTFS dataset I've been reading up on iPhone application development, and in particular the <a class="reference external" href="http://phonegap.com/">PhoneGap development framework</a>. Traditional iPhone development requires a lot of specialized knowledge and the use of Objective C, a language that's used for Apple development and not much else. It takes a significant investment of time to get up to speed.</p>
<p>PhoneGap helps developers sidestep this hassle by providing a ready-to-build iPhone project that moves development tasks into the more popular world of the web. The iPhone app that results is basically a chromeless browser plus some Javascript bindings to iPhone capabilities that a normal webapp couldn't reach — things like GPS, the accelerometer and data storage. Any hack Javascript jockey (hi!) can get an app running using his or her existing skills. The result probably won't be as silky-smooth as a wholly-native app, but it'll be a lot better than a page pulled across the network and into Mobile Safari. And, crucially, it can be listed in the App Store.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it looks like Apple doesn't like this idea. More and more often the phonegap email list includes cited messages like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Upon review of your application, [APPLICATION NAME] cannot be posted to the App Store due to the usage of private API. Usage of such non-public API, as outlined in the iPhone SDK Agreement section 3.3.2 is prohibited:</div>
<div class="line">&quot;An Application may not itself install or launch other executable code by any means, including without limitation through use of a plug-in architecture, calling other frameworks, other APIs or otherwise. No interpreted code may be downloaded and used in an Application except for code that is interpreted and run by Apple's Published APIs and built-in interpreter(s).&quot;</div>
<div class="line">The PhoneGap API implemented in your application is an external framework.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>So far the other folks on the mailing list suggest doing a search &amp; replace for the word &quot;phonegap&quot; and then resubmitting the app in the hope that the next reviewer will be less of a stickler.</p>
<p>But these rejections may very well reflect a deliberate policy on Apple's part rather than a mere bureaucratic screw-up. The company consistently introduces roadblocks to development, from their stringent interface guidelines to their nasty habit of charging developers for the privilege of popularizing the company's platforms. Right now, for instance, code and documentation that lets devs experiment with the 3.0 iPhone software — which, among other things, puts Google Maps capabilities in the hands of developers — requires a $99 membership in the Apple Developer program. Worse, that membership often takes an unpredictably long time to be processed — sometimes months.</p>
<p>The intent seems to be to raise the bar on development such that only high-quality software from dedicated, skilled individuals makes its way onto Apple products. It's a a coherent strategy, and certainly in keeping with Apple's position as a premium brand. But it's also a serious drag for developers, diminishes the variety and inflates the pricing of the Apple software universe, and generally imposes yet another cost on Apple users in order to maintain the company's elite reputation.</p>

Most of the entries on <a class="reference external" href="http://www.fmylife.com">FML</a> are about minor inconveniences or embarrassments. #whoops! would be a more apt hashtag.</p>
<p>There are occasional outliers that begin to get at the point of the exercise (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.fmylife.com/work/850361">this</a> is on the right track, though the execution is clunky). But it's clear that most of the entries are from fresh-faced twenty year-olds who rarely, if ever, find themselves using the phrase &quot;alone in an uncaring universe&quot;. For these jokes to work their implications need to stretch further into the future than next week. Otherwise the natural response is, &quot;That's too bad, but I'm sure things will pick up soon.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I was remiss in not linking to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.en-dash.com/blog">Jake</a>'s <a class="reference external" href="http://dumbfml.tumblr.com/">effort to highlight the worst FMLs</a>. And it reminds me to mention my other objection to this whole business: how transparently fake most of the entries are. Really, some slight effort toward plausibility is not too much to ask.</p>

                    <p>Like <a class="reference external" href="http://blogstretch.blogspot.com/2009/04/well.html">Amanda said</a>, the Harlem Shakes show is unfortunately cancelled. That's too bad; I sent the band an email saying I hoped to have a chance to see them soon, and a note to DC9 saying I hoped to see my money again, ever. To date, both remain unanswered.</p>
<p>I think this tips the karmic scales in favor of sharing an MP3, don't you? So here, have a listen to &quot;Strictly Game&quot;. This may not be the best track for hooking people — &quot;<a class="reference external" href="http://hypem.com/search/harlem+shakes+sunlight/1/">Sunlight</a>&quot; is pretty clearly the catchiest, danciest thing on the record — but it's the track I'm currently most enamored with. But hey, they're all pretty good — the title track's the only one I'm lukewarm on.</p>

<p>And don't miss Amanda's concert-grief-counseling strategy — that Pomegranates track she posted is awfully good, even if naming your band after the world's most overhyped fruit is practically begging for dismissive reviews.</p>

                    <p>Last week <a class="reference external" href="http://www.juliansanchez.com/2009/04/02/sic-transit-gloria-conde/">Julian got laid off</a>, part of a bloodbath at Ars that resulted from the Conde Nast powers-that-be deciding that having excellent, industry-leading online properties didn't fit with their long-term business strategy of making it to retirement without being bothered.</p>
<p>This was pretty disappointing to see, both as a friend and as someone who enjoys reading quality journalism about tech policy. However! Just because he's no longer being paid to cover, say, government wiretapping, doesn't mean that he isn't <a class="reference external" href="http://www.juliansanchez.com/2009/04/07/solution-to-the-fringe-glyph-cipher/">making contributions to our cultural discourse</a>. I can only assume this is what inspired Yglesias to <a class="reference external" href="http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/archives/2009/04/social_production_and_demographic_changes.php">write this</a>.</p>
<p>(Lest anyone think I'm teasing Julian, let me remind you that I'm the same guy who once <a class="reference external" href="http://www.zunta.org/blog/archives/2006/05/11/lost_the_plot/">meticulously converted the Dharma Initiative logo into a vector graphics format</a> — I'm not a fan of <em>Fringe</em>, but being the first to crack its code is pretty cool.)</p>
