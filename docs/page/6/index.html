                    <p><a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/konklone/status/367787595427622912">Eric asked me what I think of the Tessel</a>! Well, sort of. Anyway I find myself delighted to have semi-informed thoughts about hobbyist microcontroller-y solutions. It's a pleasant byproduct of all the time I've spent on silly electronics projects over the last decade, and makes me feel better about my own perpetually-dawning software senescence.</p>
<p>But so: the Tessel. Will it succeed? Is it worthwhile? You can read about it <a class="reference external" href="http://technical.io/">here</a> but the important details are that it's got wifi and a bunch of <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Purpose_Input/Output">GPIOs</a> and its development environment is built around Javascript -- so much so that it can allegedly run many many node.js packages!</p>
<p>That's all potentially interesting, but its odds of success can't be understood outside of the environment it enters. So let's talk about the two gorillas in the hobbyist space: Arduino and Raspberry Pi.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> is a really cheap Linux computer with 256 MB of RAM. Like, $25 cheap. No onboard wifi -- it'll cost you another $10 to add ethernet (and double the RAM), or about the same for a USB wifi adapter. But it's a pretty capable little system! There are some GPIOs, but not that many, and they're not that robust, and there's only one hardware PWM output, which is annoying if you know what that means. It's also not open source. Still, it's a genuine Linux system, which makes it able to harness an&nbsp;<em>immensely</em> powerful library of software. And its makers&nbsp;seem to have a sweetheart deal with Broadcom that enables their price point.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://arduino.cc/">Arduino</a> is a friendly microcontroller environment, and I should probably explain what that means. A microcontroller (uC) is a little computer -- so little that it suffers really serious limitations. For instance, it'll usually have less than 1MB of memory, and it'll run thousands of times slower than your laptop CPU, and it'll only be able to manipulate integers and have no video output or keyboard input. Pretty sad! On the other hand, it only costs a couple of bucks. And this list of capabilities isn't too dissimilar to, say, the videogame systems you had growing up (if you're as venerable as me, anyway).</p>
<p>The cheapness of uCs mean they can be singleminded. Your computer is doing a ton of things all the time. Its most fundamental pieces of software decide how to split up processor time between those things, like a library of fantastically complicated clockwork systems that need to be cranked forward, one at a time, by one very spritely curator. The curator has pretty good instincts about how to manage her charges, but sometimes she remembers it's time to rebuild your search index or sync your system clock or check for Chrome updates or whatever, which means everything else might not get her attention right when you expected it would.</p>
<p>This is mostly fine, but it doesn't work very well when you need extremely precise timing. Everything is&nbsp;<em>so fast</em>&nbsp;that it's mostly still pretty precise (and you can pursue some <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTLinux">ridiculous hacks</a> to make it more precise still). But when you're dealing with the real world, or finicky electrical systems, the need for very precise timing comes up more often than you'd think.</p>
<p>Microcontrollers are pretty good for this kind of thing. They can just sit there running one program because they're so cheap. The curator's attention is undivided; her behavior is predictable.</p>
<p>Arduino isn't actually a chip, it's a development and deployment environment wrapped around a particular family of chips made by Atmel. It makes it a&nbsp;<em>hell</em> of a lot easier to write code for those chips. Even that comes at a cost. My <a class="reference external" href="/2012/01/02/ok-this-is-the-last-led-christmas-lights-video/">dumb Christmas lights</a> require communication in 10 microsecond pulses (rather pokey as these things go). But if you look at the &quot;Timing&quot; section of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/279657/Simulating-and-controlling-GE-Color-Effects-Lights">this post you'll</a> see that to fake a 10-ish microsecond delay on Arduino you need to tell it to delayMicroseconds(3) or delayMicroseconds(4) depending on the Atmel chip. The Arduino environment introduces overhead -- it's a bit finicky. Still! The Arduino is&nbsp;<em>much</em>&nbsp;better about this stuff than the Raspberry Pi.</p>
<p>(In the real world, sophisticated processors deal with applications that require precise timing requirements by speaking to microcontroller-like chips that handle their responsibilities precisely, but which can also speak to the main processor in a relatively timing-insensitive manner. Your sound card -- or, more likely, the part of your processor that used to be a distinct component called a sound card -- is a good example. Some of my current projects use a Raspberry Pi to speak to an Arduino to speak to an <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ti.com/product/tlc5940">LED controller chip</a>, which is less silly than it probably sounds.)</p>
<p>So! Enough preamble. Where does the Tessel lie on this continuum?</p>
<p>I think it's almost certainly going to be more Pi-like than Arduino-like. The fact that it's Javascript-focused is notable (though it's also worth noting that <a class="reference external" href="http://beagleboard.org/Support/BoneScript">the BeagleBone -- a Raspberry Pi precursor -- also pushes a JS-first approach</a>). It's a testament to the shockingly widespread impact of the V8 engine on our technical culture -- one of the many genuinely unselfish things that Google has given to the world. &nbsp;We'll have to remember this when they're forcibly uploading our brains a few years from now.</p>
<p>Could the Tessel run a Javascript environment in some incredibly constrained manner that allows for precise, uC-like timing? Eh. Maybe? It seems pretty unlikely to me, particularly given all the general-purpose node.js packages that it claims to support. If you want a high level of precision, you need to know about and account for everything the system is doing. That means you can't work at a particularly high level of abstraction, as the Arduino example above hopefully demonstrates. You probably need to write assembly or C, not an interpreted language like JS that passes through a black box of voodoo optimizations. This is particularly true for an environment like node.js that emphasizes asynchronous approaches with somewhat unpredictable timing (says the guy who's never written any node.js code).&nbsp;And even if that sort of thing were easy to do in node, all those package authors would not have done it, since the Tessel didn't exist when they did their work.</p>
<p>It seems most likely that the Tessel will be a stripped down *nix environment (the Tessel's processor is a cheaper installment from the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ti.com/product/am3358">same ARM family that powers the BeagleBone</a>). But it'll only have 32 MB of RAM! You can run a <a class="reference external" href="https://openwrt.org/">tiny OS</a> in that -- <a class="reference external" href="/2008/03/26/dorkbot-dc-arduino-meet-fonera/">I've done it plenty</a>. But it's going to suck in various ways. And I'm not really convinced it's going to be cheaper than the much more capable $25 Raspberry Pi.</p>
<p>The Arduino, meanwhile, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.radioshack.com/product/index.jsp?productId=12268262">is waiting at your neighborhood Radioshack for $30</a>, and&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_odkw=arduino&amp;_osacat=0&amp;_from=R40&amp;_trksid=p2045573.m570.l1313.TR10.TRC2.A0.Xiduino&amp;_nkw=iduino&amp;_sacat=0">Chinese clones can be easily had for $7</a> or <a class="reference external" href="http://www.instructables.com/id/The-RRRRRRRRRRBA-or-What-They-Dont-Teach-You-in-/">less</a>.</p>
<p>The Tessel, I think, aims to land between Arduino and the Pi. And that's not crazy. Making this stuff more accessible is really worthwhile! Building a lovely little network-capable platform with handy modular sensors and helper libraries is worthwhile! Getting an Arduino online is terrible and expensive, and the Raspberry Pi's universe of <a class="reference external" href="http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoShields">shields</a> is still a bit underwhelming. There is good work yet to be done.</p>
<p>But both of those projects are hugely popular. You shouldn't underestimate how important those network effects are. I spent a ton of time on BeagleBone, then gave up. Other than price, it is a much better platform than Raspberry Pi: it's fully open, has more GPIOs and a better processor. But people got&nbsp;<em>so excited</em> about the Pi, thanks in large part to the enormous publicity it attracted. Seemingly overnight I could pick from&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://learn.adafruit.com/category/learn-raspberry-pi">a million awesome tutorials penned by brilliant people eager to figure stuff out for me</a>. Same goes for Arduino.</p>
<p>Could Tessel carve out a new niche? Sure. I think it'd have to offer something new, though, and I'm not sure it does. The Tessel looks nice, but it's probably not going to be cheap enough or offer enough additional utility over established platforms to become a huge success. You can run node.js on a Pi, after all.</p>

                    <p>Calvino books are Calvino books. They're rewarding if approached in the right mindset. What distinguishes them is simply their framing, and this wasn't my favorite. Drained of verbs, these descriptions of cities reflect thinking that is often profound, though also sometimes banal (yes, suburbs often seem alike). There's a few too many setups involving superficial duality and an ensuing revelation of redemptive humanist imperfection.</p>
<p>So: pretty good. Cosmicomics and Mr. Palomar remain my favorites, though.</p>

                    <p>Eh. It's clever, writing a book like this one as a follow-up to his own debut. Diving headlong into mystic Christian conspiracy theories, Eco cleverly parodies himself while leveling a broader critique against the human temptation toward gnosis and syncretism. The action surrounding our main characters is also pretty fun.</p>
<p>But the damn thing's just way too long. Eco tells us over and over again that these imagined connections are meaningless, which makes it difficult to wade through hundreds of pages of historical arcana. By the end, exhaustion had distracted me from his characters' stories and struggles. A decent editor could have made this great. As it stands, Eco can't resist the temptation to show off, whether through his own (always modestly disclaimed!) flights of historical fancy, or with inserted experimental fiction that left me cold.</p>
<p>As a sidenote: it was legitimately fascinating to see so much occultism cleanly laid out. I found myself wondering if Mike Mignola used this as a blueprint for his Hellboy universe or if the grail conspiracies are just well-established. But it's all there: the Templars, Ultimate Thule, Aggartha and on and on...</p>

                    <p>Carlos Ruiz Zafon is a talented writer and a miraculous self-promoter. <em>The Angel's Game</em> -- like <em>The Shadow of the Wind</em> -- will leave you convinced that you've read a better book than you have. But that doesn't mean you shouldn't read it.</p>
<p>In the case of TAG, the approach is fairly straightforward. Ruiz Zafon reverentially invokes the institution of Literature in all its forms, from a refuge for the young; to the pretentious journalistic elevation of copyediting into a sacred crusade; to the fucking smell of books; to the invocation of Dickens to canonize the institution of the blood- and melodrama-soaked potboiler.</p>
<p>This is all fine so far as it goes. Its real purpose is to telegraph what's about to come -- to create a theology of letters in which pulp holds a place of esteem no less dignified than nominally loftier stuff. Ruiz Zafon is going to give us pulp. He wants us to understand it to be exalted pulp.</p>
<p>I think this perspective is basically right. It reminds me of Michael Chabon's essays insisting that literature can include acts of imagination, excitement, adventure and the fantastic. As I steel myself for this year's Man Booker long list, it's good to be reminded that &quot;good&quot; books don't necessarily have to be about terminal illness and divorce.</p>
<p>Still, I do think that this framing is at least a little self-serving. Which is fine: Ruiz Zafon delivers a real page-turner, and ably adorns it with literary allusions and devices (albeit occasionally heavy-handed ones). The book has some problems with pacing, and the emotional pallette favors breadth over depth. But it's pretty great entertainment, ably weaving together thrills, supernatural horror, sexual tension, tragic romance, satire, noir and light comedy.</p>
<p>But I do worry that I will remember that this book is good more than I'll remember what the book is about. That's certainly the case with <em>The Shadow of the Wind</em> -- I remember where I read it, I and I remember liking it, but I remember terribly little of the book itself, which is pretty unusual for me. Perhaps TAG will fare better.</p>

                    <p>Pretty brutal. I'm ashamed to admit this is the first Roth I've read -- my mom sent this to me -- but based on his reputation and my sense of the book, it's hard for me to imagine this is among his best.</p>
<p>The problem is really just length. Roth wants to throw together some research about summer camp and polio and musings about theodicy. The polio asserts itself through the decimation of various basically interchangeable children surrounding the protagonist, who's a youth educator. But he's a flat and boringly noble character, devoid of psychology aside from overdeveloped senses of duty and guilt. These ensure that polio will destroy him utterly, even after the crisis of the epidemic has passed. And that could could be interesting.</p>
<p>But instead of that tragic flaw's artful revelation, the dynamics of it are dumped on us by the narrator in the book's last ten pages. It feels rushed and unnecessary. Those ten pages are solid, and include this gut-punch about bitterness:</p>
<p>&quot;I'll never be me as I was me in the past. I'll be this instead for the rest of my life. I'll never know delight again.&quot;</p>
<p>Oof. Preach. Anyway it's more of a sermon than anything else.</p>
<p>Still, great prose and a quick read. It's really just a novella, though. Could easily have been a proper novel but you get the feeling the author's heart wasn't in it.</p>

                    <p>Though not totally meritless, it's safe to say this was not a favorite of mine. I had two primary objections.</p>
<p>First, Becks got it about right when she said &quot;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/616331308">I've never read a book that got technology as wrong as this</a>.&quot; Much of the technobabble reads like <a class="reference external" href="http://www.theonion.com/articles/fasttalking-computer-hacker-just-has-to-break-thro,32000/">this Onion article</a>. It's gibberish -- nonsense that's clearly been passed by a technologist for vocabulary-correction, but which is conceptually empty. I can usually forgive this (though after been recently treated to the very high technical standards of Cory Doctorow's work, I'm less inclined to do so that I used to be). But in this case the nonsense is used both to define the various maguffins that drives much of the story and to provide the too-tidy resolution that our protagonist drops in the climax. And where the hell did Wilson get the idea that overloaded computers can <em>melt</em>? It's completely laughable.</p>
<p>Second, I was pretty uncomfortable with the book's politics. I have complaints about the facile approach to political unrest -- the restoration of mobile broadband is treated as if it's the same thing as a popular uprising's successful conclusion. But these are superficial compared to my discomfort with Wilson's sympathy for Islamist counterpoints to the repressive secular state that employs the book's villains. I'm very ready to admit the beauty, wisdom and historical richness of muslims' faith. I'm less prepared to accept Wilson's glib assumption of compatibility between her readership's liberal cosmopolitan values and her religion's ethics and politics. Of <em>course</em> the imam wouldn't <em>really</em> object to popular music. Of <em>course</em> our plucky female lead wears her veil out of choice. I'm sure it's right that this culture is misunderstood and often subjected to ignorant racism. But that doesn't mean its attitudes toward women and personal liberty aren't genuinely noxious. Wilson doesn't ignore this completely, but she's much too ready to retreat into mysticism when it comes up.</p>
<p>I understand Wilson to be a convert to Islam herself (married to an Egyptian man) so I don't want to accuse her of cultural ignorance, or to underestimate the difficulty of reconciling her identity and values with the religious culture she's chosen. I'm sure that's been a difficult and very personal process, and one that I have no right to criticise. But, speaking purely as an outside observer, the philosophical gymnastics that seem to be required don't survive the translation to the page. Frankly, she's got some nerve to snipe at western fiction for its substantive bankruptcy. Her work ignores those depths.</p>
<p>OK. Enough of that. What's good about this book? Well, Wilson's a comic book writer (I suspect this explains a bunch of the silly GR Stephenson comparisons that Becks notes). She has a talent for keeping the action moving and for letting her imagination stretch to interesting locales, characters, scales. They don't always feel fully sketched-out -- perhaps she's used to collaborating with an artist on that? -- but she does often succeed. I particularly enjoyed the inclusion of the djinn, even if the narrative bridge constructed to them -- the Alf Yeom -- didn't really make much sense.</p>
<p>Still, I don't think the book succeeds. The scaffolding's there (though it's at least one act too long), but the foundation's incoherent. Not recommended.</p>

<p>In Ersilia, to establish the relationships that sustain the city's life, the inhabitants stretch strings from the corners of the houses, white or black or gray of black-and-white according to whether they mark a relationship of blood, of trade, authority, agency. When the strings become so numerous that you can no longer pass among them, the inhabitants leave: the houses are dismantled; only the strings and their supports remain.</p>
<p>From a mountainside, camping within their household goods, Ersilia refugees look at the labyrinth of taut strings and poles that rise in the plain. That is the city of Ersilia still, and they are nothing.</p>
<p>They rebuild Ersilia elsewhere. They weave a similar pattern of strings which they would like to be more complex and at the same time more regular than the other. Then they abandon it and take themselves and their houses still farther away.</p>
<p>Then, when traveling in the territory of Ersilia, you come upon the ruins of the abandoned cities, without the walls which do not last, without the bones of the dead which the wind rolls away: spiderwebs of intricate relationships seeking a form.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>I mostly like my Sonos system. The downsides: I had a controller die on me out of warranty; it's a bit pricey; and it doesn't have Airplay support. This last one, at least, turns out to be fixable, thanks to a few open source projects and the Raspberry Pi.</p>
<p>The ingredients:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/abrasive/shairport">Shairport project</a>, for providing Airplay</li>
<li>the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/SoCo/SoCo">SoCo</a> project, for controlling the Sonos</li>
</ul>
<p>This last one is important for making the Sonos start listening to its line-in when Airplay begins to be used.</p>
<p>Getting your Raspberry Pi on your wifi network is a bit of a pain. You'll need to compile Shairport's dependencies and install some modules from CPAN. SoCo's setup.py doesn't leave you with a working installation, but the codebase is fine if you use it directly.</p>
<p>With all the pieces in place, you just need a script like this to switch the Sonos:</p>
<p><code><div class="line-block">
<div class="line">import re, sys</div>
<div class="line">from soco import SonosDiscovery, SoCo</div>
</div>
</p><div class="line-block">
<div class="line">def main():</div>
<div class="line">sd = SonosDiscovery()</div>
<div class="line">possible_matches = sd.get_speaker_ips()</div>
<div class="line">speaker_info = {}</div>
<div class="line">for ip in possible_matches:</div>
<div class="line">s = SoCo(ip)</div>
<div class="line">try:</div>
<div class="line">speaker_info[ip] = s.get_speaker_info()</div>
<div class="line">except Exception, e:</div>
<div class="line">speaker_info[ip] = {}</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">for (ip, speaker) in speaker_info.items():</div>
<div class="line">if re.search(sys.argv[1], speaker.get('zone_name', ''), re.I) is not None:</div>
<div class="line">s = SoCo(ip)</div>
<div class="line">s.switch_to_line_in()</div>
<div class="line">s.play()</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">if __name__ == '__main__':</div>
<div class="line">main()</div>
</div>
<p>and then to start the Shairport daemon like so:</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">perl <span class="pre">/home/pi/sonos-airplay/shairport.pl</span> <span class="pre">-d</span> <span class="pre">-w</span> <span class="pre">/home/pi/sonos-airplay/shairport.pid</span> <span class="pre">-l</span> 100 <span class="pre">--apname=&quot;Sonos&quot;</span> <span class="pre">--play_prog=&quot;/home/pi/.virtualenvs/sonos/bin/python</span> <span class="pre">/home/pi/sonos-airplay/set_line_in.py</span> bedroom&quot;</tt></p>
<p>This will call the <em>set_line_in.py</em> script every time a new Airplay client connects.</p>
<p>For good measure, here's the /etc/init.d/shairport startup file I'm using:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">#!/bin/sh</span></tt></div>
<div class="line"><tt class="docutils literal"># /etc/init.d/shairport</tt></div>
<div class="line"><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">PIUSER='pi'</span></tt></div>
<div class="line"><tt class="docutils literal">case &quot;$1&quot; in</tt></div>
<div class="line"><tt class="docutils literal">start)</tt></div>
<div class="line"><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/home/pi/sonos-airplay/start_shairport.sh</span></tt></div>
<div class="line"><tt class="docutils literal">echo &quot;Starting Shairport Server for $PIUSER &quot;</tt></div>
<div class="line"><tt class="docutils literal">;;</tt></div>
<div class="line"><tt class="docutils literal">stop)</tt></div>
<div class="line"><tt class="docutils literal">kill `cat <span class="pre">/home/pi/sonos-airplay/shairport.pid`</span></tt></div>
<div class="line"><tt class="docutils literal">echo &quot;Shairport Server stopped&quot;</tt></div>
<div class="line"><tt class="docutils literal">;;</tt></div>
<div class="line"><tt class="docutils literal">*)</tt></div>
<div class="line"><tt class="docutils literal">echo &quot;Usage: /etc/init.d/shairport {start|stop}&quot;</tt></div>
<div class="line"><tt class="docutils literal">exit 1</tt></div>
<div class="line"><tt class="docutils literal">;;</tt></div>
<div class="line"><tt class="docutils literal">esac</tt></div>
<div class="line"><tt class="docutils literal">exit 0</tt></div>
</div>
<p>It all works pretty well! The only real downside is the volume: Airplay's pretty quiet. I should be able to automate the volume adjustment on the Sonos -- SoCo exposes that functionality as well, and Shairport can call scripts upon client disconnect, too, to reset the volume. But I haven't had a chance to write that yet.</p>
<p>Anyway, if folks start wandering in from Google and find this useful or desirable, let me know. I could probably make this all a bit more reusable without a ton of trouble (distributing a Raspberry Pi filesystem image might be the easiest thing, really).</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Hmm. Subsequent investigation of the Sonos's line-in level adjustment capabilities reveals that the SoCo portion of this might be unnecessary: there is indeed some capacity for adjusting amplification on the line-in. Better still, there's some sort of line-in activity detection! I think I might stick with my script anyway: I have a Sonos unit on the porch that's usually powered off; I'll probably just adjust the script's logic to pipe the line-in to it if it's activated. Still, for most users the Shairport stuff should be sufficient.</p>

                    <p>I mean, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/pie-charts-are-the-worst-2013-6">yikes</a>.</p>
<p>So look. I'm obviously no designer. And I agree that the pie charts in that blog post, which are clearly cherry-picked for maximum terribleness, are terrible.</p>
<p>But usually pie charts are fine. I'm not going to bother collecting examples that demonstrate this, because unless you've led an unusually brief or interesting life, you've seen thousands of them and understood them perfectly well.</p>
<p>But I realize this isn't going to stop you. You have been to the Seminars. You have received the Texts. You have studied the words of the Prophet Tufte, and you have concluded that they demand jihad. I'm not going to convince you otherwise.</p>
<p>I'll make my case anyway.</p>
<p>To me, pie charts are handy for conveying information about the relative components of a whole because they do so through visual cues of both area and angle. If you need to show the relative sizes of multiple wholes, you can do that by varying the pies' size! Fun times, but I suppose it's not for everyone.</p>
<p>But I would like to request that you not join the pie-haters I sometimes see advocating for <a class="reference external" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=donut+graphs&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=27C_UdPXB9Ku4AOz04GIAw&amp;ved=0CAkQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=708">donut graphs</a> or <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treemapping">treemaps</a> as alternatives. These have all of the problems of pie charts, but they throw away one of the two visual cues. (Treemaps can be useful for expressing hierarchies, and donut graphs are useful for... er. Well. Sometimes you can put a number in the middle of them!)</p>
<p>If your graph is confusing, it's probably a bad graph and you should try to make a different one. But let's not pretend that there's a Platonic Graph that we're working toward just because some dweeb in an eye-tracking lab eked out a few milliseconds' worth of statistical significance. Real graphs used for Science usually look like <a class="reference external" href="http://i2.wp.com/themonkeycage.org/static/2013/04/tweet1.png?resize=512%2C353">this</a> (to be honest, even that red line is a bit decadent). It's not great, but it gets the job done. Science is pretty much going fine despite a lot of shitty-looking graphs.</p>
<p>If you ask me (you haven't) presenting information is about tradeoffs. I don't really want to spend all day looking at things that are ugly, and that's okay. Nicely designed graphs are pleasant! People like to look at them, which is important if you want people to look at your graphs. Even if you really think pies are inefficient, you're kidding yourself if you think graphs are always purely made to shoot numerical truth into your readers' brains (when was the last time you adjusted the stroke weight on an error bar?).</p>
<p>People have varying tastes. That's a totally legitimate rationale for hating pie charts. And they're not the best choice for everything. I'm on board with that, too.</p>
<p>(Building part of your self-conception around the fanatical endorsement of the work of the one widely-known name in information design is, I would suggest, a little sillier. But whatever floats your boat. I went through a big anime phase in college, for instance.)</p>
<p>Anyway: pie charts. All I really ask is that you please shut up about them.</p>

Also, it was octagonal. These aims proved to be unrealistic. I did pull off the octagonal bit, but even that was a struggle.</p>
<p>Less fraught projects need enclosures, too, though, and I liked the technique. You can do some <a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/8002432003/">super-cool stuff</a> with lasercut materials. Like 3D printing, it removes craftsmanship as an excuse for failing to instantiate the things you imagine.</p>
<p>But although laser-cut construction allows for much stronger and prettier <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ponoko.com/make-and-sell/materials">materials</a> than 3D printing, the process of translating from two dimensions to three is trickier than you might think. There are <a class="reference external" href="http://blog.ponoko.com/2008/11/03/how-to-create-better-nodes/">various considerations</a>, from the variance of the width of the source material to the width of the path burned away by the laser (&quot;kerf&quot;). Accounting for these things in vector graphics editing programs can be quite tedious. It's easy to make mistakes.</p>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="http://capolight.wordpress.com/2011/01/22/drawing-gears-in-sketchup/">right way</a> to do this would probably be to write a plugin for Inkscape/Illustrator. But I'm more comfortable writing Python, so that's what I did. I wrote up a support class that facilitates the creation of <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finger_joint">finger-joints</a>, and which handles things like kerf automatically.</p>
<p>The output isn't designed to be ready-to-print. You should plan to import it to a vector editor and do subsequent work. Here, for example, is the output of a simple script I used for my latest project:</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/8902584803/"><img alt="fingerjoint.py output" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3690/8902584803_cae5f34b72.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: 355px;" /></a></p>
<p>And here's the EPS I constructed from it and submitted to <a class="reference external" href="http://ponoko.com">Ponoko</a>:</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/8902584869/"><img alt="fingerjoint.py output edited" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7391/8902584869_c0a202eb74.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: 332px;" /></a></p>
<p>Note the difference in the corners of the larger piece, in particular. Some editing is necessary. But the results are quite nice!</p>

<p>(ignore those laser scorch marks; I haven't pulled the adhesive paper side off yet, but when I do and flip the sides, the outside should be relatively pristine)</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/sbma44/fingerjoint">I've published the code</a>, and would love to see it expanded into a more general-purpose toolkit. Apologies for its hackiness/non-pythonicness. I assure you it's much better than the first two drafts. This version does matrix math and everything!</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>As I began this book, I was disappointed. I had picked it up after reading <a class="reference external" href="/2013/05/04/book-review-the-idea-factory/">The Idea Factory</a>, the fascinating history of Bell Labs: <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Fortunes-Formula-Scientific-Betting-Casinos/dp/0809045990/ref=sr_sp-atf_title_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1369066573&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=fortune%27s+formula">Fortune's Formula</a> was mentioned glowingly in the acknowledgements. Bell Labs employees -- including my favorite, Claude Shannon -- taking a road trip to Vegas to use their reality-bending powers of analysis to defeat the casinos? Sign me up.</p>
<p>Digging in, the danger signs began accumulating. Poundstone's prose is workmanlike at best. There are endless asides about the backgrounds of various mobsters tied to the gambling industry. And while Shannon's trips to Vegas (to beat blackjack and roulette, it turns out) are exciting and ingenious, the man was smart enough to quit once his intellectual curiosity had been satisfied. This is no <em>Bringing Down the House</em>. Vegas fades from the scene by the book's halfway point.</p>
<p>But this is where Poundstone's project becomes clear. His language loosens, his transitions from explanation to narrative become more fluid, and he starts calling people dopes. He enters his element, and embarks on the effort that excites him. Poundstone is not just fleshing out a fun Bell Labs footnote; he's telling a story about arbitrage and the modern finance industry.</p>
<p>In particular, he's telling the history of the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_criterion">Kelly Criterion</a>, an asset allocation formula -- aka betting system -- mathematically proven to maximize returns over the long run, given reinvestment of winnings and quantified odds. The story of the Kelly Criterion is interesting enough. Its foundations are rooted in Information Theory, the field Shannon singlehandedly invented, in part through the revelation that information works by reducing uncertainty -- and what is a gambler's edge if not a reduction in uncertainty? It's also fascinating to learn that despite its mathematical soundness, the Kelly Criterion apparently remains a subject of fierce debate, largely rejected by economists, finance experts and business schools thanks to a combination of practical, intellectual and cultural reasons (that it was invented by information theorists, not economists, doesn't help its cause).</p>
<p>But this book is about more than that. Poundstone mounts an implicit but still quite damning case against the modern finance industry. It's not just the slight seediness of mathematical concepts invented for roulette translating smoothly to Wall Street; it's the gangsters we were introduced to in the book's opening chapters make the trip, too, swept along by a conscious legal strategy (going legit) into a new form of gambling. By the time a young prosecutor named Rudolph Giuliani discovers he can use RICO, a law designed for the mob, to go after titans of finance, the story has become a fascinating moebius strip of money and risk. Is it a coincidence that <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_O._Thorp">Ed Thorp, the man who taught the world how to count cards</a>, is also the analytic mind behind <a class="reference external" href="http://historysquared.com/2012/01/06/performance-of-keynes-hedge-fund-chest-fund-1927-1945/comment-page-1/">one of the first and most successful hedge funds in history</a>?</p>
<p>Thorp comes out of this book looking like a singular genius, and a probably-ethical one, to boot. I'm convinced, but some suspicion is warranted -- Poundstone seems to have gotten a lot of help from him in putting this book together. Still, the man's record of returns and lack of indictments speak for themselves.</p>
<p>Aside from the Kelly Criterion and Wall Street's strange bedfellows, there are two important takeaways to be had here:</p>
<p>First, Poundstone does a number on the Efficient Market Hypothesis. I think he treats it fairly, explaining the views of its proponents, its intellectual heritage and the debates surrounding it with nuance -- like Thorp, Paul Samuelson is portrayed as a brilliant and towering figure (I'm going to have to remember <a class="reference external" href="http://anecdotage.com/articles/21631/">this trick</a> of his -- what an amazing dick move). The random walk is explained, as are investment strategies that can succeed despite the market's unpredictability. Fees and common investor mistakes are acknowledged, and he allows no confusion about what a typical investor should do: buy an index fund and ignore anyone who tells you they can beat the market.</p>
<p>Still, by the end of the book it's very hard not to conclude that a few ubermenschen walk among us -- people like Thorp -- who can consistently identify systemic pricing errors and develop ingenious ways to profit from them. The history of hedge fund tactics is explained, and of course it turns out to be built on these manipulations, from the warrant-based delta hedge to junk bonds to leveraged buyouts.</p>
<p>Before you ask: yes, Poundstone considers the survivor-bias argument at length. But I was still convinced that these techniques have worked -- at least until they're disclosed and the market begins pricing them in. EMH proponents tend to hand-wave toward this pricing-in happening with calculus-like instantaneity, but the actual history makes it clear that the process has sometimes taken months or years.</p>
<p>Second, and following from this, it's hard to read <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Fortunes-Formula-Scientific-Betting-Casinos/dp/0809045990/ref=sr_sp-atf_title_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1369066573&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=fortune%27s+formula">Fortune's Formula</a> and not conclude that finance has evolved toward (and probably past) a point of uselessness -- perhaps even destructiveness. Why does our society reward this kind of work? To provide better prices, they say, so that capital can be allocated more efficiently. The problem is that the process has no finish line. Arbitrage opportunities are discovered, profited from, and cease to exist; but Manhattan remains steadily expensive. So new arbitrage opportunities must be discovered or invented, via the sorts of exotic financial instruments that we've heard so much about these past years. But the low-hanging fruit is gone -- the margins on these deals are tiny, so they have to be amplified through incredible amounts of leverage. The complexity of the system inevitably sometimes reaches a point where interdependencies aren't fully realized -- Poundstone makes this point by narrating the epic destruction of <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-Term_Capital_Management">LTCM</a> -- and things blow up.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Fortunes-Formula-Scientific-Betting-Casinos/dp/0809045990/ref=sr_sp-atf_title_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1369066573&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=fortune%27s+formula">Fortune's Formula</a> was published in 2006. Poundstone doesn't even need the Great Recession to make his point.</p>
<p>A few caveats. I'm not a great consumer of books about finance. I haven't even read <em>The Big Short</em>. It's very possible that these insights are less novel than they seemed to me.</p>
<p>But this book taught me quite a bit of history, more than a few financial concepts, and changed the way I think about investing/gambling/risk. I'm tempted to reread it, even if just to make sure I got the thrust of the early chapters right (if I'd known who Ed Thorp would become, I would've paid a bit more attention -- I had heard the name before, but didn't make the connection).</p>
<p>Highly recommended.</p>

                    <p>I'm not sure what to think of this one. Watts rattles off a ton of counterintuitive facts about human cognition, and they're facts that I love and am fascinated by -- this is what I spent my college years studying -- but I can't help but be irritated by his recitation of them.</p>
<p>A big part of this is his prose, which is pretentious and baroque. Three uses of &quot;calcareous&quot; in a single novel might not *sound* like a lot...</p>
<p>The mechanics of what's going on are often difficult to track. This isn't so much because of the alienness of the ideas on offer, like in <em>Quantum Thief</em>. It's more that the language obscures what's going on. It's quite a contrast from <em>Rendezvous with Rama</em>, another first-contact-with-a-questionably-populated-alien-craft story. The action is overwritten, and hard to track.</p>
<p>Watts also gives himself too much credit for the quality of the ideas he's offering. The motley crew of savants that he offers seem not-that-abnormal, to be honest. The idea that a mediating &quot;jargonaut&quot; is necessary to translate their bizarre utterances into baseline-human comprehensible intelligence seems implausible (even with some minor hand-waving about this being an edited account). His characterizations are fairly thin, too -- in light of this, giving one character multiple personalities seems like a particularly poor decision.</p>
<p>The biggest problem may be how overeager he is to get to his ideas. There's a distinct refusal to self-edit -- the closing notes of the book mention that his other sci-fi series, <em>Rifters</em> is available in unabridged form on his website, and indicates some kind of disagreement with the publisher about the shorter form the printed edition took. Hmm. One can't help but wonder if the ideas about the singularity, empathy, Searle's Chinese Room, qualia zombies, evolution and vampires (sigh) should have been pared down, at least slightly (at the very least the vampires should have been tossed).</p>
<p>Still, I have to admit that the book picks up in its final third. Watts proves to have been building toward something, and it's coherent and interesting. I'm not a huge fan of the consciousness-denying hypotheses that I associate with Dan Dennett and that Watts attributes to Thomas Metzinger. But they're presented mostly coherently (though consciousness is given seriously short shrift by Watts, particularly its likely role in organizing concepts so as to make technology possible). I'm more of a mystic, or at least sufficiently guilt-riddled as to want to embrace panpsychism. But I will admit that he's making an interesting argument, even if it is cobbled together from a truly wild hodge-podge of quite-tentative research and misstatements about electromagnetism.</p>
<p>A ton of people that I know love this book, and a ton more are intrigued by these philosophical questions. If you're less bugged by the writing than I am, you might really like it. For me it was just okay, though it earns points for its ambition.</p>

                    <p>I just reread this thing for the who-knows-how-many-th time. It's still quite funny! But it's interesting to read it as an adult:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The humor is a little harder to take than it used to be, having now been exposed to long years of amiable nerds gracelessly aping the Monty Python sensibility. Douglas Adams books are clearly another transmission vector for this tendency to tediously parrot (though Adams' own execution, while inarguably derivative, is fluid and hilarious).</li>
<li>It's quite nihilistic, thought mirthfully so. I suspect this had a big influence on my own comedic preferences.</li>
<li>It's also pretty libertarian in its perspective, particularly the passage with the ruler of the universe (though I suppose that's in the next book).</li>
<li>It's thin! Adams wasn't kidding about stopping mid-stream.</li>
<li>Ben's right that <em>The Restaurant at the End of the Universe</em> is less satisfying, largely thanks to its repetition of jokes. I think things get quite a bit better further along, though, particularly in Adams' treatment of the Golgafrinchans, which is considerably more humane than the uniformly acid tone of the first book.</li>
<li>Last thought: Adams is of course mostly a humorist, but he's underrated as a stylist. Magrathea is spooky and lonely. The primeval earth is calming and lovely. England is small and homey. This talent really shines through in his nonfiction book <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Last-Chance-See-Douglas-Adams/dp/0345371984">Last Chance to See</a>, incidentally, which I recommend highly.</li>

                    <p>A really lovely history of Bell Labs and its incredible impact on the world. Gertner does a fantastic job of synthesizing existing historical accounts, while also unearthing his own wholly original findings through interviews and dives into the AT&amp;T archives.</p>
<p>I found the book particularly interesting since my job is all about managing technical staff who are trying to identify worthwhile problems and new ways of looking at them. I don't mean to compare our modest efforts to those of the people who invented the transistor, of course. But it was reassuring to have many of my engineer's intuitions about what makes for successful research environments -- adequate resources, plenty of freedom, good people, a focus on the questions themselves and a healthy tension between theory and application -- validated by the management theories captured in this book.</p>
<p>It's clear that Gertner has favorites among the cast of characters orbiting Bell Labs, but that's okay; so do I. His charming and moving account of Claude Shannon is particularly affecting, I thought. And it's hard to read this and not emerge a John Pierce fan. The treatment of Bill Shockley, by contrast, is relentlessly negative, though Gertner makes a strong case for this being wholly deserved.</p>
<p>My only other window into the Bell system is <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Master-Switch-Information-Empires/dp/0307390993/ref=sr_sp-atf_title_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1367725414&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=master+switch">Tim Wu's book</a>, which is notably unmentioned here, despite being published more than a year earlier than <em>The Idea Factory</em>. I assume this has something to do with publication lead times, something to do with Wu's book being an analysis that rehashes the same histories Gertner mined, and something to do with its less charitable perspective on AT&amp;T and its monopolistic activities. Still, an interesting omission.</p>
<p>Anyway, this is highly recommended for anyone inspired by digital technology or information theory. I think this will finally nudge me into reading the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Information-History-Theory-Flood/dp/1400096235/ref=sr_sp-atf_title_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1367725386&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=gleick">Gleick book</a> (as well as <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Fortunes-Formula-Scientific-Betting-Casinos/dp/0809045990/ref=sr_sp-atf_title_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1367725354&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=fortune%27s+formula">Fortune's Formula</a>, about Shannon's efforts to beat Vegas and the stock market -- that one, in particular sounds fantastic to me).</p>

                    <p>Beautifully written; this makes me want to read more Le Guin.</p>
<p>I wasn't bowled over by the ideas on offer. In part this is probably because this book is an innovator; others have used sci-fi to examine gender in more radical ways since, which makes this feel slightly tame.</p>
<p>But I suspect that my reaction is also in part because I'm a man. The signature implication of Gethenian physiology is that things in their culture aren't gendered. This mostly registered to me as bland ambiguity, but I can imagine that might have to do with my own gender being the default for so many things in my own culture (witness even Le Guin employing &quot;he&quot; as the pronoun used for ungendered characters).</p>
<p>But though I might have a blind spot when it comes to the novelty of the setting, I feel pretty confident in saying the plot is thin. It's driven largely by politics, but those politics are presented through a veil of intentionally alien concepts (shifgrethor, for example) that prevent the reader from feeling excited, <em>Wolf Hall</em>-style, even when very little is actually happening.</p>
<p>Inscrutable political shuffling then gives way to some heroic questing, but with an extremely spare cast of characters. That's fine for a Jack London story, but I'm not sure it works here -- particularly since Le Guin shies away from making us uncomfortable with the Ai/Estraven dynamic's final destination.</p>
<p>Basically: needed more kemmering.</p>

                    <p>Really interesting, and wins points for bothering with characterizations. I'm not sure how much sense it makes, though. In this world both food calories and fossil fuels have become massively more expensive (due to engineered plagues and depletion/climate change, respectively). But this leads to <em>more</em> of the energy economy being driven by food calories? Mastodons are not an efficient energy storage mechanism! Where are the solar panels and nukes and wind turbines and tidal power?</p>
<p>Aside from that I have three main complaints. First, the book's climax feels disjointed and loses the winning human scale of earlier action -- the characters who've been built up in earlier phases are left on the sidelines while the action moves through redshirts and cipherlike Thai generals. Second, the sexual exploitation of Emiko is porny in an unfortunate way. And third, Gibbons seems underutilized to the point where he's mostly just a Dr. Moreau throwaway.</p>
<p>The setting is pretty cool, though, and the neocolonial stakes are extreme and awesome. This is like Atwood's dystopic genomic imagination but played out through believable institutions.</p>

                    <p>People seem ready to hate Google Glass!</p>
<p>Yesterday there was the Tumblr <a class="reference external" href="http://whitemenwearinggoogleglass.tumblr.com/">White Men Wearing Google Glass</a>. This is not only slightly mystifying -- a <a class="reference external" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=google+glass&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=S7SCUcO9OZjI4APfwYDoBg&amp;ved=0CAoQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=752&amp;sei=T7SCUYmpLJK24AOsjIH4Cg">Google image search for &quot;Google Glass&quot;</a> returns what seems like a pretty diverse collection of testers and models -- but, speaking as a white man who aspires to wearing Google Glass (at least briefly), hard not to take a little bit personally. In fairness to the Tumblr's author, Robert Scoble is a faintly ridiculous person, and adding &quot;screaming&quot; and &quot;in the shower&quot; certainly does not yield a net improvement in gravitas. This is, arguably, another fitful effort to delineate a gendered subtext to Glass, a project started when Sergey Brin stupidly described smartphone use as &quot;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/27/sergey-brin-emasculating_n_2776389.html">emasculating</a>&quot; during a TED sales pitch. (I think the most plausible reading is that he intended the word to mean &quot;disempowering&quot; rather than &quot;womanly&quot;, but the charitableness of your reading may reasonably differ.)</p>
<p>This isn't the only place where people are picking sides between Team Glass and Team Glass Is Stupid And Bad. Earlier today Wired published a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.wired.com/business/2013/05/inherent-dorkiness-of-google-glass/">truly awful essay</a> by Marcus Wohlson predicting Glass's failure for different (though still Scoble-related!) reasons. It begins by erecting a geek/nerd continuum best left to Joss Whedon fan boards, goes on to a question-begging explanation of Segway's lack of success, and concludes by belittling Glass's lack of coolness -- as if coolness was an objective quality rather than something constructed collectively by people like the author himself. It's a bit mind-boggling that anyone could so thoroughly fail to see the arbitrary nature of culture. (The best reply to the Wired piece is probably <a class="reference external" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bianca-bosker/google-glass_b_2863848.html">this great post by Bianca Bosker discussing the history of eyeglass adoption</a>. But for a shortcut, the next time you see a world leader wearing a business suit, reflect on whether Europeans just happened to come up with the objectively awesomest formal attire.)</p>
<p>Watching people declare their tribal loyalties is fascinating and wearying. It's not surprising behavior, exactly: this product launch is a big, SEO-worthy cultural event, and one wouldn't want to be caught un-jaded. Certainly I don't: I've cheerfully presented from a slide deck making <a class="reference external" href="http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/35318157.jpg">dumb Dragonball Z jokes at Glass's expense</a>.</p>
<p>Nor should consumer tribalism be surprising to anyone who's read John Gruber's ongoing project to construct a theodicy of Apple, or anyone who has spoken to a teenager for thirty seconds. For people who don't enjoy getting angry about sports or religion or nationalism or politics, consumer gadgets seem to fill the void.</p>
<p>Still, in this case I can't help being irked by these reactions. I tend to emotionally align against new tech products (&quot;that's dumb/it's been done&quot;), so this might seem hypocritical.</p>
<p>But don't you have to respect the <em>ambition</em> of Glass? This is the most daring project I've seen in ages. Not just automation of an existing system of transport/food delivery/coupons. Not a privatized homage to NASA triumphs of decades past.</p>
<p>Consider what a persistent connection to the network means. Already I find myself giving up on learning certain classes of information -- why would I need to remember a friend's address or a bus schedule or a business's hours? Those parts of my mind now exist in my phone, and sure, the retrieval times are poor, but the integrity and capacity are excellent. Narrowing the latency of that interface further would be a profound change.</p>
<p>And that's to say nothing of the implications of persistent enmeshment in the conversations and status competitions of social media. You can take your strange, geographyless social universe with you on the go! On your head (if not yet in it)! You will be fully in one place even less often than you are now. If Twitter is like telepathy, Google Glass strives to be like astral projection*.</p>
<p>I suspect that humans' individual nervous and collective social systems aren't currently capable of dealing with this. Either Glass will flop or we will. For what it's worth, I think the former is pretty likely (battery or input bandwidth are where I'd place my bets) and, failing that, the latter is all but certain. But I don't really know. I am certain, though, that Glass is a wildly ambitious transhumanist project, a crazed conceptual art piece being executed on a massive scale with, mystifyingly, real engineering and industrial muscle behind it.</p>
<p>I have no idea if it'll succeed; I have no idea if I want it to succeed. But carping about its coolness is like complaining about the case color of the first A-bomb. To hell with that. Even the privacy argument about Glass strikes me as shallow.</p>
<p>The question is: what does Glass and its successors aim to turn us into? Is it something we want to become, or can become? And if it's to fail, can it please, please be for reasons more profound than fashion or lack of 4G?</p>
<p>* ask me about my <em>Doctor Strange</em>-themed trend piece pitch!</p>

                    <p>Let's find out. <a class="reference external" href="http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/books/2013/04/interview-with-a-writer-evgeny-morozov/">This interview</a> elicits a number of quibbles from me.</p>
<blockquote>
[... Y]ou never had the technology of perfection that was as available and as cheap and as ubiquitous. You never had Google Glasses before, you never had self-driving cars, you never had doors that recognise who you are and let you in.</blockquote>
<p>We still don't have two of those things; declaring them &quot;technologies of perfection&quot; seems premature. <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(lock)#History_of_locks_and_keys">Wikipedia says we've had the third technology for about four millennia</a>. &nbsp;I agree that connecting the system to Klout instead of &nbsp;human-mediated systems of status-determination is annoying, but it seems like an incremental change.</p>
<blockquote>
If [Valley royalty with political ambitions] join the Democrats or the Republicans, then it would be very boring. If some of them decide to go and resurrect the democracy movement, then that would be very exciting to write about.</blockquote>
<p>It was initially a bit gobsmacking to see a critic of Silicon Valley's political naivete declare that an tech-led attempt to create a third party would be &quot;very exciting to write about.&quot; But perhaps he finds this exciting in the same sense that a hunter looks forward to a deer wandering into a meadow.</p>
<blockquote>
In America, you need to drive and you need to drive more and more</blockquote>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/04/22/why-arent-younger-americans-driving-anymore/">Vehicle miles traveled is declining</a>, and the global trend is toward urbanization. But his point about the potential effect of self-driving cars on the commuting equilibrium is well-taken.</p>
</li><!--  -->
<blockquote>
As drones get cheaper and 3D printers get cheaper, all that can be done in a very different manner. And there will be huge implications for mobility from 3D printers, which again some people don’t expect.</blockquote>
<p>3D printers are mostly good for producing alternatives to injection-molded plastic and, to a lesser extent, ceramic and metal, in applications where price and the strength of the material are not important considerations. Looking around my desk, the items that could plausibly be produced by 3D printer -- without an expert to assemble other pieces, at which point the automation rationale falls apart -- include a coffee scoop, a pencil case, and a few collectible figurines. And I assure you that my desk is extremely messy.</p>
<p>Products like this are mostly imported and cost basically nothing, and consequently there's not going to be a ton of capital available to build a huge same-day iPhone case-manufacturing infrastructure. Yes, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/11/30/tech/innovation/staples-3-d-printing">Staples is going to offer in-store 3D printing</a>, and yes, I am pretty excited about it for hobbyist reasons. But it's going to be a niche. This technology will continue to have a growing impact on industrial design (where it's been in use for decades), fabrication of bespoke objects like running shoes and medical implants, and might make some consumer goods slightly more feasibly repairable. But I think people are confusing &quot;how super-cool is this technology?&quot; with &quot;how likely is this technology to change how we live and work?&quot; Seriously, go give <a class="reference external" href="http://www.thingiverse.com/">Thingiverse</a> a good look. It's lovely work, and some of it would be quite handy (albeit wildly expensive compared to existing injection-molded or stamped alternatives). But not that much of it.</p>
<p>Most useful objects are made of multiple materials, and 3D printing is not yet very good at that kind of fabrication. Perhaps it will grow to be! In the meantime, I suggest that optimists try pricing a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tn0EKtLOVx4">pick-and-place machine</a>, then imagine what it might cost to buy one that works in three dimensions. My next pair of sneakers could be 3D printed; parts of my next bicycle probably will be; my next kneecap <em>certainly</em> ought to be. But this is a tiny fraction of the manufactured world.</p>
