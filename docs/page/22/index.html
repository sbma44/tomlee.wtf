                    <p>The fact that the Wombats haven't yet become a hugely successful band is a persistent puzzlement for me. I've been patient! Ever since the first version of &quot;Backfire at the Disco&quot; I've bided my time, waiting for stateside tour dates and a favorable Pitchfork review. I thought that a much-touted SXSW showcase would do it, but no — I'm still waiting. In the meantime the band has released a number of increasingly overproduced (but still catchy!) singles, and seems to be prepping a new LP.</p>
<p>They also signed with Roadrunner Records, whose <a class="reference external" href="http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/artists/">artists page</a> is hilarious enough that you really ought to visit it. It's filled with doughy, dour-looking gentleman who front bands with names like Dragonforce and DevilDriver and Nickelback, and who never, ever smile. It is probably the worst collection of bands you've ever seen — except for that one trio of little British fellas, who write catchy pop songs that are smart and fun and pretty much everything you'd want from a cheeky Liverpudlian trio. Bah! Anyway, if you can find <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Girls-Boys-Marsupials-Wombats/dp/B000GMBQ5U/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&amp;s=music&amp;qid=1235160247&amp;sr=8-5">this album</a> at a non-exorbitant price, you should really think about getting it.</p>

                    <p>I'm at the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.dccourts.gov/dccourts/about/general.jsp">Moultrie Courthouse</a> today, fulfilling my civic duty. It's not too bad. So far I'd say the experience is somewhat more entertaining than <a class="reference external" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113500/">Jury Duty</a> (starring Pauly Shore), but probably somewhat less entertaining than <a class="reference external" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0993818/fullcredits#cast">&quot;Jury Duty&quot;</a>, an apparently still-running series in which luminaries liek Bruce Vilanch, Kevin Sorbo and Vanessa from <em>The Cosby Show</em> sit in judgment of ordinary Americans.</p>
<p>The worst part about all this is the lack of novelty: the DC internet community has been decimated by a wave of jury summonses over the past few months, totally undermining the anecdotal value of this experience. On the other hand, it's not like there's a ton of things to do as I sit here, waiting to be told to go sit somewhere else. Hence this blog post.</p>
<p>I was called into voire dire for a murder trial in a courtroom that had seemingly been designed by the same firm that built our nation's system of bowling alleys (it will apparently soon be renovated to look more like a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.gruzensamton.com/pop_project_all.asp?BuildingCode=&amp;image=1&amp;id=138#">cheesy starship set</a>). Things went pretty smoothly: I even managed not to crack up when the judge claimed that the crime occurred in a neighborhood called &quot;Turkeyneck&quot;.</p>
<p>I wasn't removed during the initial round of juror elimination. I think I have to attribute this to my corduroy jacket: to prosecutors a jacket says that I'm rich enough to have no way to relate to the probably-poor defendant, while the defense sees its waling and immediately knows I'm beset by liberal guilt.</p>
<p>My obvious desirability as a juror (says the 29 year-old with the Xbox Live account) had me a little worried, in fact. I politely explained to the judge that actually I'd rather not spend all next week away from email and/or dealing with weighty moral issues; amazingly, he actually acceded, putting me near the bottom of the line of folks that gradually snaked its way into the jury box. And, sure enough, the court managed to find a full allotment of dutiful citizens/suckers before I was needed.</p>
<p>I'm back in the jurors' lounge now, and my name has already been called again, but there's apparently some question as to whether I'll be needed. I certainly wouldn't mind being excused: I'm a little wiped out. Having been informed by others that the courthouse had wifi, I'd sort of assumed that coffee would also be available — that's how Maslow's Hierarchy of White Collar Needs works, isn't it? Sadly, this has not proven to be the case, and the other caffeine I've got in me came from some weak lunchtime tea at Chinatown Express. Here's hoping I get to go home soon, or at least that the next trial is about something sufficiently unimportant that my sleepy incompetence will be forgivable.</p>

Remember how I <a class="reference external" href="/2008/12/16/music-in-the-year-of-the-rat/">bitched about 2008's crop of music</a>? And how I closed by saying &quot;but there are a bunch of things I haven't listened to; maybe they'll be better&quot;? Well, I listened to a few of them, and they've all been fantastic. Here are some albums I should've paid attention to earlier, and a few that I've been paying attention to recently:</p>
<p>No Age (too cool for skool, but in a pleasant way); Glasvegas (awesomely overwhelming, and prompted me to finally listen to <em>Lust Lust Lust</em> for a full-on fuzz-fest); Gaslight Anthem (actually as good as Spencer says); Titus Andronicus (wears thin by the end, but awfully energetic). And as I mentioned, the new Dan Deacon has leaked and is fantastic — better than <em>Spiderman of the Rings</em>, I think. Although I should preface this observation by noting that my knowledge of classical music is more or less limited to the soundtrack for Beef Council commercials, I will go so far as to say that <em>Bromst</em> sounds Coplandesque to me in a lot of places.</p>
<p>Oh! Also, Julian says that Pains of Being Pure at Heart are good, and the couple of songs I heard at his place bore that judgment out.</p>
<p>Not recommended: Andrew Bird, Animal Collective. Neither are bad (although Bird's a bit boring, which is disappointing given how wowed I've been by the handful of live TV performances of his that I've seen), but neither really did it for me, either. Admittedly, my lukewarm feelings for the AC album may have something to do with the displaced rage that its title elicits.</p>
<p><strong>OH YEAH:</strong> Speaking of music, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/148739-guest-list-diplo">this Diplo interview</a> is pretty funny.</p>

                    <p>Well, as of yesterday I'm twenty-nine. It's terrible! Or in theory it is, anyway. I actually had an extremely nice weekend: Emily came down from Philly; we ate at Corduroy; cooked a delicious Valentine's Day meal with Matt and Sara; saw <em>The Wrestler</em>; had Szechuan hot pot with Ezra, Annie, Ethan, Kay, Ben and Amanda, and then went out for drinks with folks on Sunday. Aside from a minor fiasco involving finding a bar that wasn't so packed as to be unusable — seriously, space in DC drinking establishments is now at such a premium that booking a band has to be considered a hostile act perpetrated against the patrontariat — it was a great way to spend a birthday. Oh! And along the way I got an <a class="reference external" href="https://buy.garmin.com/shop/shop.do?pID=349">exciting new electronic fitness</a> gizmo, a book about werewolves and some custom-made oatmeal. Not too shabby.</p>
<p>At the moment I'm sitting at home, <a class="reference external" href="http://flickr.com/photos/sbma44/3284658377/">preparing</a> for an <a class="reference external" href="http://dclug.tux.org/dclug_meetings.html">Arduino-related presentation</a> I'll be contributing to [STRIKEOUT:tomorrow] on Wednesday (not the one with Alberto; that's on the 28th), listening to <a class="reference external" href="http://moraladventure.blogspot.com/2009/02/world-dances-on-dd.html">the new Dan Deacon</a> (which is beautiful) and playing <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance_Wars_Dual_Strike">Advance Wars</a>. It's pretty pleasant! But it also seems like the sort of opportunity I ought to use for writing things here.</p>
<p>I've been terrible about this, I realize. I also realize that blogged resolutions to change are stupid. But in my experience it's only possible to maintain (relative) prolificacy if I force myself into the habit — after that first push things get easier. Besides, it was mostly the process of becoming oriented to my new gig over at Sunlight that's left me too busy and distracted to do much else. But I've got some help now, and things have calmed down a bit, so yeah: blogging!</p>
<p>So, uh... I guess that still leaves this post a little low on content, huh? Hmm. Has everyone already seen that <em>I'm on a Boat (ft. T-Pain)</em> video?</p>
<p>What can I say? I'm a sucker for profanity and pashmina jokes. And, totally coincidentally, I've recently been aspiring to boat-ridership myself. It's the perfect YouTube storm.</p>
<p>Oh! Also funny: <a class="reference external" href="http://www.avclub.com/articles/eugene-mirman-answers-your-questions-about-sex-lif,23762/">Eugene Mirman</a>. There, that's enough other-people's-content, right? See, I told you I'd be able to get back into the blogging swing of things.</p>

                    <p>I'm a day late, but still want to congratulate the folks at EchoDitto and the MJ web team for successfully launching the new <a class="reference external" href="http://www.motherjones.com">Mother Jones.com</a>. I worked on the new MoJo site for my last few months at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.echoditto.com">EchoDitto</a>, and leaving the project incomplete was one of the major qualms I had about leaving — I got to work with a lot of cool clients at ED, but it's hard to think of one I was happier about than Mother Jones. I know it's been an at-times painful process (it always is), but it's great to see what I left behind turned into the new site.</p>

                    <p>While the wort was boiling I put together a couple more Boarduino kits that I had hanging around, and tonight I messed around with them a bit more. I already had the breadboard set up with the shift registers and LEDs — not that you can see them, of course (thanks YouTube!).</p>
<p>Tonight I made a pinwheel, then hooked it up to a DC motor and used the combination as a more expensive, less accurate, potentially chip-destroying rotary encoder. It's pretty janky, in other words. But I had this motor on hand (scrounged it from a CDROM), and Radioshack doesn't stock rotary encoders. Besides, some safety checking with the multimeter implies that it'd have to be a <em>very</em> strong wind to fry the chip.</p>
<p>Anyway, all of this was in service of Summer Camp, a series of talks and events at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.transformergallery.org/">Transformer</a> that launched this Saturday and which will be going on through the first week of March. Marissa was kind enough to invite me to talk about the Arduino, and <a class="reference external" href="http://selforganizingsystem.org/">Alberto</a> is generously sharing a stage with me, which I find pretty exciting.

One side shouts: &quot;It's outrageous! It's unprecedented! In terms of economic and political theory, it's odious!&quot; The other replies that yes, you're right about all of that, but if we do nothing the alternative will probably be worse. We've already tried all of the less objectionable things that we normally do, but now we're out of alternatives and so the only options we have left are nationalizing banks or giving handouts to financiers or, god forbid, cleaning up the National Mall so that our great American commons isn't a disgusting barren mudpit.</p>
<p>So yes, it's a bad situation, but a lack of ideas seems to be at least part of the problem. And then last night it struck me: a bold, novel solution, which I offer here in the humble spirit of citizenship.</p>
<p>We need more money flowing around, right? But we can't just print more money because of the inflationary risk, right? It has to be short term — new money that disappears after a while. The answer is simple: chocolate gelt. Edible currency. Fiat finger food! It'll circulate for a while, then gradually disappear as people consume it. For those of you who still believe in economics, I think the technical rationale is that the currency will be consumed once its marginal deliciousness (or whatever) exceeds its face value. Personally, I think it'll probably just be consumed by the drunk, hungry or drunk &amp; hungry. Either way, there's a built-in safety check against long-term inflationary effects.</p>
<p>There are of course some practical concerns. The foil would have to be significantly upgraded to make regular handling of the currency viable — perhaps some sort of carefully engineered tin design would be necessary. Also, it may be that chocolate is too cheap (or melting-prone) a commodity to turn into a useful form of currency. Or perhaps forgers would refill empties with Hershey's chocolate — presumably inferior to delicious federal chocolate. But there are solutions to these problems. Maybe we could use ampules of liquor. Or, simpler still, the government could storm Hidden Valley, seize its ranch-producing operations and make the Treasury Department the only source of our precious national condiment.</p>
<p>Whatever the specifics, I think this is an initiative that would be welcomed by the public. Certainly I'd be a lot happier about it than I was when I received five one-dollar coins' worth of change from the Chinatown bus people last night.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>I'm now hopelessly late with this, so I'll try (and fail) to make it brief. On Friday <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ryanavent.com/blog/?p=1755">Ryan discussed D.C.'s ban on overhead &quot;catenary&quot; wires</a>, which would be necessary for electric streetcars. Apparently you can't use an electrified sunken rail in cities that have to salt their roads — there are corrosion issues. Unfortunately, changing the law to allow overhead wires would require congressional involvement. Ryan mentions a company that's pushing a technology providing for the wireless transfer of power from the street to the streetcar, allowing the system to be sealed and immune to salt. It sounds like a pretty clever solution. But that doesn't make it a good one.</p>
<p>Like a transformer, this technology works through induction, converting electricity to magnetism and back again. In a normal transformer you have a core of some sort — picture an iron ring — and you've got two wires, one for input and one for output. These get wrapped around the core like in <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Transformer3d_col3.svg">this picture</a>. Send alternating current into the input wire and its wrappings will generate a magnetic field, which will be conducted along the core, which will excite electrons in the other wire's coils and generate an output current. If you change the ratio of windings on the input and output coils the voltage will change, too, which is a very useful thing to be able to do. As you might imagine, transforming energy from one form to another in this way isn't perfectly efficient (although in large, well-designed units it can be very close to it). Some electricity is lost to heat, which is why those heavy old wall-wart adapters — heavy thanks to their iron cores — tend to be warm to the touch after they've been plugged in for a while.</p>
<p>Newer &quot;switchmode&quot; adapters use a different technique for changing voltage levels. This method doesn't require an iron core, which is why they can be so much lighter and smaller. Strictly speaking, transformers don't need the iron core, either. The problem is that they're much less efficient without one — which brings us to inductive power transfer and the streetcars. In this case one coil is sitting in the street and one's sitting in the streetcar. The core, such as it is, is made of air, which is terrible at guiding magnetic fields, and gets ever-more terrible the further apart the coils are — this is not a useful technique for moving power anything but very short distances.</p>
<p>The point of all this is that you're going to be wasting energy if you try to move it around wirelessly. Worse, it's going to be more expensive to build the system to do all this than it would be to just make the connection with wires. It's not as if inductive charging hasn't been tried in the marketplace: some early electric cars used inductive paddles to charge, and various efforts are <a class="reference external" href="http://www.dansdata.com/danletters150.htm">intermittently made</a> to provide magical laptop-charging desks. But aside from electric toothbrushes — which, as the previous link notes, can afford to waste some energy if it lets them stay watertight — there just aren't that many applications where choosing a more expensive, more wasteful way of transmitting energy makes sense.</p>
<p>And I have a feeling that the same will prove to be true of streetcars. Wikipedia <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_energy_transfer#Resonant_induction">cites</a> an 80% efficiency number from an experimental bus system developed in 1990. That was a while ago, but it's hard for me to imagine that the situation has gotten that much better — or that real-world applications could match the performance of a system in a closed test track. It's going to cost more money than catenary wires, and you won't be able to get your coils very close together on hilly streets, so your electricity bill is going to be 10% or 20% more than it would if you used direct conduction. It would be a shame to let an accident of bureaucratic history make this engineering choice.</p>

                    <p>As I mentioned, I've been working overtime to hit a deadline — that sort of thing comes up when you suddenly get word that <a class="reference external" href="http://www.npr.org/templates/rundowns/rundown.php?prgId=3">Steve Inskeep</a> is going to start mentioning your URL. Having my laptop suffer a catastrophic logic board failure on Tuesday afternoon didn't help matters.</p>
<p>But we got the site up, and if you're interested in checking it out you can do so at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.subsidyscope.com">subsidyscope.com</a>. You might've already seen the earlier version of the site. This update was to get things beyond the brochureware stage, and to put some actual data online. We were under the gun, and consequently didn't get to do as much as we'd like, or in the way we'd like — witness my ugly inline CSS. But we'll be adding to the site and fixing those problems in the near future.</p>
<p>Thanks to the unexpected end of the American economy, we've shifted gears somewhat and are focusing our early attention on the federal bailout of the financial and automotive sectors rather than examining the even more formidable problem of energy subsidies. Don't worry — we'll still be getting to energy, and transportation, and a bunch of other sectors. But we felt that a project focusing on subsidies couldn't just ignore one of the largest economic interventions of all time.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, data on the bailout is still pretty hard to come by. Despite the congressional complaints you may have heard regarding its transparency, the TARP program is actually the best-characterized part of the bailout of any substantial size — and hey, I made a fancy Javascript visualization thingy for it! But TARP is a relatively small part of the bailout. Part of the problem is that the agencies handing out money haven't released information about what they're doing, either because doing so would violate the privacy of the institutions receiving funds (something that many would call a pretty lame excuse — FOIAs and lawsuits are in process); or simply because they have no idea how much money they've handed out: in a lot of cases the government's promised to cover someone's horrible screw-up, but the bill for the screw-up hasn't yet arrived.</p>
<p>A big part of our job will be to chart and revise the estimates of those costs — and, in particular, to establish how much of the government's payments are subsidies, rather than just market-rate loans being made because everyone else is too scared to lend.</p>
<p>Technically, I've gotten to do a lot of fun stuff. I'm still hopelessly amateurish at Django, but I'm starting to really appreciate Python. Django's pretty handy, too, although I can already see why I've heard others complain about the relatively limited nature of its template system (when unmodified, anyway). I was in a hurry to get the visualizations done — there were a number that got scrapped prior to launch, unfortunately — and settled on <a class="reference external" href="http:/raphaeljs.com">Raphael JS</a> a bit earlier than I should have. As it turns out, its IE performance is not great. But I was mostly pleased with it, and of course jQuery remains very pleasant to work with. I'm working to port the TARP visualization into Flash anyway, though (via the Flex framework) — IE's performance is just too lousy to stick with Javascript.</p>

                    <p>I was pretty happy to wake up and see snowflakes falling. I'd already decided to take the day off — a tight deadline had forced me to work an extra week's worth of evenings, plus Saturday and Sunday — so I was committed to sloth irrespective of the weather. Having snow on the ground somehow made the experience of playing hooky seem more legitimate, though, and consequently more restful.</p>
<p>Washingtonians famously tend to freak out about snow. In truth, I think we only do so to the extent necessary to support a more important (and collectively beloved) winter weather meta-activity: complaining about how much everyone else freaks out about snow. I remember Don &amp; Mike doing bits about residents stockpiling bread, milk and toiletpaper as early as their WAVA days, back when the station focused on engendering affection for C&amp;C Music Factory rather than for Jesus. Sure, I believe that area residents don't really know how to drive in winter conditions. But for me and for most other folks around here that belief is much less dearly-held than the broader sentiment that, once flakes start falling, everyone else becomes an idiot.</p>
<p>Whatever the underlying motivation, I'm glad that we overreact to snow, sleet, slush, hail, wintry mix and of course the dread black ice. This city works too hard. It would be nice if we'd drop the rationalizations and simply acknowledge our snow-induced delays as acquiescences to the pagan meteorological gods. Divine injunctions to take it easy are too few and far between. I say that for anything over two inches we officially take the day off. Not because it's hard to get around, but just because. If any tourists look at you askance just mumble something about averting wrath.</p>

                    <p>Given that I'm a Professional Internet Guy, it's probably not wise for me to spend as much time as I do telling people that the web is less important than they think. But guys, seriously: the web is less important than you think — especially the new administration's use of the web.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.kottke.org/09/01/the-countrys-new-robotstxt-file">Kottke's analysis of the new robots.txt file at whitehouse.gov</a> is the latest and most ludicrous example of our collective fascination with everything the Obama team does online. When placed on a webserver, a robots.txt file determines what sections of a website are ignored by search engines and other services that employ web crawling scripts. The Bush administration had a lengthy robots.txt file; the Obama administration does not. When someone bothers to point this out, they're trying to imply that Obama will be less secretive than Bush. It's a cute point to make, but c'mon — are we really supposed to believe that this means something? Does that mean, then, that the Obama administration's <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_ETag">ETag</a>-enabled HTTP headers signal its commitment to energy conservation? Does the administration's use of Microsoft IIS prove that the Obama campaign's embrace of open source technologies was meaningless? No and no. It's just a goddamn website. The president is obviously not involved in these sorts of mundane engineering decisions; but more broadly, it's almost always a mistake to look for symbolism in such decisions.</p>
<p>Of course, I doubt that Kottke would claim to be making a serious point. In this regard, the online reaction to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.change.gov">change.gov</a> was much sillier. As that site launched and evolved, I saw a lot of folks expressing sentiments like this: &quot;Look how high issue X has been voted on change.gov! In the age of the web, how long can politicians afford to ignore the will of the people?!&quot;</p>
<p>When it comes to change.gov, the answer to this question is pretty clearly &quot;indefinitely&quot;. Seriously: does anyone really think something was accomplished by voting marijuana legalization into the third-most-popular spot? That lots of people would like to smoke weed legally and are willing to say so — so long as saying it costs them no time, money or liberty — that's not exactly a direct-democratic revelation. Nor does it represent some sort of wisdom-of-crowds, well-informed policy prescription that deserves respect. I'm in favor of marijuana legalization, but the idea that the expression of this preference on change.gov is worthy of political attention is laughable.</p>
<p>Here's the thing: the executive branch is pretty important, and it has been for a while. For this reason, various institutions supporting the interchange of information between the presidency and the public have evolved, from the White House Press Corps to the Gallup poll to, um, the legislative branch. This process actually works pretty well — it's not as if the president finds himself scratching his head, saying, &quot;Gosh, I wonder what would be popular with the public?&quot; The additional information-lubrication that technology can bring to bear on this problem will offer very slight benefits.</p>
<p>Now of course, you can say that the will of the people isn't sufficiently respected by our political institutions. But representing public opinion online isn't going to make it magically attract any more official notice than it does in other formats. In fact, decreasing the cost of expressions of policy preference arguably serves to <em>reduce</em> the attention they receive. Consider how much value congressional offices place on phone calls versus paper mail or email. A hint: the harder and less form-letter-ready the medium, the more likely the staffer/glorified-CSR you deal with will be to make a tic mark on your behalf in the office tally for HR-whatever. How much attention do you think your opinion is going to garner when you give voice to it by clicking on an AJAX thumbs-up button? How much do you think it <em>deserves</em>?</p>
<p>I'll go further: to whatever extent the Obama administration <strong>is</strong> paying attention to change.gov, they're making a mistake. I mean, look, it's a nice idea. But if it's anything other than a cynical PR exercise, it's also a basically undemocratic empowerment of a particular constituency on the basis of the arbitrary criterion of Web 2.0-iness — which is admittedly better than gender or skin color, but still. <a class="reference external" href="http://techdirt.com/articles/20080423/220819935.shtml">I thought this rankled when Comcast did it on Twitter</a>, and I think it does here, too — although not as much, since the web is less of a niche forum than Twitter (and despite &quot;what to do about Iraq?&quot; probably being a more important question than &quot;why aren't my HD channels working?&quot;).</p>
<p>The one genuinely noteworthy aspect of all this online business is the direct line of communication it provides from the president to the public. Again, the import of this has been overstated: for all of its shortcomings, in most cases the media's coverage of the administration will be more useful to the public than the administration's presentation of itself. In the same way that you might visit the Toyota website when shopping for a car but give greater consideration to more disinterested sources of information like Consumer Reports, there's only so much attention that the public will — or should — pay to what the administration has to say for itself. The one big exception to this is the not-infrequent case where the media's market-determined forms preclude the efficient communication of information to the public, as when a nuanced sentiment from a speech is reduced to a sound bite. The president's online presence can offer a solution to this problem, achieving the (relatively few) advantages of a state media organ without any of the market- and opinion-distorting downsides.</p>
<p>But again: let's not overstate things. It's great that this capability exists; it's great that whitehouse.gov has gotten a new coat of paint. But these capabilities <em>have</em> existed for a while now, and nobody's given a shit. The president's weekly radio address has been on iTunes <a class="reference external" href="http://macdailynews.com/index.php/weblog/comments/6556/P100/">since 2005</a> — how often have you found yourself listening to it at the gym? It's naive to think that the internet is going to supplant all the existing ways we have for the government to listen to the public; and it's silly to think that the public is going to remain keenly interested in what the government has to say just because Obama's hired someone who knows CSS. This is all useful stuff, but it's not going to revolutionize our society.</p>
<p>The web is great and I'm glad our institutions are getting online. And the internet is changing — and already has changed — politics. But the real revolution here lies in the ways that technology makes it easier for people to organize into groups — groups that can then make their members' opinions heard through the traditional levers we have for affecting our government. Don't let me dissuade anyone from signing the urgent online petitions in their inboxes. But — so far, at least — all of the online attempts to completely disintermediate our democracy have been hopeless — even when they haven't also been hopelessly lame.</p>

                    <p>I didn't go downtown this morning. Getting anywhere even potentially worth being seemed to require a very early start, and although <a class="reference external" href="http://www.unfogged.com">Becks</a>' promise of a delicious pre-inaugural spread was tempting, I opted out. I'd gotten up before dawn the day before in order to catch a flight, making me even less inclined than normal to wake up early. Instead I woke up around 10, made some coffee and french toast, then plopped down in front of the TV. Honestly, I think this was the way to go.</p>
<p>I did head out on my bike around 1, though, to see what things were like around town. I made a rough circle down to Chinatown, over to Freedom Plaza, up Fourteenth, across U, then back down Eleventh. The verdict: there are a lot of people here! They all seem excited to bustle about and enjoy the historic occasion, but there's no comparison to <a class="reference external" href="/2008/11/05/between-the-click-of-the-light-and-the-start-of-the-dream/">the emotion that flooded the streets on election night</a>. I guess for that sort of joyousness to spread to the daylight hours we'd need to be transitioning from an even worse president than Bush to an even more trailblazing and exciting one than Obama. Like, say, a resurrected Freddie Mercury succeeding a two-term Palpatine administration. Well, fingers crossed!</p>
<p>You'll be glad to know that I took some crappy pictures with my iphone:</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/3213516732/"><img alt="water damage rOBAMAration service" class="center" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3108/3213516732_c66c13977a.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: 375px;" /></a></p>
<p>Gallery Place was ground zero for nonsensical Obama paraphernalia, including this plumber's truck with photos of the new president plastered on it. Despite the street being closed, a cop yelled at me for stopping my bike to take this photo, and then again when I took five seconds to begin moving. Ah, officiousness.</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/3212671461/"><img alt="Fourteenth Street" class="center" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3425/3212671461_2b8f635c78.jpg" style="width: 375px; height: 500px;" /></a></p>
<p>Fourteenth had stalls set up, but aside from folks queued to get into the perimeter around the mall, it wasn't too flooded with people. It was pretty fun to bike through the closed streets.</p>
<p>There's an Obama ice sculpture outside of Ben's. And yeah, the line still goes down the alley:</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/3212636453/"><img alt="Obama ice sculpture outside of Ben's" class="center" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3308/3212636453_0df63ec757.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: 375px;" /></a></p>
<p>MOST EXCITINGLY: I'm pretty sure I saw Matthew Lesko walking down my street as I returned home. I mean, okay, it could have been someone else. But whoever it was, he was wearing a leather jacket emblazoned with question marks, pants with question marks on the back pocket, a question mark hat, and ludicrous shoes (which seem likely to have also involved punctuation symbols of one sort or another).</p>

It's pretty pathetic; I should really just buy one. Thing is, when they first went on sale I thought I'd be going on the strength of EchoDitto's allotment of sponsor tickets. These days I don't use Drupal on a day to day basis, and it would be hard for me to justify attending the convention for more than a panel or two — not when I could be working. Given that, even though the organizers (<a class="reference external" href="http://developmentseed.org/">hi guys</a>!) have done a great job of keeping the price down, $250 is a bit steep for a couple of hours' instruction in technologies that aren't immediately useful to me.</p>
<p>Hence the swathing in swag. One way or another I'll be participating in the festivities — so far as I know, convention badges won't be required for hanging out at bars at the end of each day. But I'm not sure I'll actually be at the panels.</p>

                    <p>Non-surprise!: dental insurance remains a complete and utter scam. I'm still waiting on the follow-up phone call, but some mail I got over the weekend has made me think that, for the second time in six months, my dental insurer has decided they aren't responsible for paying for more than a thousand dollars' worth of work that, before the procedure, my dentist assured me they would.</p>
<p>Last time it was because they only pay for dental technologies that are no longer in use — trepanning, internally-administered quicksilver, that sort of thing. This time the procedure was safely archaic — no joke, my molar is now filled with a <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gutta_percha">tree sap discovered in 1842</a> — so I suspect that instead they'll say they're off the hook because I was switching jobs. In fact I was <em>doubly covered</em> for much of the period in question, with two — two! — separate insurance providers supposedly responsible for the care and upkeep of my mouth. There was no point at which I did not have dental coverage. I was awash in dental coverage! And yet...</p>
<p>It turns out that while an individual dental procedure occupies an infinite amount of time when viewed through the lens of subjective experience, when the perspective is shifted to the realm of paperwork even vast swaths of appointments suddenly collapse into single instantaneous points, which are located such that entropy/out-of-pocket-expenses are maximized.</p>
<p>Anyway it's all quite fascinating in a mathematical and ontological sense, but at the same time it's also really goddamn irritating.</p>

                    <p>I've been watching the SoapBlox saga, and its coverage, with morbid fascination — my interest and the vehemence of my reaction to it all are probably a sign of the increasingly provincial nature of my expertise, I suppose, and that's a little depressing. But still, I feel compelled to point out that most of the reaction to it is idiotic.</p>
<p>Here's the story: DailyKos runs on a system called Scoop. It's kind of a monstrosity, but large swaths of the netroots are used to it, terrified of change, and have consequently convinced themselves that the system they started using first happens to be technically superior to all the ones they encountered thereafter. This isn't a novel delusion by any means; most of us do it all the time, myself included.</p>
<p>One developer decided there were some things he didn't like about Scoop and elected to rewrite it in a different language. You can find the project announcement <a class="reference external" href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2005/3/27/61120/4863">here</a>, and it should immediately set off warning bells:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">There's no indication that he's envisioning his efforts as an open source project.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">He clearly hasn't bothered to learn much about Scoop, given that he misidentifies the language it's written in as PHP rather than Perl. If he'd opened a single source file, he could not have made this mistake.</p>
</li>
<li><div class="first line-block">
<div class="line">He said this:</div>
</div>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">I am not a language snob. I know all languages have their place. And I see php as the language for a small to medium sized operation. Java is an Enterprise solution and a complete, robust language, capable of interacting with just about anything computer.</div>
<div class="line">If we want to take blogs to the next level, we have to take our blogging software to the next level.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">This is the kind of meaningless bullshit that salespeople say when they know nothing about anything except that they have something written in Java that they'd like to sell. Java's great, it's fine, but PHP powers sites like Digg and Facebook, so don't tell me it can't run your blog about Rhode Island politics. Perl, can, too — obviously it powers dKos and other Scoop sites, but it also manages to keep Slashdot afloat. It's not the loveliest language around, and aside from Scoop and Movable Type, web development has pretty much moved on to faster and/or cleaner languages. But it can clearly get the job done.</div>
<div class="line">Also: &quot;capable of interacting with just about anything computer&quot;? What does that even mean?</div>
</div>
</li>
<li><p class="first">His email address is <em>pacified69&#64;yahoo.com</em>. Come on.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite this, the sorry state of Scoop hosting and the netroot throngs in its thrall seem to have been enough to push jScoop to some success as a proprietary host for political communities. The hosted effort was branded as SoapBlox, it acquired a few machines, and it charged reasonable rates. Then it got hacked.</p>
<p>I haven't seen the code; it's not open source. And it's been years since I wrote any Java, so I might not be able to make heads or tails of it even if I did see it. But my guess is that the author didn't just reinvent the wheel in terms of Scoop, but also in terms of forms processing, sanitizing input, session handling and who knows what else. Some vulnerability was left exposed, and someone took advantage of it.</p>
<p>Hey, we all make mistakes. Bugs happen. But it's our responsibility to make sure that our mistakes happen in places that are unlikely to lead to catastrophic problems. That means building on other people's work. Googling for existing projects and reading old mailing list archives is less fun than firing up TextMate and starting to type, but you've just gotta grit your teeth and do it.</p>
<p>One of SoapBlox's servers went offline, and the dev abruptly declared defeat. The users were understandably freaked out. Unfortunately, that's leading them to make some bad judgments. Here, from a Kos diary entitled &quot;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2009/1/7/121323/7371/193/681191">Why SoapBlox Matters</a>&quot;:</p>
<blockquote>
SoapBlox includes all the major features of a community blog -- namely, user diaries and other community-building features. These features are NOT readily available in any other software platform WordPress, MoveableType and others make it exceedingly difficult to do things like diaries and frontpage promotions, and SoapBlox makes it easy.</blockquote>
<p>This just isn't true. There are plenty of projects that can match the requirements of SoapBlox's users. I've used Drupal a lot, and can say with confidence that it offers the diary, threaded-commenting, rating, voting and front-page-promotion features that seem to be at the heart of Scoop. And hey, <a class="reference external" href="http://scoop.kuro5hin.org/comments/2006/6/1/41757/36255/9#9">this guy seems to like it</a>. SoapBlox doesn't matter because of its software; it matters because of the bloggers and diarists that use it. Writing blog software is much, much easier than running a successful online political community. There's plenty of software out there, and the SoapBlox community ought to set its priorities accordingly.</p>
<p>Right now parts of the netroots are rallying around SoapBlox, trying to get it back online in a sustainable way. This speaks well of them, but it's a mistake. This one-off of a project should never have been trusted with anything worth saving. Who knows what other exploits lurk in its codebase? Or what business problems might take it offline in the future? You can say that opensourcing the project will help resolve these problems, but that's only true if you can also find developer manpower willing to continue reinventing this particular wheel. Frankly, you're not going to find high-quality talent that's willing to donate its time to a cause this pointless.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.techpresident.com/blog/entry/33526/soapblox_burnout_points_to_vulnerability_in_left_s_infrastructure">TechPresident suggests another path</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
Options now for SoapBlox include [...] wrapping the platform into the services offered by one of the bigger progressive tech firms like Blue State Digital, EchoDitto, or Advomatic.</blockquote>
<p>Speaking as a someone who until recently worked at EchoDitto, and whose boss is now one of Blue State's founders, this is also a stupid idea. If one of these firms wants to do this work for free, then sure, the SoapBlox bloggers should jump at the chance. But hiring a consultancy is an option that's vastly more expensive than what's needed by these sites — sites which are, frankly, not particularly sophisticated from a technical or design perspective.</p>
<p>Here's what I would suggest. First, make sure the SoapBlox admin is content to keep the sites up, at least temporarily. Second, find a college-age technical wunderkind who's interested in politics and willing to work for cheap. These guys are a dime a dozen — I used to be one myself. Third, convince him to write an exporter for the SoapBlox data that puts it in a standardized format. Hooking into <a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/p/google-blog-converters-appengine/">this project</a> (found via <a class="reference external" href="http://del.icio.us/al3x">al3x</a>) might not be a bad idea. Getting the data into a portable form is the priority.</p>
<p>Then, find someone at a consultancy like one of the aforementioned ones who's willing to help you figure out your requirements and specifications for a new suite of software. The simplest, best option is probably to just run Scoop. It's what you want anyway; might as well stop nosing around it. I'm not intimately familiar with Scoop, but a quick look at its installation procedure makes it look like the complexity of installing and running it has been vastly overstated. If you don't do that (or just want to help get the netroots off Scoop — a noble cause), then I'd suggest a hard look at Drupal and maybe Wordpress MU, or maybe Slashcode if for some reason you want to head toward Perl-land. You may have to get someone to develop a custom module or two to make the solution maximally Scoop-y, and you'll certainly need someone who knows their way around the system to help configure it.</p>
<p>But given where the aesthetic bar has been set, this is not a particularly tough problem, and it shouldn't cost that much money. If this community can afford to send people to Netroots Nation or the DNC, it can surely afford a minor investment in its critical infrastructure. Oh, and one more thing: when users inevitably raise a hue and a cry because the order of links on the sidebar has changed, or because they have to reconfirm their email address, or because of some other stupid thing, you should ignore them. They just want attention. Learning new systems and habits is a pain, but not nearly so painful as continuing to limp along in a system that never should have been used in the first place.</p>
