                    <p>Shoot me an email. We should chat.</p>
<p>Long story short, the skies were kept safe tonight from any designs I had on synthesizing a maple-based plastique while in flight. TSA acted professionally, in the sense that they said &quot;sir&quot; as they went about their officious buffoonery.</p>
<p>If you haven't already, you should read <a class="reference external" href="http://www.schneier.com/interview-hawley.html">this interview</a> with former* TSA chief Kip Hawley, conducted by Bruce Shneier. It will make two things immediately clear.</p>
<p>First, this agency was run by a man named Kip.</p>
<p>Second, the frustrating and apparently arbitrary nonsense that you, I and all other air travelers are continually subjected to is just what it seems. When the agent tried to explain to me that the listed weight of my proscribed carryon (in grams) was evidence of its violation of the volume limit? When the woman next to me was told that the difference between the limit, in millilieters, listed on the TSA.gov printout she was holding and the limit, in milliliters, being enforced against her owed to some arcane fact involving unit conversion and Canadian passengers? These are not merely the failings of overtaxed and undertrained staff. The whole agency is awash in arbitrary authoritarianism. Shneier pulls the curtain back, and the man behind just sits there smiling at him. He's named Kip! Glad to meet ya! But he couldn't possibly comment on that thing you just said, because if he did, one of our vaguely-defined but utterly-relentless enemies might realize the obvious thing that your non-expert mind just thought of during a fit of idle pique.</p>
<p>I understand why a Democratic administration can't undo this nonsense. But I am looking forward to the day when a new Republican administration decides to help itself to an easy PR victory by undoing the liquid ban and, hopefully, driving a naked, horsewhipped Kip Hawley -- or whomever has continued his legacy --through the laughing streets of DC.</p>
<p>There. Now I feel better.</p>
<p>* It appears that Kip is out as of the Obama administration, but a permanent replacement has not yet been named. Hopefully they will either be more thoughtful, or at least have a name of similar hilarity, making it easyto update this post.</p>

                    <p>I sort of buried this point in one of my long, super-boring net neutrality posts, but I've been going back and forth with Brooke about it on Twitter today, and consequently feel like emphasizing it: neutrality opponents would do themselves a favor by dropping the critiques that essentially say, &quot;Well, if you want to make your ISP more like the DMV, be my guest!&quot;</p>
<p>I mean, I get it: everyone hates the DMV, and the Post Office, and the IRS.&nbsp; Why, their eternal inefficiency is recorded in the formulaic sitcom scripts of our youth; for culture-free postmodern nostalgists, that's practically holy writ.</p>
<p>And actually, it <em>is</em> sort of true. I did find myself waiting at the Post Office for about 40 minutes earlier this year because they couldn't find a package that I'd gotten a delivery slip for (turns out it was already out for re-delivery, but they had no record of this).&nbsp; I've been bored at the DMV like everyone else.</p>
<p>But last week I spent 30 minutes on hold with Verizon before getting hung up on.&nbsp; This came after a visit to their store where the clerk gave me information that I know is incorrect, which came after a visit when the clerk just gave me some pamphlets (and more incorrect information) when he learned I already had an iPhone under contract. &nbsp; It took Comcast&nbsp; two appointments to get my Tivo set up when they could have just mailed me the goddamn CableCard. WTTG used to drop out during the 9 o'clock hour for some reason. Verizon once sent a collection agency after me for charges during a trial period that a clerk had assured me I wouldn't owe.&nbsp; And Emily paid for DSL for at least four months, during which time it worked <em>maybe</em> twice -- this despite both of us making repeated calls to tech support, and a couple of failed service calls.&nbsp; Hell, when my family first got DSL our troubleshooting file became so long that I had to wait about ten minutes every time I called in just so the tech could read it.</p>
<p>From everything I've seen, these experiences are not at all atypical.&nbsp; The point being: people might hate government inefficiency, but they really, <em>really</em> hate their ISPs.&nbsp; Maybe it's my own inclinations coloring my perceptions; maybe it's hopelessness in the face of bureaucracy versus fury at not getting what you paid for; but from my vantage point it's not even close: the home broadband duopoly has delivered a level of service significantly inferior to the one people expect from the public sector.</p>
<p>This is not to say that there are no good arguments to be mustered against government regulation of ISPs.&nbsp; But if you could make Comcast behave more like the water utility, most of their customers would immediately envelop you in a tearful, joyous embrace.&nbsp; The &quot;not the post office!&quot; free market trope is not only tired, but particularly ill-suited to this debate.</p>
<p><strong>TO CLARIFY:</strong> I don't think that the ISPs' awfulness is an affirmative argument <em>for</em> regulation.&nbsp; I just don't think that their wonderfulness is much of an argument <em>against</em> regulation.&nbsp; I've tried to make this distinction over at <a class="reference external" href="http://timothyblee.com/?p=1105&amp;cpage=1#comment-4523">Tim's place</a>, too.&nbsp; The broadband market is weird, and screwed up, and regulation might help or hurt or not matter much.&nbsp; But I don't know any consumers who are particularly in love with the status quo.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>I need to resist the urge to drone on and on about this, but having failed to heed Matt's encouragement to weigh in on the vital &quot;worst bar in DC&quot; debate, I feel obliged to pick this one up: why is <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cnas.org/blogs/naturalsecurity/2009/09/lithium-not-just-nirvana-song.html">CNAS's post about lithium</a> dumb?</p>
<p>First, some caveats: other than a brief tour through the world of materials science as an undergrad, several years' worth of pestering ChemE PhD friends about related issues, and time spent watching resource-shock warnings fail to materialize, I have no credentials to offer on this score.&nbsp; Defer to official-looking PDFs!</p>
<p>Onward. The first and most galling part is this:</p>
<blockquote>
Lithium is the <a class="reference external" href="http://periodic.lanl.gov/elements/3.html">lightest metal in nature</a> and an excellent conductor of electricity, and these two properties make it especially useful for batteries.</blockquote>
<p>This is just completely wrong. Lithium is useful for batteries because of its pronounced <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_electrode_potential_%28data_page%29">electrode potential</a>.&nbsp; Its lightness is a welcome attribute too, of course.&nbsp; But the person who wrote that sentence simply doesn't know much about batteries.</p>
<p>The other problem with the article is its wishy-washy buy-in of the peak lithium frame (the idea has been more forcefully expressed elsewhere).&nbsp; Most of the world's production of lithium ore comes from just a few places, and while CNAS acknowledges that they're politically stable, Bolivia is on the docket as <em>also</em> having a lot of lithium, and what if they become the key source?!</p>
<p>Anyone who looks for them will see these resource-scare stories pop up on sites like Slashdot every once in a while.&nbsp; It's frustrating, and all too easy to fall for, but the dire scenarios they foretell never seem to come to pass.&nbsp; I remember a professor with grave concerns about the unreliability of Kazakhstan's chromium barons; yet a decade later, I have more stainless steel-clad consumer crap than ever.&nbsp; And he was an expert!</p>
<p>With the general public, the capacity for resource fearmongering is much worse.&nbsp; Most people don't understand where metal comes from (admittedly, it is <a class="reference external" href="http://www.thetoasterproject.org/">sort of mysterious</a>).&nbsp; As they attempt to puzzle out this question, the facts that they have to work with tend to be A) we're running out of oil! and B) prospecting for gold looks hard in westerns.</p>
<p>Neither of these are really applicable to most mining.&nbsp; Oil's primary use is as fuel -- it's energy, not a durable good, and consequently we run through a ton of it.&nbsp; As a result, small price shifts can have really serious consequences across the economy.&nbsp; If you had to buy a new laptop battery every time your old one ran out of juice, the prospect of increasing lithium prices would concern me much more than it does.</p>
<p>Gold, meanwhile, is a heavy and therefore scarce element, and its nonreactivity helps to ensure that it's difficult to mine.&nbsp; It has some valuable properties, but it's mostly valuable because it's so rare.&nbsp; Applying lessons about the difficulty of mining gold to the mining of other substances is a mistake.</p>
<p>Here's the thing: ore is just material that has a little more of the substance you want in it than regular old rocks and dirt.&nbsp; It's a slightly better starting material, and therefore a more economical one to process.&nbsp; But there are lots of grades of ore.&nbsp; It sounds like Bolivia's got some good stuff!&nbsp; If that doesn't work out, though, we can probably find some not-quite-as-good stuff (look! Wikipedia says <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium#Occurrence">a firm has figured out how to economically extract lithium from hectorite clay</a>!). Or we can reactivate those not-currently-economical American mines that the CNAS post alludes to. Or we can recycle more lithium.&nbsp; All it takes is money and a reckless disregard for the environment.&nbsp; This is one of those things that the market really will solve.</p>
<p>So (still-theoretical) problems with our lithium supply could be bad news for the economic viability of electric cars, but we should resist the idea that we're going to run out of any minerals.&nbsp; I think we're a long way from needing to panic about lithium supplies the way that we need to panic about oil supplies.</p>
<p>(Helium, though -- boy, I don't know. My friends Jeff and Marie have got me worried about it. Seriously: we need it to cool some extremely interesting magnets, it's only found as a byproduct of natural gas extraction -- the helium is trapped underground along with the NG -- and once it's in the atmosphere it diffuses into space. Stop buying balloons, you monsters!)</p>

                    <p>I just got back from seeing Pains of Being Pure at Heart at the Black Cat. It was pretty good! Honestly, they offered just about everything that you could ask of a twee-pop band. They were fresh-faced and well behaved. They were <em>so excited</em> to be in DC (&quot;we love Teenbeat!&quot;). One of them had bangs! They were exactly what you would expect, and to say that is not to diminish their charm one bit.</p>
<p>The show didn't quite click for me, though. I can come up with a lot of plausible reasons: they front-loaded the setlist, their songs only have a couple of tricks, or, most obviously: I'm too old for this. Honestly, though, I don't think that's it. I think I'm just a bit out of practice. Sommer and I were talking about this in the Red Room before the show: we need to get back in the concert-attending habit. If the two fifty+ year-olds behind me in line were any indication, it's not over for us quite yet.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there's a hell of a lot of good stuff coming to the Black Cat in the next couple of months. I'd encourage any interested parties to pester me to attend the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>10/6 - Title Tracks - $8 (backstage)</li>
<li>11/6 - Thao with the Get Down Stay Down - $15</li>
<li>11/7 - Le Loup - $12</li>
<li>11/14 - Olivia Mancini &amp; the Mates - $8 (backstage, CD release)</li>
<li>11/20 - The Wrens - $15</li>
<li>12/3 - Ted Leo Rx - $15</li>
</ul>
<p>I guess that's it. I could be talked into Bishop Allen, Girls, Dirty Projectors, that guy from Television, or virtually anyone else who isn't Art Brut. And of course the Cat isn't the only game in town. I've got tickets for Gaslight Anthem, but I also see Dinosaur Jr., the Raveonettes and Built to Spill coming up at 9:30. Headlights is coming to DC9 on 10/25, and I'm <a class="reference external" href="/2008/05/01/aots-08/">on record</a> as loving them. A bit more tentatively, I could under the right circumstances head to RNR for the Spinto Band or Titus Andronicus.</p>
<p>In short: make me go to some shows, please. I'll drop these into a Google calendar shortly; if you're interested in contributing to that effort, let me know.</p>
<p>And to irrefutably prove that I'm serious, I'm making an <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Hearos-211-High-Fidelity-Plugs/dp/tech-data/B0002CZYS4/ref=de_a_smtd">impulse purchase</a> to facilitate this resolution.

                    <p>This Roman Polanski business is bothering me. Not that he's been arrested — I meant <a class="reference external" href="http://dcist.com/2009/09/morning_roundup_selective_enforceme.php">what I said in the morning roundup</a>: arresting him was the right thing to do, and I'm glad it happened.</p>
<p>But I'm bothered by those who are on my side (if I have to have a side). There are quite a lot of people expressing the sentiment that &quot;RT &#64;someguy: Polanski is a rapist and he belongs in prison. FULL STOP.&quot; I think they're basically right. But they're making a terrible error by being so self-satisfied about it. When we punish people, it's nothing to celebrate. We should perhaps make allowances for those personally affected by the misdeeds of the party that is to be punished. But when the rest of us glory in it, 140 smug characters at a time, we have no excuse. God, but it's bloodthirsty. This is an old man who will be punished for an old crime, and it's not going to do anybody any good, not really. It's just that it has to be done.</p>
<p>When I was writing that roundup I came across the story of a teenager who had just been sentenced for the murder of two people. The young man went into a house to steal and came across a gun. He loaded it, and it appears that he then discharged it into the head of a teenage boy who was sleeping on the living room couch. He then fled, but returned to collect a jacket he had lost. He encountered the boy's mother, who was on the phone with the police, and he shot her in the ear at close range.</p>
<p>I left that out of the roundup — I take pride in omitting crime stories with a sensationally terrifying element. But can you imagine a crime more casually horrible? Still, how could anyone picture the coming decades of that boy's life in prison and feel anything but crushing sadness?</p>
<p>By saying this I don't imply that I'm above what I'm decrying — in that morning roundup I took the Polanski case and spun it into a framing device that traded on crass moralism, and I did it simply because I wanted a punchy intro that would let me get to bed on time. But I, and everyone else, should probably show a little more restraint before reveling in the misfortune of the guilty. I hope that we punish people because it serves a larger purpose; it's the means by which we recommit ourselves to a system that has just failed us. For that reason it's a hopeful but fundamentally melancholy act. If it feels otherwise, something is wrong.</p>

                    <p>It's hardly worth noting, but <a class="reference external" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/09/27/AR2009092703026.html">this</a> is a lousy editorial.&nbsp; A couple of points, one of which I buried in the last post about net neutrality:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Comcast's reversal of its decision to fiddle with Bittorrent seems to be getting bandied about as an example of the market taking care of things. People should be less sanguine: it was not market pressure from clients but rather PR pressure from activists that forced Comcast to back down.&nbsp; And if the net neutrality issue hadn't been looming at the time, the outcome could easily have been different.&nbsp; Mustering that level of coordinated outrage is not a sustainable model for policing ISP behavior.&nbsp; Other ISPs offer evidence of gloomier scenarios: in Canada, Rogers has been throttling Bittorrent -- and, in fact, all encrypted traffic, since it can't distinguish encrypted BT from encrypted anything-else -- since at least 2005.&nbsp; Similar difficulties face customers of some Australian ISPs.&nbsp; And there are other policies that have been in place so long that people have stopped complaining: unless something has changed, I'm still prohibited from running a server for personal use off my home connection (in principle a server of any type; in practice, port 80 is the only one that will be caught). And it was years -- years! -- before Comcast disclosed or even acknowledged the existence of its secret bandwidth caps.&nbsp; Neutrality opponents are mistaking a single victorious battle for the absence of a war.</li>
<li>The Post piece refers to the broadband market as &quot;a vibrant and well-functioning marketplace&quot;. In truth, it's <a class="reference external" href="http://www.dslreports.com/shownews/Global-Broadband-Prices-Plummet-98942">stagnated</a>: in North America, prices remain steady -- at a rate above what much of the developed world pays -- while ongoing improvements in speed show little hope for of catching up with the networks of countries significantly poorer than the US.&nbsp; If the Post wants to argue that net neutrality will make the situation even worse, fine. But they don't even seem to realize that by global standards our domestic broadband marketplace is an underperformer.</li>

                    <p>In keeping with this site's new ambition to become a J. Sanchez metablog:</p>
<blockquote>
Randomly wondered when/why RAR supplanted ZIP as the default compression scheme. Internet knows: <a class="reference external" href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000798.html">http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000798.html</a> - &#64;normative, <a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/normative/status/4370570567">9/25/2009</a></blockquote>
<p>The Coding Horror writeup is characteristically excellent, but the story is actually a little more complicated than it implies.&nbsp; It provides good reasons why RAR is superior to ZIP.&nbsp; But why hasn't RAR been beaten by something else?</p>
<p>As with many technologies, the answer lies in the balance between the advantages of the new technology and the costs of sacrificing the incumbent technology's network effects -- that, and simple timing.&nbsp; To wit: 7Zip is a format that, in most situations, is <a class="reference external" href="http://kikizas.net/en/apps.7z.html">as good or better than RAR*</a>.&nbsp; It's also an open standard, unlike RAR.</p>
<p>So why isn't 7Zip in use instead of RAR?&nbsp; I think it comes down to timing.&nbsp; The standardization of large-file trading on Usenet demanded a format that could be broken into chunks, as a single post can only carry a limited amount of binary data**.&nbsp; ZIP can handle this sort of operation -- I have fond memories of spreading friends' EGA games across innumerable bitrot-ridden 1.44M floppies -- but it's a feature that had been ignored or intentionally dropped by many Windows 95-era ZIP clients.&nbsp; RARs were also typically a few percentage points smaller than ZIPs at a time when the average home user's internet connection was several orders of magnitude slower than it is today.</p>
<p>There was a moment when piracy became professionalized, and at that moment RAR was the best thing going.&nbsp; And it's still pretty good!&nbsp; The situation is quite similar to that of the MP3 format: it's been beaten by better audio compression schemes like Ogg Vorbis and AAC, but MP3 is good enough -- and popular enough -- that it's not worthwhile to tear out out the infrastructure that's been built around it.</p>
<p>Admittedly, I doubt that RAR will remain in vogue as long as MP3 will.&nbsp; A shift in audio codec means buying hardware players with new chipsets -- and, not infrequently, acquiescing to the DRM gimmicks of whatever corporation is pushing the new format.&nbsp; Archive formats can be counted on to only matter in a flexible general-purpose computing environment, where those concerns don't really apply.&nbsp; Also, archive formats can be selected in an ad-hoc manner by release groups made of technical users that are largely immune to network effects -- the popularity or usability of their release is much less important in their insular prestige economy them than is its timing.&nbsp; For these reasons <a class="reference external" href="http://isohunt.com/torrents/7z">it's not at all uncommon to run across 7Zip torrents</a>.</p>
<p>So RAR might fall out of fashion some day. But it owes more of its popularity to being the right technology at the right time than it does to its current technical merits.</p>
<p>* This comparison asserts that RAR's dominance has to do with its &quot;repair archive&quot; functionality.&nbsp; I disagree; I've never found that feature to be reliable enough to be worthwhile.&nbsp; Usenet file-traders agree with me, and instead rely on a checksum metafile standard called SFV which helps both to correct errors and, in some situations, to replace missing files.</p>
<p>** Torrents are presumably still broken into volumes because the releases have been plucked from Usenet, which remains the font of nearly all piracy. It's also handy to be able to download a single volume and run a checksum on it to look for malware before grabbing the whole archive, but this is a relatively uncommon thing for casual users to do.</p>

                    <p>Well, the FCC has announced its net neutrality guidelines, which means it's time for those with institutional or philosophical obligations to oppose net neutrality to express some disappointment and/or outrage.&nbsp; This process will reach its apotheosis in a day or two, when the sysadmin familiars are summoned to spin some exotic technical fables about neutrality regulation sending the internet and Western civilization spiraling toward jitter-mediated destruction.&nbsp; Then they will be rebutted, then they will respond, then they will be re-rebutted -- at this point we'll be talking about something entirely different than what we meant to discuss -- and they'll proceed to cudgel their interlocutors with references to network RFCs that can only be viewed if you have a key to the CERN sub-basement.&nbsp; At that point we'll all drop it until the next time the FCC holds forth.</p>
<p>But for now my combatants are far more&nbsp; reasonable, and pleasant, and include my friend Julian Sanchez, who&nbsp; starts things off with <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cato-at-liberty.org/2009/09/21/eye-of-neutrality-toe-of-frog/">this post</a> over at Cato (full disclosure: I still have some comic books that I need to return to him).&nbsp; But bristling at today's announcement is&nbsp; a surprisingly hard job, and I'm not completely convinced that Julian's heart is in it. It's not that he doesn't have the strength of his convictions; it's just that the FCC said very little today, and even less that's plausibly objectionable.&nbsp; Arguing against transparency is tough, and the only other new guideline remains too vague to really engage with.</p>
<p>But Julian does his duty:</p>
<blockquote>
[T]hey’ll do their best to flesh out the definition of “reasonable,” but in general they’ll “evaluate alleged violations…on a case-by-case basis.” Insofar as any more rigid rule would probably be obsolete before the ink dried, I guess that’s somewhat reassuring, but it absolutely reeks of the sort of <em>ad hoc</em> “I know it when I see it” standard that leaves telecoms wondering whether some innovative practice will bring down the Wrath of Comms only after resources have been sunk into rolling it out.</blockquote>
<p>I read this and see just the opposite: the FCC is essentially saying that if ISP, Inc. is interested in undertaking some network monkey business, it would behoove them to get on the phone with Washington before they get on the phone with Cisco.&nbsp; This is a burden, I suppose, but network-wide changes are a big enough deal and pursued at a sufficiently careful pace that I don't think it's likely to be a particularly onerous one.</p>
<p>To my mind the alternative is for the ISPs to roll out an expensive network upgrade, then say &quot;Whoops!&quot; when the FCC comes calling -- they'll have some plausible excuse why they can't go back, and perhaps they could just pay a fine or better yet be grandfathered in instead?</p>
<p>Julian would rather wait and see what happens.&nbsp; I feel as though we've seen enough -- and heard enough executives saying very stupid things about what they're owed by their customers and online businesses -- that adding some clarity to the regulatory situation is probably worthwhile.</p>
<p>I think that this is ultimately a cultural difference, though.&nbsp; It's just as in <a class="reference external" href="http://www.timothyblee.com">Tim</a>'s <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=9775">net neutrality paper</a> -- which is well worth a read, incidentally.&nbsp; At the risk of boiling it down to an insultingly oversimplified nut, he's generally skeptical of regulation and generally optimistic about the market's capacity for providing incentives for being non-evil.&nbsp; He makes a good case, but ultimately I don't find it convincing; just as I'm sure he doesn't find convincing my complementarily chipper attitude toward regulation and somber concern about looming corporate malfeasance.</p>
<p>What I am relatively sure of, though, is that everyone is overstating what's at stake.&nbsp; &quot;Innovation&quot; is unlikely to be hampered -- small, agile ISPs typically sell themselves by virtue of their openness (see Speakeasy), and the lumbering behemoths still have a profit motive to push them toward clever new ways of overselling a given pipe*.&nbsp; Similarly, there's something to Tim's argument that network discrimination is unlikely to be lucrative -- for now, at least, it's hard to imagine many companies playing ball with an ISP's extortionary tactics so long as online video remains a money-losing enterprise.</p>
<p>Anyway, if you really want a properly impassioned response to this FCC business, I recommend <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cato-at-liberty.org/2009/09/21/preemptive-regulation-of-the-internet/">Jim Harper's post</a>.&nbsp; He points out that consumer pressure means that no ISP would be able to, say, <a class="reference external" href="http://torrentfreak.com/canadian-isp-is-throttling-bittorrent-traffic/">interfere with bittorrent</a> for <a class="reference external" href="http://www.broadbandreports.com/shownews/Rogers-Bit-Torrent-Cat-Mouse-71914">long</a>; that utility deregulation is an <a class="reference external" href="http://enron.com/">obviously</a> great <a class="reference external" href="http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/energy/2007-08-09-power-prices_n.htm">idea</a>; and that in a net-neutral world, interacting with your ISP might become more like your dealings with the water company and less, well, <a class="reference external" href="http://consumerist.com/5242464/worst-company-in-america-championship-aig-vs-comcast">Comcastic</a>**. That last one is meant as a criticism, apparently.</p>
<p>More seriously, though, I will say that I'm encouraged to find that this debate has advanced beyond the stage where people are constantly saying dumb or dishonest things.&nbsp; Proponents no longer picture Rosa Parks whenever they hear about subjecting packets to Quality of Service measures; opponents have mostly given up pretending that the FCC is likely to enact rules so transparently stupid that they'd bring the internet to a grinding halt.&nbsp; Now it's just about the level of philosophical gloominess you're naturally predisposed to feel toward government intervention.&nbsp; I doubt that the conversation will head anywhere productive from here, but at least we've been here before -- it's unlikely to be particularly infuriating.</p>
<p><em>* Besides which, we already know the bounds of what can ever be wrung out of a connection thanks to Claude Shannon.&nbsp; Practical improvements are possible! But this shouldn't be thought of as a field of inquiry that's amenable to bold, game-changing breakthroughs if only the heavy hand of government is kept at bay.</em></p>
<p><em>** Becks told a story about seeing someone at the gym wearing a t-shirt identifying herself as a part of Comcast's support staff.&nbsp; &quot;That's like wearing a confederate flag t-shirt,&quot; was her quip, which sounded about right to me.</em></p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Over Twitter, Julian says <a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/normative/status/4157793129">this</a>, which I think is a much better criticism:</p>

<blockquote>
I'd b comfier w/ <a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/search?q=%23netneutrality">#netneutrality</a> if seemed boosters were thinking as much about incentive effects of specific rules as gen value of openness</blockquote>
<p>This is fair. You do occasionally see some thoughtless hippie nonsense coming from neutrality-boosters.&nbsp; But actually, changing incentives is <em>exactly</em> why I support this stuff.&nbsp; I want my ISP options to compete on price, reliability, speed and nothing else.&nbsp; I'm not interested in continuing to pay for the clever MBA who had all those &quot;SpeedBoost&quot; posters printed up.</p>
<p>Nor do I think that synergistic cross-subsidization schemes are likely to be helpful to the public.&nbsp; The example that tends to come to mind is those &quot;you can only use Visa at the Olympics&quot; ads.&nbsp; I guess we're supposed to think that the Olympics have only bothered to support the best or most important card.&nbsp; Or maybe that Visa's exclusive arrangement means that they're going to make ticket-buying easier by paying for some more kiosks that wouldn't be affordable in an open market? Whatever.&nbsp; In reality the setup is almost certainly this: Visa has taken some money from me and merchants I do business with in order to make life slightly less convenient for people attending the Olympics, then taken a bunch more money and spent it on telling me all about this bold innovation.&nbsp; Because they'd rather do this than be forced to compete by offering more favorable terms on their lending.</p>
<p>That's the sort of innovation I expect to see if we allow inventively-tiered pricing and partnerships.&nbsp; It's an unfortunately blunt mechanism, but if regulation is what it takes to convince Verizon that it's selling a commodity, that's fine by me.&nbsp; The market that's going to grow up on top of that system is more important than the principle of avoiding any imposition on the ISPs.&nbsp; Put another way: it may be that the drab, regulated water system has cheated me of consumer-facing innovations like leased rootbeer faucets, or additives that would save me from cleaning the tub as often.&nbsp; But I don't care about that: those gimmicks -- any water utility gimmicks -- are of miniscule importance compared to having a water system that works safely, predictably and efficiently.&nbsp; If Comcast needs to become a more boring place to work and a slightly less exciting business than it otherwise might be, it's not going to bother me even a little bit.</p>

                    <p>I think that <a class="reference external" href="http://dcist.com/2009/09/a_food_chain_unlike_any_other.php">this is great</a>: an aspiring lunch vendor has cleverly dodged the city's licensing limits on food carts by selling his product to existing hotdoggerias, whose licenses allow them to vend it.&nbsp; More lunchtime variety on the streets of DC is a good thing!</p>
<p>But I also find it kind of infuriating that these incumbent vendors are able to impose rents on the entrepreneur behind this effort.&nbsp; Sure, maybe he's glad to not have to finance or run a cart.&nbsp; But it's equally likely that he just isn't being allowed to compete because the city is artificially constraining the ability of food carts to compete.&nbsp; Instead some petrified halfsmoke purveyor gets some fraction of every dollar that this guy's ingenuity deserves.&nbsp; Why?!</p>
<p>Admittedly, my outrage at this probably has something to do with my own socioeconomic destiny.&nbsp; As a white guy who's getting older, fatter and more prosperous, it's only natural that I begin to feel increasingly outraged by insults to the burrito-selling Randian supermen that the market, freed from the clutches of incompetent District bureaucrats, would naturally elevate.&nbsp; To imply otherwise would threaten the legitimacy of my own relatively anointed status!&nbsp; And that's ridiculous: I am, after all, a valuable member of society, deserving of the respect and flat-panel TVs that come with my extraordinary and carefully-cultivated skills (ask me about the brilliant system I've devised for making sure I respond to email properly).</p>

                    <p>Surely any Redskins fan will agree that foremost among Dan Snyder's sins is his selection of a broadcast outlet that only provides its audio stream in Flash.</p>
<p>See, I'm going to be heading back from Philly this Sunday, and many Sundays besides, and I'd rather not miss the whole goddamn football season.&nbsp; If WTEM provided an MP3 stream this would be no problem -- the FStream iPhone app would let me listen to the game on stretches of I-95 well beyond the anemic reach of 980 AM.</p>
<p>That's not the case, though.&nbsp; WTEM uses a Flash-based streaming system, apparently through a vendor called streamtheworld.com.&nbsp; That's fine for the web browser, but the iPhone's too stupid to deal with Flash.</p>
<p>So I set out to provide an alternate stream.&nbsp; Amazon offers on-demand virtual servers through its EC2 service, and my first thought was to fire one of those up for each game.&nbsp; At ten cents an hour it would be affordable, and I could use the more-competent server to transcode the Flash stream into a more iPhone-compatible MP3 stream.</p>
<p>I got far enough along this path that I might as well share my work.&nbsp; Here's a quick recipe for setting up a VLC-transcoding-capable server on EC2:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">Launch the following Ubuntu AMI: ami-ed46a784</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Make sure that you've opened port 8080 in the relevant security settings.</p>
</li>
<li><div class="first line-block">
<div class="line">Execute these commands:</div>
</div>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">apt-get -y update</div>
<div class="line">apt-get -y install libmp3lame-dev</div>
<div class="line">apt-get -y install ffmpeg libavcodec-unstripped-52</div>
<div class="line">apt-get -y install vlc vlc-plugin-esd mozilla-plugin-vlc</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><div class="first line-block">
<div class="line">Execute something similar to, but not quite this:</div>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>sudo -u nobody vlc -vvv &quot;<a class="reference external" href="http://208.80.52.80/WTEMAM">http://208.80.52.80/WTEMAM</a>&quot; --sout '#transcode{acodec=mp3,ab=64}:standard{access=http,mux=asf,dst=}'</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This is close.&nbsp; It's <em>really</em> close.&nbsp; If you run this and then load up <a class="reference external" href="http://www.videolan.org">VLC</a> -- the amazingly useful media player -- and connect to the AMI on port 8080, you'll get a 64 kbps transcoded MP3 stream of the WTEM flash audio stream.&nbsp; It works well!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I don't know the specific incantation that makes this MP3 stream compatible with <a class="reference external" href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=289892007&amp;mt=8">FStream</a> on the iPhone.&nbsp; I tried various playlist formats.&nbsp; I tried various audio formats.&nbsp; I tried various container formats.&nbsp; There doesn't seem to be any decent documentation on the internet telling me what to do.&nbsp; It just says it's connecting, forever.</p>
<p>But while searching for a solution I discovered something interesting: there's an iPhone version of VLC!&nbsp; True, it's 13 megs, and yeah, it's only available on jailbroken phones (via the Cydia package manager).&nbsp; But it works great!&nbsp; I pointed it at <a class="reference external" href="http://208.80.52.80/WTEMAM">http://208.80.52.80/WTEMAM</a> and it started spitting out incomprehensible sports radio babble almost immediately.&nbsp; Admittedly, that was over wifi.&nbsp; But I see no reason to expect it to perform any worse over 3G than an equivalent MP3 stream would.&nbsp; I'll be giving it a shot on Sunday during the Giants game. And while I'm sorry to not be providing an MP3 stream for other fans, I'm glad to offer another reason to jailbreak your phone.</p>

<p>The process is going pretty well.&nbsp; We're using <a class="reference external" href="http://www.scarefx.com/project_coffin.html">these plans</a>, and while the quoted $25 cost is pretty optimistic, it <em>is</em> relatively affordable as these things go.&nbsp; At this point we've got the boards completely cut; we could assemble it immediately if we wanted.</p>
<p>First, though, I'd like to distress the wood.&nbsp; There are a lot of techniques for doing this, and we've tried several of them on scraps left from the cutting.&nbsp; I'd like to produce an impossibly-weathered sort of gray plank.&nbsp; The internet says the lye in oven cleaner ought to manage this, but so far it seems to have done nothing -- maybe we have the wrong oven cleaner, or perhaps the board's pressure-treated nature is interfering with the deadly chemical reaction.&nbsp; Emily found a method involving vinegar and steel wool, and claims that it shows promise (I remain skeptical).</p>
<p>The only methods that have proven to work are more physical in nature.&nbsp; First, the wire brush: using a drill and an appropriate abrasive wheel allows one to scrape away the weaker portions of&nbsp; the wood's surface, leaving raised ridges and producing a more fibrous, soft sort of finish.&nbsp; It looks good.</p>
<p>The other method is to char the surface with a propane torch.&nbsp; It doesn't produce the gray color I wanted, but the effect is sort of cool, particularly when applied after the wire brush.</p>
<p>Both techniques are fairly labor-intensive, though (particularly the brushing when using only a hand drill).&nbsp; If anyone has access to an angle grinder or feels like joining me in my garage for some beer, fire and power tools, drop me a line.</p>

<p>Except apparently this isn't <em>Avatar</em>. I mean, it is. But that's not <strong>the</strong> <em>Avatar</em>, the one getting directed by James Cameron. Ours is <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em>, the Peabody Award-winning three-season animated series that's deeply influenced by Hayao Miyazaki's films. But the apparently-nominal <em>Avatar</em> that's gotten everyone else excited is a bulbous epic that appears to be one part Warcraftian Night Elf cinematic and one part <a class="reference external" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108843/">M.A.N.T.I.S.</a> I've got no idea why people find this premise compelling: it's hardly the first time that hard sci-fi specificity has been used to excuse high fantasy ridiculousness. But eh, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZH149fYbUM">whatever</a>.</p>
<p>What I can say is that this airbender business is pretty solid. It's admittedly all a bit Captain Planet; and the middle standalone episodes of each twenty-episode season are no better or worse than a standard kid's cartoon. But the art is of a consistently high quality, and the important episodes -- if this were the X-Files, we'd call them the mythology episodes -- are always engaging (and charming!). The super-powered fight choreography is also noteworthy: it's inventive, and it doesn't repeat itself. That's unusual.</p>
<p>Oh, also, one of the characters has a gigantic flying bison. In other words: recommended.</p>
<p>(For what it's worth, this property is also being adapted into a series of three films M. Night Shyamalan; I don't have particularly high hopes for them, though.)</p>

<p>On the other hand, I also agree with Julian that the government's proper response is probably to threaten to regulate rather than to actually regulate.&nbsp; It seems like the relevant bureaucrats might agree: <a class="reference external" href="http://timothyblee.com/?p=379&amp;cpage=1#comment-84">I think this may be the tack that the FCC is taking with respect to the iPhone and AT&amp;T</a>.</p>

                    <p>Tim <a class="reference external" href="http://timothyblee.com/?p=452">wades in</a> to the debate about robots replacing low-skilled workers. I don't think I <a class="reference external" href="/2009/08/09/will-machines-render-low-skilled-workers-useless/">made my case</a> as strongly as I could have, and consequently I can't resist responding, if only briefly.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>I didn't react to the &quot;cost of materials and energy&quot; argument as forcefully as I should have. I really, really, really don't think this is going to be an issue. Machines are <em>much</em> more efficient than humans -- that's sort of the whole point. It's not at all a subtle difference, but rather a massive leap (they don't call the first sweeping wave of automation a revolution for nothing). The price of technology continues to fall. And the energy costs we're talking about are slight: keeping a Roomba charged takes about <a class="reference external" href="http://www.treehugger.com/files/2008/12/this-or-that-roomba-versus-upright.php">a third as much power</a> as illuminating the lamp on your nightstand -- and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/C/AE_compact_fluorescent_lamp.html">that's if the lamp is using a compact fluorescent bulb</a>.</li>
<li>Tim's discussion of our hardwired preference for other humans is an interesting one. But I'm not sure this is a problem that will be as resistant to engineering as he thinks. Consider <a class="reference external" href="http://www.japantrendshop.com/paro-robotic-healing-seal-p-144.html">Paro, the robot seal</a>. By all accounts he works pretty well at soothing nursing home patients. Tim's probably right that people would prefer -- and pay for -- a human R.N. rather than Rosie the Robot in nursing scrubs. But if a suite of relatively simple assistive technologies is cheaper than either -- partially automated showers, biomonitors, pill reminders and the like -- they'll probably settle for that.</li>
</ol>
<p>Human labor remaining competitive with robots seems to assume that one of two things will happen.</p>
<p>First, wages for unskilled labor could be pushed even further down. Presumably this is supposed to happen as average income continues to rise. I'm not sure how this can be considered feasible, either practically or ethically -- we're basically talking about reinventing the serf.</p>
<p>Second, robots could become dramatically less economical due to some sort of resource or energy shock. But given robotic efficiency (and the reality of their still-falling prices), it's hard for me to envision this happening except in the sort of catastrophic scenario in which maintaining human employment levels would be the least of our worries.</p>
