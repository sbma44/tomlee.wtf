                    <p>I've begun screwing around with my attempt at a larger-buffer Hype Machine player, and became aware of HTTP dereferers in the process. Want to provide a link to a site, but not have the site's owner track it back to you? Then use one of these things.</p>
<p>Here's an example. First, the normal link, which will go to a page showing your HTTP referer information on the third line from the top:</p>
<blockquote>
<a class="reference external" href="http://c2.com/cgi/test/">http://c2.com/cgi/test/</a></blockquote>
<p>and now the same link, passed through a dereferer:</p>
<blockquote>
<a class="reference external" href="http://ultimod.org/?url=http://c2.com/cgi/test/">http://ultimod.org/?url=http://c2.com/cgi/test/</a></blockquote>
<p>Handy!</p>
<p>Of course, it's no help on my particular project — what I was actually looking for was a proxy that will spoof my HTTP referer string on the fly. Unfortunately, referer spoofing seems to be constrained to the realm of the browser plugin (it's commonly used to get free porn from protected sites), and even the excellent <a class="reference external" href="http://www.squid-cache.org/">Squid Proxy</a> doesn't seem to have this functionality (or at least it's not written up in an easy-to-find manner). But I think I can get by without this workaround.</p>

<p>This isn't a huge surprise, since both formats use the same underlying copy protection system. Still, it's good to see. Sony can't be trusted with media formats — their instinct is to lock consumers into them for the greater glory of Sony. I was worried that the downside to the HD-DVD crack would be greater enthusiasm for Blu-Ray. Now that both have been cracked, it's a fair fight once again.</p>

                    <p>It's slightly ridiculous, but I have to confess that I've only recently discovered <a class="reference external" href="http://hype.non-standard.net">Hype Machine</a>. I've been aware of its existence for a while, but my previous attempts to use it always met with failure. The flash player didn't work right on my old laptop, and the HM iTunes link never has and still doesn't work properly for me. With those functions unavailable, I didn't see a compelling-enough reason to use the site.</p>
<p>But, spurred by references to it in an Unfogged thread, I gave it another shot, got the flash player to work, and found out that it's unbelievably great. There's one major downside, though: I seem to run into buffering problems with the player on a pretty regular basis. This is an infuriating way to listen to music, and particularly bad when I try to use the app through the Wii web browser (the console is hooked up to my stereo, after all — in theory, this could make for a great at-home radio station).</p>
<p>The HM flash player uses the open-source <a class="reference external" href="http://musicplayer.sourceforge.net/">XSPF Music Player</a>, so I'm optimistic that I'll be able to crack it open and implement some more stringent buffering. Unfortunately, my initial explorations revealed that the site uses some irritating redirects and is going to require me to do stupid things like fake my HTTP referer and user agent string. I realize that's gibberish to many of you, but trust me when I say that it's totally lame.</p>
<p>So it may be a little while before I really get my hands dirty with this project. In the meantime, I can't resist posting these two tracks, both of which I'm a little obsessed with (the latter despite not really liking CYHSY):</p>

                    <p>I wouldn't normally beat a dead horse like this, but this is not only a subhead, but from the same issue as the <a class="reference external" href="/2007/01/18/get-got/">last quote I bitched about</a> (the issue's been lying around the office, and I've been slowly flipping through it). The prominence of this apparent typo is giving me pause, making me wonder if either a) I'm badly confused about the proper use of the verb &quot;got&quot;; or b) this reflects some new and wholly intentional editorial policy at Time. Anyway: huh.</p>

                    <p>I really don't think I did, but I <em>was</em> out drinking that night, so I suppose I should just go ahead and ask. Michael, Matt, Ezra, Sam, Sarah and everyone else who was out on Friday: did we get drunk at Townhouse and then go grocery shopping in Michigan? Normally I wouldn't ask, but Bank of America sent me an email on Saturday morning wondering about these charges:</p>
<p><img alt="some jerk used my card at kroger" class="center" src="/static/2007/01/21/20070117_kroger.gif" style="width: 481px; height: 69px;" /></p>
<p>I've gone ahead and ordered a new card, but man oh man will I ever feel sheepish if I find a cancelled and beer-stained Kroger receipt lying around the apartment a week from now.</p>
<p>More seriously, this has been surprisingly easy to deal with — I had the whole thing wrapped up and a temporary ATM card in hand within about an hour of getting the initial alert email. It's a real credit to Bank of America, I think, and even more noteworthy when you consider how essentially evil an organization they are.</p>
<p>The obvious question to ask is how the crook got my number at all. I haven't been patronizing internet retailers particularly much in the last week or two, but I did make a few suspect purchases:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A while ago I ordered something from <a class="reference external" href="http://www.sparkfun.com">SparkFun Electronics</a>. But those guys are great, and I've ordered from them once before. I don't think it could be them.</li>
<li>I bought a new cellphone battery from a somewhat shady Ebay retailed not too long ago. But I made the payment through PayPal (or Yahoo stores; I forget which), so I kind of doubt it was them.</li>
<li>The final and most troubling possibility is the Wii: I bought Super Mario 64 about an hour before leaving the house on Friday night, and did so by using the Wii's integrated store. But surely Nintendo processes payments securely, right? Right?</li>
</ul>
<p>My childlike faith in the internet makes it hard for me to believe that it's any of these candidates. I haven't gone through my back statements to check for earlier fraud, so it could have happened before these three candidates — I just don't know. There's also a non-electronic possibility: it could've been stolen when I opened a tab at DC9 on Thursday night, too. I did end up with a suspiciously low bar tab.</p>
<p>Anyway, it's all very mysterious, but for now the danger seems to have passed.</p>

<p>Today started off on an exciting note, with police sirens screeching and officers screaming at a couple of gentlemen about 150 feet from my bedroom window. &quot;Get down and put your hands up!&quot; seemed to be the core message, but the officers tried out a number of different variations (consistent delivery, though). My real camera's battery had run down, so this is the best picture I could manage; you'll have to take my word for the fact that it was kind of awesome (or at least loud).</p>

<p>I mostly just like this because it makes me feel better about the many times when a typo of mine has made it onto DCist. Also, it provided a handy excuse to put Photoshop CS3 through the paces (Review: it works! But it doesn't use the right style of brush cursor when you're zoomed in.).</p>

                    <p>Well, that was kind of a waste of time. But it was fun, and I suppose I learned a few new things.</p>
<p>I decided, for no particular reason, to try turning a video clip into an ascii art version of itself. In theory, this can be [STRIKEOUT:easily] accomplished via a number of different open source projects:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://handbrake.m0k.org/">Handbrake</a> rips the video from the DVD</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://ffmpeg.mplayerhq.hu/">ffmpeg</a> pulls the video frames out, one-by-one, and turns them into JPEGs</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://jp2a.sourceforge.net/">jp2a</a> turns each frame into an HTML, ASCIIfied version of itself</li>
<li>Something turns the resulting HTML back into a graphic file. I would have liked to use <a class="reference external" href="http://khtml2png.sourceforge.net/">khtml2png</a>, but I couldn't get it to work. I tried a few other things, but none of them worked, either. I ended up using <a class="reference external" href="http://www.paulhammond.org/webkit2png/">webkit2png</a>. But it was still a pain in the ass to get working, and it only works on OS X. Bah!</li>
<li>Used the convert tool from the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.imagemagick.org/">ImageMagick</a> package to crop and convert the file back to a JPEG.</li>
<li>ffmpeg puts everything back together</li>
</ul>
<p>All of the above occurs in different phases on my mac and a linux machine, and various parts are held together by some Perl.</p>
<p>I chose the opening scene of <em>The Big Lebowski</em> for my test, but it ended up being a bad choice: I thought that the closeups of all the bowling paraphenalia would be easy to recognize, but something with a lot of human faces might've been a better idea. Also, ffmpeg seems to fail at putting audio back onto Flash video — I'm not sure what that's all about, since I was able to add the audio back when trying it with different formats. If anybody's got any idea what's going on, let me know.</p>
<p>At any rate, here are the fruits of my labor. It's somewhat neat, but probably not something I'll waste a lot more time on. The effect would probably look a lot better on fullscreen, uncompressed video — but that's not really my arena. For what it's worth, the effect works best during the scenes in the middle of the clip.</p>
<p>Oh! The embedded flash video player I'm using is from <a class="reference external" href="http://www.jeroenwijering.com/?item=Flash_Video_Player">here</a>, and seems to be fairly slick. Also: if you can't see the video, it's because I'm hosting it through the coral CDN. If your firewall at work doesn't let port 8090 through, you're SOL. Don't worry: like I said, it's not exactly life-changing.</p>
<p>I think I'd probably get much better results with a cartoon, especially if I did some preprocessing to crank up the video's saturation and brightness before feeding it to jp2a. But until I've got a clean linux system (or a genuine need) I don't think I'll bother — the khtml2png solution is the right way to do screencaps. webkit2png not only requires me to pull all the files onto a mac, it makes the system's dock undulate in an oddly sensual manner as the related icon pops in and out of it for every file that's processed. It's disturbing.</p>

                    <p>Ars Technica <a class="reference external" href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20070115-8622.html">reports</a> that the first HD-DVD movie rip has shown up on the Bittorrent networks. It's <em>Serenity</em>, the same disc used in the AACS-cracking proof of concept that I discussed at length last week. There's a very small chance that <em>Serenity's</em> key was obtained through non-technical means, and that the breach is therefore confined to that disc. But I wouldn't bet on it.</p>
<p>So this makes it official: the genie is out of the bottle. What's more, it now looks like the use of PowerDVD in the the original cracker's demonstration video may have been a red herring. If that's the case, then the HD-DVD consortium is going to be scrambling to figure out what the vulnerability actually is so that they can revoke the appropriate key (assuming that key revocation can fix the vulnerability).</p>
<p>The HD-DVD folks may yet recover from this. But until they do, DRM on the HD-DVD format should be considered dead.</p>

                    <p>Well, I'm back. The retreat was fun, and surprisingly useful. I'm more hostile than most when it comes to what I call team-ology — the sort of unscientific time-wasters that arise when someone takes an ex-CEO's platitudes about proactivity (or whatever else) a little too seriously. A surprisingly large number of people can be convinced that a set of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.successories.com/index.cfm/fuseaction/dir_product.brand_title_sku/product_group_id/e429709c-250d-488d-a7bb-90f537107324/brand_id/e1624976-0a99-4882-a357-9fa2471c0b4b/product_title_id/f045815b-2367-4b4a-86fd-70bd3f8012b2/product_id/6818c9b9-d30d-4419-bb21-43bcafec1d9d/page_number/1/page_sort/name/product_theme_id/e5c78b41-e1d4-4e31-9b7b-736baa0eb698/Above-Beyond.cfm">successories-style</a> cliches nested in a simply-made-up dependency tree counts as a theory of something. Ropes courses and trust falls are infinitely more useful than that sort of bullshit.</p>
<p>Fortunately there was surprisingly little of that stuff on the ED retreat. Most of the exercises we did were useful or led to useful conversations. Still, for sheer team-building efficacy nothing can compete with drinking beer and playing DDR:</p>
<p>We had almost no internet access at the site, so I've been out of touch. That's led to me being a bad blogger, contenting myself over the weekend with adding useless <a class="reference external" href="http://kailashnadh.name/ducksoup/">Technorati widgets</a> and archives to this site instead of content. I can't say that the trend of pointless but technically interesting effort is going to end anytime soon — here's a teaser for the latest <a class="reference external" href="/2006/12/08/be-your-own-aronofsky/">useless thing</a> that I'm trying to do with video:</p>

                    <p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.informationleafblower.com">Kyle</a> was at the Post blogger summit last night, too, but he came away with some <a class="reference external" href="http://www.informationleafblower.com/blog/archives/2007/01/to_the_summitan.html">different impressions</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">All the tech geeks in the room started tearing The Post's new feature apart (even though it's still in development and not online yet!) because it didn't have things like geocoding.</div>
<div class="line">... Does anyone give a shit about geocoding? I certainly don't. Do I need to know what blogs about U Street are actually written in apartments on U Street? Seems like a tool for stalkers more than anything else.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Ah, but you <em>should</em> give a shit about it, Kyle, because it's <strong>great</strong>. Or at least it has the potential to be.</p>
<p>The point of assigning a precise latitude and longitude to a blog isn't to provide useless data like how far from U Street someone lives. It's to provide an objective, universal way of determining location.</p>
<p>Yes, the Post will split up its list of blogs by neighborhood. That'll be useful enough within the Post site. But what about when you want another system to talk to it? Does System X use the same boundaries for Shaw as the Post does? Do they call the area near the Verizon Center Chinatown or Gallery Place or both? Are any neighborhoods divided into north/south or east/west distinctions, and are those divisions the same across the platforms? Do either of them recognize <a class="reference external" href="http://www.dcist.com/archives/2005/12/09/midwho.php">Midcity</a> as a real area?</p>
<p>Latitude and longitude are a language that every system can speak. Without them, you have to write code to account for the differences between each system — code that will break as soon as someone decides to make a minor change to their categorization system.</p>
<p>Hopefully you're convinced that geocoding is important for system interoperability. But why is interoperability important? Well, because the coming location-aware future is going to be really, really cool. Imagine that there's a fire in Columbia Heights, and bloggers located near it are instantly emailed and asked for any impressions they might have. Or think about <a class="reference external" href="http://www.zillow.com/">Zillow</a> providing links to blogs in a property's neighborhood. Or a geocoded story on washingtonpost.com featuring links to writers in the neighborhood. Or a survey of bloggers across the city asking how well a particular city service is delivered in their neighborhood. You might be able to accomplish some of these tasks with a combination of Google and patience, but geocoding would make them all simpler, faster and more reliable.</p>
<p>In short, geocoding is something that non-geeks don't have to worry about, but shouldn't belittle or fight. It's going to allow my fellow dorks to deliver a lot of fairly amazing applications. Geocoded information may not be interesting to humans in its raw form — I think we're all pretty sick of Google Maps mashups by now — but the things that computers can do with it are downright fascinating.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>I just got back from <a class="reference external" href="http://www.dcist.com/archives/2007/01/02/washington_post.php">the Post's blogger summit thingy</a>. How was it? Well, there wasn't any booze. But it was pretty interesting. The Washington Post has plans for you, little blogger.</p>
<p>Among them:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>They've <a class="reference external" href="http://adv.washingtonpost.com/blogroll/2006/11/about_blogroll_1.html">already launched</a> and will be continuing to build upon a hyperlocal AdWords competitor that only shows ads when it can beat the AdWords <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_Per_Mille">CPM</a>. The assembled bloggers seemed most interested in this, despite the fact that it'll likely mean a difference of a fraction of a cent per click. Nobody who was in that room is going to become rich off of this (although you'd never know it from the volume and pugnacity of the questions that it prompted). But it's interesting from the Post's perspective: it's a forward-thinking way of reclaiming ground from Craigslist. That's pretty smart.</li>
<li>More interestingly, they plan to launch a directory of DC blogs. Of course, <a class="reference external" href="http://dcblogs.com/">we've already got a good one</a>. But the Post seems certain to become the canonical index. It'll be good to have this stuff in one high-profile place, and even better to have it exposed to the Post's massive readership. On the whole, it seems certain to be a win for the DC blogosphere.</li>
</ul>
<p>But there are some downsides:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>They intend to rip off the already-much-ripped-off DCist Flickr pool idea. C'est la vie. But credit where due: I believe it was <a class="reference external" href="http://www.goodspeedupdate.com/">Rob</a>'s idea originally, and it was a great one. But they may get more than they're bargaining for: they're a family newspaper — I suspect spam and griefers will be a problem for something as high profile as this. I got the distinct impression that they don't have a full-time staffer available to run this thing.</li>
<li>They didn't seem very receptive to the idea of providing an API. I think that's a shame — directories of this kind ought to be open and accessible. I suppose I'll write some Perl to turn it into an OPML file every day and serve it up somewhere. Still, it would be nice if they embraced the spirit of openness. They'll be offering some RSS feeds, but I don't think that's enough.</li>
<li>Similarly, despite their goal of by-neighborhood categorization, they seemed nervous about precisely geocoding the participating blogs. <a class="reference external" href="http://nikolasrschiller.com/">Nikolas Schiller</a> kept pushing for it, and I joined him, but they claimed to be worried about the privacy implications — and eventually turned the word &quot;geocoding&quot; into a running joke, as if they didn't know what it meant. Now, I do think that Nikolas is a bit map-happy, but he's absolutely right about this. There are pretty simple ways to collect and use precise data without exposing it to dangerous weirdos.</li>
</ul>
<p>But I'm sure that privacy is only part of their concern. Finding someone to write the API and geocoding stuff is probably the bigger stumbling block. They seem like they're building a pretty basic Yahoo-style directory (right down to trying to settle on a fixed taxonomy for participating bloggers to use), and I imagine they don't want to complicate anything. But the API could consist of a handful of simple REST calls, and geocoding is just a Google Maps mashup away (it's a lot easier than it looks). The front page will just be a little fun, flashy stuff thrown on top of their crawled RSS database.</p>
<p>As for their motivation, I think it must primarily be out of the goodness of their hearts — and wanting to be the center of the DC blogosphere. Other than attracting participants to their ad program, I don't see how they're going to monetize it. So call it a good thing for the blogs of DC — but not as good a thing as it could be.</p>
<p>Oh! They're also going to begin geocoding their <a class="reference external" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/rss/index.html">RSS feeds</a> soon. That was probably the most exciting thing I heard all night.</p>

                    <p><a class="reference external" href="http://speeddial.cell-ular.com/">Slotcars that you control by yelling into your phone</a>, thanks to <a class="reference external" href="http://ww.asterisk.org">Asterisk</a> and an <a class="reference external" href="http://www.arduino.cc">Arduino</a>. Pretty neat, and somewhat similar to a project that I finished not too long ago for our office's lobby (more on that soon). I wonder how he pulls apart the SIP VoIP stream...</p>
<p>The creator's <a class="reference external" href="http://cell-ular.com/">other project</a> is pretty cool, too — it uses <a class="reference external" href="http://www.processing.org">Processing</a> and cameraphones and image recognition to an interesting effect. I can't figure out how the hell one uses the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.mobot.com/">mobot</a> image recognition service that he refers to, though.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Check out <a class="reference external" href="http://www.megaphone3000.com/">this project</a>, too, from the <a class="reference external" href="http://itp.nyu.edu/show/results.php?sortby=class">same show</a>. With the number of bars and clubs that have prominent video displays, the low cost of the software (and VoIP service) and the ubiquity of cell phones, I really think a fun business could be made out of creating and selling machines that offer this kind of ad-hoc head-to-head gaming. I know I'd enjoy watching a projection of a few people play a game of Bomberman while waiting for the next band set up at a 9:30 show. Maybe the winner gets some money off his tab — it'd be great.</p>
