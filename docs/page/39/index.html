                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>Last night I went to go see <a class="reference external" href="http://wryandstanley.blogspot.com">Ray's</a> band, <a class="reference external" href="http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&amp;friendID=15265814">Truman Sparks</a>. They were supposed to play at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.millcreektavernphilly.com/">Millcreek</a>, a West Philly venue that Emily and I had been to before. We'd gone to see the final show by <a class="reference external" href="http://www.myspace.com/thebearattack">Bear Attack</a>, a now-defunct punk band known for dressing up as an <a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/1955350060/">owl, bear</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/1954526831/">hunter</a> and performing a catalog of songs solely concerned with bears and their sundry activities. Sadly, the band wasn't in costume for their final show (I'm told that costume-related disputes are the reason they broke up), and it soon became apparent that their foremost and perhaps only non-ursine distinguishing characteristic was volume.</p>
<p>Millcreek was a weird venue. Picture a personality-free &quot;fitness center&quot; from a timeshare condo development, then imagine using it to serve alcohol — that covers the physical structure, at least. The bartender eyed us suspiciously, distributing Miller Lite while silently assessing our allegiance to Philadelphia's sports teams. A steady progression of black, middle-aged couples arrived and immediately went upstairs and past a second bouncer, not paying any attention to the show or bar — it's still unclear whether their destination was a poker club, a swinger's club, or both. Outside, a West Philly club kid took drags from a cigarette and earnestly told us a story about entering into a sham green-card marriage with a guy she met on the road; each of them assumed the marriage was interracial until they stopped traveling and showered.</p>
<p>The venue was teetering on the edge of civilization in what I'm assured is a distinctly West Philadelphian way. Ray &amp; co. showed up to play Milcreek and found it was closed. The only option left was left was to tumble right over that edge.</p>
<p>So instead we ended up heading to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.pifas.net/">The Philadelphia Institute For Advanced Study</a>, the online hilarity of which probably can't be appreciated unless you've set foot in the place. Located in Fishtown's warehouse-and-murder district, the building is actually a former sheet metal storage facility that's been taken over (by UVA alums, according to Ray) and converted into artists' studios. It was freezing cold, full of broken electronic slot machines, and in a wholly deserted neighborhood. After doing some superficial equipment unloading Emily and I set out in search of beer, but found only rotting industrial carcasses. The traffic consisted solely of very occasional ricers tearing down the wide, empty boulevards at 80 mph, killing time until the next <em>Fast and the Furious</em> movie is released.</p>
<p>Somehow we managed to get back to the warehouse without being robbed or murdered. The band had acquired some PBR tallboys in the meantime, which made the earnest Minneapolitan openers' set considerably easier to take. After their triumphant acoustic-guitar-and-clarinet alt country finale, the crowd retired to the more rock-capable <a class="reference external" href="http://www.pifas.net/main/program/5">photography department</a>, where Truman Sparks made good on their promise to melt our faces off amidst scattered photochemicals. At some point a threatening-looking guy in gold chains and an orange blazer showed up wearing airport-style ear protection. But he didn't end up trying to murder us, either, which was strangely disappointing.</p>
<p>[flickr]set:72157603067432837[/flickr]</p>
<p>But the show wasn't. I'm sure the band would've preferred to be somewhere with heat, comped beers and a functioning PA, but I don't really feel any need to revisit Mill Creek until I'm a graying African-American professional looking to spice up his marriage. PIFAS was rock and roll, goddammit, and I had a great time.</p>

                    <p>Over the weekend I briefly considered writing a FaceBot to take the reins of my completely-neglected FaceBook account. I have no interest in logging in and grappling with my acquaintances' neverending lycanthropic demands. But it shouldn't be too hard to write a script that does, thereby proving that I exist as a social entity. For an extra layer of authenticity the bot would watch the RSS coming out of Google News and periodically create a new group with a title like &quot;WE WILL NEVER FORGET YOU Musharraf Declares Martial Law&quot;.</p>
<p>The possibilities were endless. But then I remembered that I'm supposed to be doing a million other things, several of them arguably more important.</p>
<p>Besides, I'm growing convinced that Flickr's already implemented this sort of breakthrough technology. Check out these comments, all of which I've received in the last week:</p>

                    <p>Back online! See, the new machine uses CGI and suexec instead of mod_php, and so files with permissions greater than 0755 throw an error, but Movable Type creates files at 0666 by default. It's obviously all pretty fascinating, but the short version is that everything should now be fixed.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>I was making my usual rounds of anti-telco, pro-neutrality, red-meat-servin' blogs the other day when I came across this <a class="reference external" href="http://techdirt.com/articles/20071030/100621.shtml">proposal from TechDirt's Mike Masnick</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
[H]ere's a simple suggestion for mobile operators: Be the first to be totally upfront about your plans and services, remove any high pressure sales techniques, stop making it difficult to compare plans, phones and service and dub yourself as the customer friendly mobile operator. Then see what happens. Of course, some mobile operators have taken steps in this direction over the years. They're a lot more open about where various deadspots are than before and they've tried to be more open about specific features and plans -- but the problem is that this &quot;secretive&quot; mentality exists up and down throughout the organization. If a company makes it clear policy from top to bottom that openness, clarity and customer satisfaction are keys, it would capture the interest of an awful lot of people.</blockquote>
<p>The same criticism could be leveled against Comcast for their recent Bittorrent-throttling antics or their not-actually-unlimited plans. And Comcast would be just as likely to take the advice to be upfront and forthright as the mobile operators are, which is to say not at all. You can see the reason for this in the <a class="reference external" href="http://techdirt.com/article.php?sid=20071030/100621#c13">very first comment</a> left on Mike's post, which appears to have been authored by a defensive employee of the cellular industry:</p>
<blockquote>
If you don't like wireless companies it is simple...this is not a commodity or necessity of life such as water or power, this is a instrument that you choose to purchase and pay for. If you don't like it, don't buy it.</blockquote>
<p>I think that this demonstrates the problem with the cable companies, the mobile companies, the record companies and (before they decided they wanted to be Google without the technology or marketshare) AOL, too: they don't understand or won't admit the nature of what it is that they're actually selling. It's not what the commenter thinks.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, there are only two ways to make money by selling data to consumers. First, you can sell the signal: a catchy song, a fascinating print article, an entertaining video — you make it and you charge for access. It's a pretty straightforward way of earning a living. Second, you can sell the delivery: you can charge for transmuting and transporting the signal into a location and form that's easy for consumers to use.</p>
<p>These both used to be noble and lucrative fields of endeavor. The world will always have an appetite for original creative works. For a while it looked like the same could be said of novel methods of data delivery: radio was great, television was better, the telephone turned out to be pretty handy, and recorded music attracted something of a following. It seemed like the world had a bottomless appetite for new, increasingly efficient and ever-more specialized methods of delivering signals to consumers via enormous, capital-intensive infrastructures.</p>
<p>But it didn't! Digital technology arrived and the world, while hungrier for content than ever, found that it preferred a steady diet of packets. The arrival of cheap and incredibly flexible signal processors on our desktops and in our entertainment centers made the old, centralized and largely analog infrastructure increasingly unnecessary. The development of information theory let us identify and draw very close to the theoretical maximum efficiency for signal transmission.</p>
<p>These days any signal can be made into packets, and we've pretty much figured out the best ways to move those packets. All that's left is to do the actual moving. That's the business the aforementioned companies are in: they ship bits.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, as Nicholas Negroponte <a class="reference external" href="http://web.media.mit.edu/%7Enicholas/Wired/WIRED4-09.html">noted</a>, &quot;Shipping bits [is] a crummy business.&quot; That's because bits are a commodity.</p>
<p>It must be pretty awful to wake up one day and suddenly realize that you're in a commodity business. As a software developer I've at least had a taste of it — it was unsettling to realize that an army of developers in Bangalore could churn out code better than I could, dollar for dollar. I had fooled myself into believing that what I was selling was so extraordinary and great that people would be begging — <em>begging!</em> — for me to deign to craft some SQL and PHP on their behalf. Such a rarified gift! Such a technical artiste!</p>
<p>When you realize that you're selling a mere commodity your ability to profit (and extract rents) from your cleverness is severely limited. It won't help to roll out an ad campaign or make the product mint-scented. You can't differentiate your product from your competitors'. It's all pretty much the same. The users can't tell the difference. All you can do is sell as much of it as you can while spending as little money as possible.</p>
<p>It's probably pretty hard to show off all of the fascinating things you learned in business school if all you're selling is bits. Rather than face this fact, the signal-deliverers choose to delude themselves and their customers. They use their existing market position to sign exclusive deals with content providers, forcing consumers to stick with Sprint if they want to see NFL highlights on their phones, or AOL if they want to hear Ted Leo cover <em>Since U Been Gone</em>, or visit <a class="reference external" href="http://www.hulu.com/">Hulu</a> if they want to watch their favorite show. They fool themselves into thinking that it isn't their lingering monopolistic power that keeps the money coming in, but rather their unique talent for both running a cable company AND reinventing Tivo, or managing the production of television series AND building a YouTube competitor. Somehow, they maintain, it just happens that the sole firm allowed to provide these services is also the one best positioned to provide them efficiently.</p>
<p>Data is now a utility, just like the gas and electric lines running into your house. The present situation is as if the gas company gave customers specialized ovens that could only heat up prepared meals bought from the utility — and refused to connect the gas line to any other kind of oven. It's ludicrous. We don't want their ovens or meals or online music portals or mobile video platforms. We just need them to get out of the way of the original signal, then shuttle the bits we ask for as cheaply as possible.</p>
<p>But if the bit-movers admitted this they'd also be admitting that they're less necessary than before — that there's going to be fewer of them, and that they're going to be making less money. That's not the sort of thing that a corporation is eager to recognize. Nor is there an advantage to being the first to recognize it: there's still good money to be made squeezing the last dregs from this dying business model, and rocking the boat will only hasten everybody's inevitable demise. Who knows, you might get lucky and make it to retirement before the whole thing collapses. Might as well give it a shot.</p>
<p>So I think Mike's proposal isn't very feasible. It's not a question of a needing a company to step forward and begin treating its customers with honesty and respect; it's a question of needing an industry to admit that it's less relevant than it used to be and quietly retire to a life of unassuming, unexciting competence. And that wouldn't be much fun at all.</p>

                    <p>Right, Halloween: it's already happened, as far as I'm concerned. I'm exhausted, haven't been to the gym in ages, and have a ton of work to finish. I intend to nod approvingly as Charles hands out the massive quantities of candy that he bought, but my holiday celebrations occurred last Saturday. I think I'm even skipping out on a fun-sounding bar outing.</p>
<p>But last weekend was pretty great. Here's a shot of me as Dr. Doom, looking disoriented:</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/1808541769/"><img alt="Doom, disoriented" class="center" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2028/1808541769_4360610e5c.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: 375px;" /></a></p>
<p>And <a class="reference external" href="http://flickr.com/photos/48199512&#64;N00/1793946986/in/set-72157602766722812/">here's</a> a shot of me fighting Galactus.</p>
<p>A few things learned during the costume construction process:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">I think Dr. Doom probably makes his own outfits. If you find yourself in possession of a lot of green fabric, an enthusiasm for diabolical technology and little to no sewing skill, a Doomesque cape and tunic combo is a not-unlikely result.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Dr. Doom's <a class="reference external" href="http://www.thesmoothdj.com/DrDoom_Head.jpg">enthusiasm for goblets</a> is born of necessity: it's really hard to hold onto a beverage while wearing gauntlets. Cupping your drink from beneath is really the only viable strategy. The fact that it looks good when paired with a menacing glower is just a happy coincidence.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><a class="reference external" href="/2007/10/11/part-of-my-halloween-costume/">Negative ion generators</a> are a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.afrotechmods.com/cheap/negativeiongenerator/pikashoe7.htm">nice</a> <a class="reference external" href="http://phrets.com/electrifried/">idea</a>, but they're also likely to stop working pretty quickly. And you need to think seriously about electrical isolation if you want to build up any kind of charge — ancient sneakers spraypainted silver (and paired with a cape that occasionally drags) are not the best way to keep voltage from leaking into the ground. I managed to give a few people pinprick shocks before the whole thing stopped working, but it mostly served to gently electrocute my right foot. Overall, it was a bit of a disappointment (although thankfully not a very expensive one).</p>
<p>But I got some late advice from Dan Rutter of DansData.com, which may be useful for aspiring Dooms:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">You might like to try buying one of those &quot;shocking&quot; lighters or pens</div>
<div class="line">that're all over eBay and joke shops these days; they're basically</div>
<div class="line">just a little Tesla coil inside, I think, and it ought to be quite</div>
<div class="line">easy to hack one into a shock-glove.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">(A friend of mine made a rather higher powered version of the same</div>
<div class="line">thing years ago, and installed it in a small project box with</div>
<div class="line">external contacts, a button, and a label that said &quot;DO NOT PRESS&quot;.</div>
<div class="line">Needless to say, people picked it up, and pressed the button, and</div>
<div class="line">sometimes then smashed themselves in the face with the box. :-)</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Sounds promising. Next year: <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electro_%28comics%29">Electro</a>?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>At any rate, here are the rest of my photos from the evening. As you might notice, there are kind of a lot of shots of a jack o'lantern sitting in front of a smoke machine's output hose. That's because this is <em>totally awesome</em> and should enthrall the lot of you the way it does me. Some people will tell you that on Saturday night I could often be found stumbling around the shrubs, fiddling with the smoke machine. More responsible accounts of the evening will reflect the fact that A) it takes a lot of work to maintain an optimally foggy environment for the enjoyment of all and B) it's pretty hard to navigate a garden while wearing a cape and cardboard armor regardless of how many beers you've just consumed.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>Mom's surgery went well. The radial nerves in her arm had to be moved, which is a bit worrisome and resulted in more post-surgical weakness than the doctors would have liked. But she's not in too much pain, and she says she can already feel that her arm is better-aligned than it was. Everyone's optimistic that with work, patience and perhaps another procedure she'll recover her full dexterity.</p>
<p>This is no great revelation, but: hospitals are depressing. Everyone is just so <em>helpless</em>. The medical staff perform a strange pantomime of patient-empowerment, offering treatment options as if they'll be met with thoughtful consideration rather than endlessly rephrased versions of &quot;what do <em>you</em> think we should do?&quot; You're at the mercy of fate, the insurance company and your own ignorance.</p>
<p>It's worse when you watch it happening to someone whom you arrogantly identify as less-equipped to make informed decisions. Although they do so gently and respectfully, the nurses' approach toward their uneducated, unhealthy and generally unlucky patients resembles nothing so much as that of an adult who unexpectedly finds himself babysitting the lost child of lawyers. They're very deferent, but their respectfulness comes from protocol, manners and professional fear rather than, y'know, respect. It's hard not to wonder what these exchanges accomplish.</p>
<p>Of course, a paternalist with even a <em>little</em> self-awareness (a title to which I aspire) can't look at this interplay for very long without realizing that he's just as enmeshed in it as any of the people around him — it's just that he has the problem of being an insufferable snob, too.</p>
<p>So I tried to put aside my pretensions and abjectly surrender myself to the situation. I stopped judging the wheelchair-bound smokers in front of the building. I watched Wheel of Fortune with interest. I listened to a sweatsuited manchild complaining to his elderly mother that the hospital firewall didn't allow him to check Britney Spears' MySpace page for news of her new album. I listened, identified, despaired.</p>
<p>Then I resumed doing what the doctors told me until I could return to a place where it's easier to forget about free will.</p>

                    <p>I'm down in Charlottesville for a couple of days, helping my mom get around as she gets some more surgery on her arm (it never quite healed properly from her motorcycle accident 15 months ago). There are a bunch of restaurants and bars that I used to frequent as an undergrad just a short walk from the hospital, and the nurses assured me that hanging around the waiting room would gain me nothing except, perhaps, a deadly staph infection. So I wandered up to the Corner, had lunch at Bodo's (now with <a class="reference external" href="http://matthewyglesias.theatlantic.com/archives/2007/05/monday_bagel_blogging.php">official Jewish approval</a> — he's matrilinear &amp; everything!) and then wandered over to Plan 9 music, where I've been sipping coffee and having very little luck using the free wireless.</p>
<p>This provides a handy excuse for why I haven't yet completed my timesheet, but it also means that I just lost an entire batch of meticulously-tagged Halloween photos when the upload died partway through. This brings me to the putative reason for this post: there's got to be something better than the OS X Flickr Uploadr, right? The goddamn thing has a single failure mode: catastrophic. I appreciate simplicity, but I kind of expected Flickr to take some of the savings it enjoys from vowel-related cost-cutting and reinvest it in software development.</p>

America America aw shucks apparently-not-diabolical. Fine. But what's this?</p>
<blockquote>
[Huckabee] tells audiences that the only soap his family could afford was the rough Lava soap, and that he was in college before he realized showering didnâ€™t have to hurt. &quot;There are people paying $150 for an exfoliation,&quot; he jokes. &quot;I could just hand them a bar of Lava soap.&quot;</blockquote>
<p>He's right about one thing: Lava soap is pretty rough. My dad often had some of their products around the house for cleaning grease off of his hands, and it was definitely not something you'd use without noticing. But that's because it's supposed to be that way — <em>it's got little bits of pumice mixed in</em>.</p>
<p>Anyway what's this bullshit about it being cheap? Lava is a highly specialized utility soap, and one would expect it to command a premium. Clearly, this calls for some internet research. I compared prices for Lava versus Irish Spring — a nice, middle-of-the-road soap used by right-thinking Americans such as myself. A NOTE ON METHODOLOGICAL RIGOR: Lava is mostly sold as single bars. On the web, Irish Spring tends to be sold in 3-packs, so I've divided its prices by the number of bars. Surely a hardscrabble, cost-conscious family like the Huckabees would've bought in bulk.</p>

<p>The best price I could find for Lava was on Amazon — if you buy the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/oz-Lava-Bar-Soap-LAVA/dp/B0002ZW79U/ref=pd_bbs_2/105-2434525-4440409?ie=UTF8&amp;s=hpc&amp;qid=1192836726&amp;sr=8-2">48-pack</a> you can get it for $0.89/bar. But that's still more expensive than retail amounts of Irish Spring, and the package is suspiciously green. If you're really looking for budget soap you can do considerably better than that. Or you could simply pass horse urine through straw and mix with lard. You <em>do</em> slaughter your own pigs, don't you?</p>
<p>So what can we conclude from all of this? I think there are two possibilities. Either Mike Huckabee is a compulsive liar and therefore completely unfit for office; or the Huckabee family has some sort of hereditary economic disability. The latter could perhaps account for his otherwise inexplicable enthusiasm for raising taxes sometimes, slightly. Either way, it's important that he be exposed for the confused old man and/or transparent fraud that he is. Has anything been done with the word &quot;Huckster&quot; yet?</p>
<p>This is the most obviously despicable campaign trail behavior since John Kerry's 2004 cheesesteak pandering. I expect the next Youtube debate to feature AT LEAST one soap-related question.</p>

                    <p>I was sitting in a not-that-eventful software development event this afternoon when I got a phone call from an unknown number. I expected this — my mom was scheduled to have some surgery tomorrow and the hospital's patient-wrangler was due to call and tell me where we needed to be and when.</p>
<p>But no! It was MPD on the line, wanting to confirm my identity and address and then informing me that Charles' and my apartment had been broken into. I think I said something off-color like &quot;oh jeez!&quot; and set off on my bike.</p>
<p>Apparently some jerk had pulled up in a plausible-looking van from a HVAC company. I guess he had tried to pry open the front door, since some of the trim had been removed and the police found a prybar in a backpack in the garbage can. But that didn't work. So he set up some not-that-official-looking cones and a ladder and used them to climb through a window.</p>
<p>The same thing happened to our neighbor Paul about a year ago. Fortunately, our neighbor Katie was home and kept an eye on the guy. She eventually decided that he looked shady enough to merit a call to the cops, who nabbed the guy as he was coming out. In his possession at the time: an iBook charger, a jar full of change and our beloved Nintendo Wii (no Wiimotes, though).</p>
<p>The cops took statements, dusted for prints, had me do a walkthrough and even gave us back our things. Throughout it all the officers and detective were friendly, professional, thorough and, in one case, kind of foxy.</p>
<p>Better yet, my mom's operation has been rescheduled. So I'm currently sitting on my couch in the sun, home from work, sipping coffee and getting ready to take care of some coding that I thought I was going to have to sprint to finish. Getting robbed is great!</p>
<p><strong>ALSO:</strong> <a class="reference external" href="http://blogstretch.blogspot.com">Amanda</a> tells me that she asked Travis Morrison my let's-say-one-eighth-joking question about his preferred Javascript library during her interview with him. Awesome. This has turned into a pretty good day.</p>

                    <p>There's a new version of the Hy/pe Mac/hine! Cool. The mp3 blog aggregator's gotten a new coat of paint and a different flash player. It looks pretty nice, although I'm not entirely sure what substantive changes have been made. Nevertheless, it's at least much more t-shirt-compatible.</p>
<p>I decided to celebrate the occasion by digging into the workings of the site a bit more. Hype/m provides a lot of music but is understandably hesitant to provide direct downloads lest they be busted by The Man. But how do you go about providing an mp3 for listening but not for saving? It's as fundamentally unsolvable as any other DRM problem — more so, given the relatively open technologies that the site uses.</p>
<p>Still, they do their best. For instance, only requests from known web browsers are allowed — try to use a command-line tool like wget or curl to fetch content and you'll get an ACCESS DENIED message. But it's easy to fake user agent strings (or just to do the dirty work within your browser). Consequently, this isn't the only security that the site employs.</p>
<p>Let's have a look at the anatomy of playing a song on hypem:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">You click the play button next to a track.</p>

<p>This code tells the browser to load an Adobe Flash object called <em>h2p.swf</em> and pass it parameters telling it A) to start playing immediately (<em>autoplay=1</em>) and B) where to find the mp3 that it should play. This is accomplished via a mysterious <em>url</em> parameter, which I've highlighted in bold in the HTML above.</p>
</li>
<li><div class="first line-block">
<div class="line">Using the <a class="reference external" href="http://livehttpheaders.mozdev.org/">LiveHTTPHeaders</a> plugin for Firefox, we can see that the flash video then requests a file named something like:</div>

<blockquote>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://hypem.com/serve/f/509/401678/f48c7f07a821a8fc528842d0bd8d3029.mp3">http://hypem.com/serve/f/509/401678/f48c7f07a821a8fc528842d0bd8d3029.mp3</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's straightforward enough. But how does it get that long URL from the even-longer <em>url</em> querystring parameter that's passed to the Flash movie?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>To find out, we've got to take a look inside the seemingly black box of the flash movie. Fortunately there's a great tool that lets us do that: <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nowrap.de/flare.html">Flare</a>, which is free, cross-platform, and will happily extract the ActionScript from a Flash movie. I grabbed the h2p.swf file and passed it to Flare. Here's the interesting part of what I got back:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="literal-block">
this.m = new mp(this, com.meychi.ascrypt.RC4.decrypt(com.meychi.ascrypt.Base64.decode(_root.url), 'abcdef1234567890'));
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Hello there... looks an awful lot like a decryption routine... and something that looks suspiciously like a decryption key! This line takes the aforementioned <em>url</em> querystring parameter, Base64-decodes it, then passes it to an RC4 decryption routine along with the decryption key <em>abcdef1234567890</em> (not the actual key). This turns the <em>url</em> parameter into a usable URL, which the flash player then fetches.</p>
<p>The meychi.ascrypt library's website is offline, but a little digging into its code (also returned by Flare) shows that, unlike most RC4 decryption libraries, it expects to receive a string of hexadecimal bytes which it first converts into a string of chars before applying the RC4 decryption algorithm. The need for this extra step had me scratching my head for a while, but eventually I figured out what was going on and cobbled together the following script to replicate the functionality. It's in Perl, since I couldn't find any RC4 routines in Ruby.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="literal-block">
#!/usr/bin/perl
use MIME::Base64;
use Crypt::RC4;
# hype mac/hine's secret encryption cipher... shhh!
$passphrase = 'abcdef1234567890';
if($src = &lt;&gt;)
{
# decode the URL-safe parameter from base64
$unencoded_src = decode_base64($src);
# convert decoded input from hexadecimal bytes to a string of chars
$charred_ciphertext = '';
while(length($unencoded_src)&gt;0)
{
$char = substr($unencoded_src, 0, 2);
$charred_ciphertext .= chr(hex($char));
$unencoded_src = substr($unencoded_src,2);
}
# decrypt with RC4 algorithm
print RC4($passphrase,$charred_ciphertext);
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Pipe the <em>url</em> querystring parameter to that script and it'll spit out the URL of the actual file. Paste that into your browser and you'll be redirected to the file's actual location — your browser will begin downloading it quite happily.</p>
<p>Of course, this is all kind of a huge pain in the ass. It's much easier to follow the link to the blog where hype/m first found the mp3 and keep your fingers crossed that the original link is still alive. But! If you could just find Javascript libraries for <a class="reference external" href="http://www.webtoolkit.info/javascript-base64.html">Base64 encoding</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://home.versatel.nl/MAvanEverdingen/Code/">RC4 decryption</a> you could make a bookmarklet or Greasemonkey script that automatically adds a direct download link to every hype/m entry. Hmmmmm.</p>
<p>Anyway, I should probably finish by saying that none of this should be taken as an indictment of the hype/m programmers' skills. The Hype Ma/chine is a truly impressive piece of software, and the countermeasures its creators have implemented to prevent direct downloading are pretty much everything I can think of doing. The problem is simply that allowing a user to hear content but not store it is an impossible task. And keeping secrets hidden in Flash — which is the only appropriate technology for this application — is similarly impossible, making whatever obfuscation they employ relatively easy to unravel.</p>
<p>The only improvement I can think to make would be to rotate encryption keys by serving a variety of different player SWFs, and invalidating an mp3's URL as soon as an incorrect key is used (I assume that the URLs produced by my script are temporary redirects that rotate fairly frequently and can be expired as necessary). This way a user couldn't cycle through the known keys. As far as I know, decompiling an SWF is not something that can be accomplished in Javascript.</p>
<p>But it probably <em>could</em> be done within a full-on Firefox plugin. And given browsers' enthusiasm for caching Flash (and Javascript's ability to easily differentiate SWFs with different names), the above proposal might not be a viable approach at all. Really, there's no way to completely secure this system. &quot;Good enough&quot; is all that one can reasonably hope for, and I think they've already achieved that.</p>

                    <p>Megan is pondering <a class="reference external" href="http://meganmcardle.theatlantic.com/archives/2007/10/the_perils_of_buy_local.php">an interesting question</a>. Apparently some contrarians have begun trying to convince her that the carbon cost of transporting non-local food is so high that the metabolic energy she expends by biking to work may come at a larger carbon cost than just taking a cab. That is, a distantly-grown apple takes so much energy to grow, produce and deliver that we'd be better off burning fossil fuels rather than expending human effort.</p>
<p>Two things. First, as Megan points out, gasoline has to be transported, too. Second, not too long ago <a class="reference external" href="http://www.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2007/07/22/the_localvores_dilemma/">Drake Bennet</a> pointed out some good reasons for wondering whether local food is actually environmentally friendly: it doesn't take too many trips to the farmer's market in a mostly-empty car for the tomato you just bought there to represent more energy use than the one shipped across an ocean in a massive container ship, then packed into a fully-loaded diesel semi.</p>
<p>But I'm still curious about how the energy use breaks down. Some figures arrived at via quick googling:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://bioenergy.ornl.gov/papers/misc/energy_conv.html">One gallon of gas contains 121 MJ of energy, or 28,920 kilocalories (1 dietary calorie = 1 kilocalorie)</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://auto.howstuffworks.com/question527.htm">A 175 lb bicyclist traveling at 15 mph expends about 34 calories per mile</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_Average_Fuel_Economy#Current_standards">The highest average fuel economy in US history was 26.2 mpg</a>. Depressingly, this occurred in 1987, according to Wikipedia.</li>
<li>Fight with Quicksilver's calculator functions a little and you get... let's see here... <em>*whirring noises*</em>... 1103.81 kilocalories per mile of travel by car.</li>
</ul>
<p>So bicycling is 32.4 times more efficient, in terms of pure energy use, than driving an average car (from 1987). Making energy by growing and harvesting food certainly takes a lot more energy than making it by pumping oil out of the ground and putting it through a fractionating column. But 32 times more per unit of produced energy? Well, maybe.</p>
<p>At any rate, the difference in locally- versus distantly-grown food seems unlikely to be the deciding factor. The real question is whether, carbon-wise, you should be making that bike ride at all, regardless of where your groceries began their journey. I can easily imagine a tomato requiring 32 times more energy to grow, harvest and deliver than it provides in food energy.</p>
<p>But who knows? It's all very confusing, and the concerned individual taking deliberate action to save the environment through carefully researched lifestyle changes seems to me to be embarking on such a crapshoot that they'll be very lucky if, when all is said and done, they've managed to even offset the carbon cost incurred by their EnergyStar LCD monitor's daily display of Treehugger.</p>

                    <p>It <em>is</em> possible to see <a class="reference external" href="http://www.news.com.au/perthnow/story/0,21598,22492511-5005375,00.html?from=mostpop">this silhouetted figure rotating in both directions</a>. Charles got it right away; yesterday I finally managed to as well. It seems extremely unlikely that the neuroscience claims attached to the demo mean anything. Still, it's a pretty neat optical illusion.</p>
<p>But I'm left wondering: did they really have to give the figure nipples?</p>
