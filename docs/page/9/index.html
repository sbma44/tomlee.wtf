                    <p>Since I have some visitors, let me note that, despite my default position of skepticism, I don't think technology's done reshaping our world -- not by any means.</p>
<p>True, across a range of disciplines, there is cause for gloom.&nbsp;Some technologies -- batteries, getting into orbit -- sure <em>look</em>&nbsp;like they're bumping up against immutable physical limits (fingers crossed that we invent flying saucers; get on it, physicists!). Others, like the speed of your home broadband connection, are hitting commercial or regulatory problems sufficiently imposing that the benefits to overcoming them don't seem worth the cost. In other cases it's a mix: growing (and arguably justified!) bureaucracy&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;depletion of low-hanging fruit <a class="reference external" href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewherper/2011/06/27/the-decline-of-pharmaceutical-researchmeasured-in-new-drugs-and-dollars/">combine to slow progress&nbsp;to a crawl</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Future societal changes related to information technology seem likely to be more about growing adoption (&quot;even poor people have smartphones&quot;; &quot;wow, they've applied the carsharing model to&nbsp;<em>that</em>?&quot;) than the deployment of new innovations (&quot;he probably misses his&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6W4CCU9M4">old glasses</a>&quot;) -- though note that this isn't actually much of a problem for human welfare if you exclude tech journalists from your analysis.</p>
<p>Certainly some of these points of stagnation will be overcome with unanticipated developments. &nbsp;And obviously I'm just as in the dark as anyone about what those innovations will be.</p>
<p>But I can guess at a couple of things -- there are a few obvious bright spots. Supplementing education, for instance: I don't know if something like Khan Academy can serve as a kind of pedagogical prosthesis, allowing a mediocre teacher to borrow some of the skills of a great one. But it at least seems plausible, and is something that's being actively figured out.</p>
<p>Maybe more whiz-bang-ishly, I'm <em>very</em>&nbsp;excited about self-driving cars. Again, this is something that's actively being worked on: not just by Google but by a number of automakers. And, somewhat shockingly, the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/250179/nevada_approves_selfdriving_cars_after_google_lobbying_push.html">early word</a> on the regulatory state's ability to adapt is not <em>completely</em>&nbsp;depressing (though I expect it to get more so).&nbsp;I realize that this might seem like a somewhat trivial technology -- certainly when I first pondered the idea I didn't understand it to be much more than a better cruise control. &nbsp;But if you haven't, let me strongly encourage you to read Tim Lee's <a class="reference external" href="http://arstechnica.com/old/content/2008/09/future-of-driving-part-1.ars">three</a> <a class="reference external" href="http://arstechnica.com/old/content/2008/10/future-of-driving-part-2.ars">part</a> <a class="reference external" href="http://arstechnica.com/old/content/2008/11/future-of-driving-part-3.ars">series</a> on what this all could mean. It's not just about playing George Jetson and watching a movie during your next road trip. Self-driving cars would free a huge amount of human capital and dramatically reduce the number of cars and supporting infrastructure that we would collectively require. &nbsp;This has implications for our cities, our environment -- even the experience of being a child or parent (a relationship that, Matt is fond of pointing out, involves a hell of a lot of chauffeur service).</p>
<p>I genuinely think this will arrive in my lifetime (pre-dotage, even! though I think <a class="reference external" href="http://timothyblee.com/2010/11/08/a-bet/">this</a> remains an excitingly uncertain bet), and that it'll be a very big deal. &nbsp;It's worth noting that it'll also be yet one more thing fueling inequality: no more truckers, no more cabbies, fewer construction and auto workers. &nbsp;This is why I think learning <a class="reference external" href="/2012/04/17/post-scarcity/">how to make peace with our new robot overlords</a>&nbsp;is so important.</p>

                    <p>Let me start by saying that I really like Alexis Madrigal's work. He's got an eye for what's new and interesting and he writes pieces that are fluid and thoughtful.</p>
<p>But it's hard for me to read <a class="reference external" href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/12/04/the-jig-is-up-time-to-get-past-facebook-and-invent-a-new-future/256046/">this</a> and not despair. He comes <em>so close</em> to the realization that a guy as smart as him ought to have already had:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I can take a photo of a check and deposit it in my bank account, then turn around and find a new book through a Twitter link and buy it, all while being surveilled by a drone in Afghanistan and keeping track of how many steps I've walked.</p>
<p>The question is, as it has always been: now what?</p>
<p>Decades ago, the answer was, &quot;Build the Internet.&quot; Fifteen years ago, it was, &quot;Build the Web.&quot; Five years ago, the answers were probably, &quot;Build the social network&quot; or &quot;Build the mobile web.&quot; And it was in around that time in 2007 that Facebook emerged as the social networking leader, Twitter got known at SXSW, and we saw the release of the first Kindle and the first iPhone. There are a lot of new phones that look like the iPhone, plenty of e-readers that look like the Kindle, and countless social networks that look like Facebook and Twitter. In other words, we can cross that task off the list. It happened.</p>
<p>What we've seen since have been evolutionary improvements on the patterns established five years ago. The platforms that have seemed hot in the last couple of years -- Tumblr, Instagram, Pinterest -- add a bit of design or mobile intelligence to the established ways of thinking. The most exciting thing to come along in the consumer space between then and now is the iPad. But despite its glorious screen and extended battery life, it really is a scaled up iPhone that offers developers more space and speed to do roughly the same things they were doing before. The top apps for the iPad look startlingly similar the top apps for the iPhone: casual games, social networking, light productivity software.</p>
<p>For at least five years, we've been working with the same operating logic in the consumer technology game. This is what it looks like:</p>
<p>There will be ratings and photos and a network of friends imported, borrowed, or stolen from one of the big social networks. There will be an emphasis on connections between people, things, and places. That is to say, the software you run on your phone will try to get you to help it understand what and who you care about out there in the world. Because all that stuff can be transmuted into valuable information for advertisers.</p>
<p>That paradigm has run its course. It's not quite over yet, but I think we're into the mobile social fin de siècle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is just an excerpt. But the whole post is pervaded by a sorrowful impatience. A sense that that all that stuff that came before was <em>okay</em>, but not quite what we were looking for, you know? It's time for something new; something that, finally, will <em>really</em> change everything.</p>
<p>A pessimist might be worried. It's <em>almost</em> as if these endless cresting waves of technical fads are never actually going to carry us beyond the threshold that we perceive but can't name -- that we won't achieve transcendence through apps, that HTML5 won't remake human nature, that meaning might be more than one more MacWorld away. That technology is only important to the extent that it lets us do things we otherwise couldn't, and that a maniacal focus on tech as a movement, beat or industry will necessarily rob it of all its vitality, leaving the obsessive observer of valuations and launches on a joyless and masturbatory trudge through the sucked-dry bones of a topic that is only worth considering in its relation to a vastly richer, larger and more important cultural landscape.</p>
<p>I mean... it could be, right? Should we at least consider the possibility?</p>
<p>Actually, no, nevermind -- whew! -- that's all wrong. Check it out, the new iPhone 5 could be AMAZING:</p>
<blockquote>
[...] I think we all better hope that the iPhone 5 has some crazy surprises in store for us later this year. Maybe it's a user interface thing. Maybe it's a whole line of hardware extensions that allow for new kinds of inputs and outputs. I'm not sure what it is, but a decently radical shift in hardware capabilities on par with phone--&gt;smartphone or smartphone--&gt;iPhone would be enough, I think, to provide a springboard for some new ideas.</blockquote>
<p>Also, lightbulbs:</p>
<blockquote>
I have some [ideas] of my own, too. The cost of a lumen of light is dropping precipitously; there must be more things than lightbulbs that can benefit from that.</blockquote>
<p>That could be a thing, right? Lightbulbs as a platform, man. You go email the alumni list for a technical cofounder, I'll start working on the pitch deck. Do you think we should do it Ignite style or aim for more of a TEDx thing?</p>
<p>And don't forget Big Data. No, we still have no idea what problems we actually want to solve with it (all human disease? let's discuss in Campfire). But check it out, I found an amazing Stack Overflow thread about building a software RAID array out of EBSes. Once we spend a couple hundred bucks on an Elastic MapReduce run, how could we <em>not</em> have fundamentally improved our civilization? It's inconceivable!</p>
<blockquote>
There's vast amounts of databases, real-world data, and video that remains unindexed. Who knows what a billion Chinese Internet users will come up with? The quantified self is just getting going on its path to the programmable self. And no one has figured out how to do augmented reality in an elegant way.</blockquote>
<p>Anyway, thank goodness. <a class="reference external" href="/2012/03/14/technology-and-humility/">For a second there I was worried</a>.</p>

                    <p><a class="reference external" href="http://earlywarn.blogspot.com/2012/04/global-robot-population.html">Robots are coming to take our jobs</a>!</p>
<p>It's funny: I tend to be skeptical about expansive visions of technological transformation. Our human impulses keep the reality that actually unfolds quaintly venal and simple-minded. Douglas Adams remains my favorite guide to the future. But I do think this could be a real problem.</p>
<p>Americans' physical needs have been pretty well met for a while now. It sure looks like more and more people are hitting a ceiling on the marginal utility of their dollars. And there haven't been any hugely popular new product categories for decades -- no flying cars, no medical breakthroughs that add decades to life. Just steadily better and cheaper consumer goods, and the debut of various useful but negligibly expensive information technology gadgets. I'm starting to actually believe I could outlive scarcity (in America, anyway).</p>
<p>I am much less gloomy about what we do after that point than Mr. Staniford seems to be. Robots might take a lot of work away from us, but I can't imagine a future where they take all the <em>meaningful</em> work. Ever been in a nursing home? A mental health facility? An underperforming school? If we really find ourselves with more resources than we know what to do with, applying them toward minimizing human suffering strikes me as a pretty worthwhile project, and one that could occupy an almost arbitrarily large number of people.</p>
<p>Or we could just have everyone spend their days carving elaborate friezes onto our public infrastructure. Hell, let's build some new pyramids! I don't know! But I am increasingly suspicious that how we redirect our surplus resources will be the central moral and political problem of the next few generations. No joke: this is why I'm trying to convince Yglesias to write his next book about the economics of Star Trek. Barring some deeply unsettling discoveries about physics, we're not going to see replicators or holodecks arrive anytime soon. But it's probably the most widely-known fictional work that even occasionally addresses this problem, which makes it seem like as good a framing device as any.</p>
<p>Or, perhaps more plausibly, we might have an ecological or epidemiological catastrophe that causes the collapse of global civilization. In which case we can probably just ignore these questions and enjoy the time we have left.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I realized I should've linked to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2012/04/05/slouching_toward_utopia.html">this post</a> by Yglesias; for how short it is, it really covers an incredible amount of territory. &nbsp;Better still, I finally got around to reading <a class="reference external" href="http://jacobinmag.com/winter-2012/four-futures/">the Peter Frase essay</a> it links to, which is shockingly good (and includes the trenchant Star Trek analysis I crave). And that, in turn, links to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2011/10/a-cultural-experiment.html">this Charles Stross blog post</a>, which is also very good.</p>

                    <p>A <a class="reference external" href="https://cyberspying.eff.org/">campaign opposing the legislation</a> launched about three minutes ago -- Sunlight is among the signatories. &nbsp;It's going to be interesting to see how this works out:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Will CISPA come to fully carry the &quot;new SOPA&quot; framing that advocates (intoxicated by the overwhelming success of that earlier campaign) are going to be unable to resist suggesting?</li>
<li>Will that be productive, or will the net bloc feel that it's being manipulated and disengage?</li>
<li>Can organization of this constituency succeed without the support of the net's commercial entities? &nbsp;By most accounts they're indifferent to CISPA in a way they weren't with SOPA.</li>
</ul>
<p>All I can tell you is that people who who have spent years promising that the internet will transform our democracy* are <em>very</em>&nbsp;excited about how the SOPA/PIPA fight went down -- and with good reason! It was a thunderous victory by all accounts. The people who have been quietly toiling in this arena feel that they might have discovered a new weapon, and the temptation to try to use it soon will no doubt prove&nbsp;irresistible.</p>
<p>Normally, trying to clone a successful campaign action is a recipe for disappointment. &nbsp;But it really is true that reflexive opposition to everything Congress tries to do to the internet is a pretty sound policy rule of thumb; there's an online constituency with vague political preferences but a strong sense of net territoriality and disillusionment with Washington; and the business communities who are most interested in mucking with the internet aren't really set up to run successful campaigns against an engaged public opposition (these guys are used to getting their way because there's basically no one paying attention on the other side).</p>
<p>So we'll see!</p>
<p>*&nbsp;in more inspiring ways than opening up a bunch of small donor money or boring, non-cutting edge (or just uninterestingly egalitarian) things like enabling constituent communication, I mean</p>

<p>With the internetty part of SXSW well behind me, it seems like a good time to talk a bit more about the state of our community (if it can be called such a thing) and its origin myths.</p>
<p>It <em>seems</em> as though disillusionment and cynicism are growing within our ranks. Alex Payne <a class="reference external" href="http://al3x.net/2012/03/06/tech-criticism.html">does a nice job</a> rounding up some examples. As noted here recently, it's difficult to separate this sense from the process of growing older (Alex is not much younger than me). Still, I perceive it to be a real shift. I think there are specific reasons for it, and that its arrival was inevitable.</p>
<p>It's an axiom of internet true-belief that things will get <em>faster</em>. Mostly, this is true. Moore's Law is habitually misstated, but even when the details are mangled the speaker's point often remains defensible. Digital technology really does get cheaper in a hurry, and this has real consequences for its reach and impact on our lives. Faith in this ceaseless acceleration reaches its apotheosis in the idea of the Singularity, an <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity#History_of_the_idea">long-nascent</a> idea popularized by Ray Kurzweil, which posits that technological change will reach a velocity beyond which meaningful predictions about human society are impossible to make. Many people guess that this will involve mind-uploading, but the point is really just that we won't be able to anticipate the true nature of the silicon godhead. Kurzweil was at SXSW, but I can assure you that he wasn't the only person in Austin hoping/expecting that his mind will live forever in a machine or otherwise achieve technological transcendence.</p>
<p>Many find this faith in technological acceleration to be cheering, but it's got some problems. Perhaps most importantly, it ignores the reality of diminishing marginal utility. Put simply: useful interventions tend to get less useful as you apply more of them to a problem. Digital technology can do a lot of things, and its declining cost means it will do more and more of them. But it's important to realize that many of the things it could do but didn't back when it was more expensive <em>weren't done because they weren't worth the expense</em>.</p>
<p>My toothbrush has a microprocessor in it; it's great, and it only cost me $50 or so. It times my brushing and it ramped up the strenuousness of its sonic ministrations when I first began using it. Two decades ago, no such toothbrush was available. Why? There are a number of possible explanations. Perhaps the technology didn't exist? No, that's not right, it certainly did. Perhaps the toothbrush makers of the past were less clever than the folks gathered in Austin? No -- that seems improbable, or at least egotistical. I think a better explanation is simply that, at the time, the advantages of a microprocessor-enabled toothbrush didn't justify the expense of building it. The expense diminished, so now we have them. But it's the costs that fell; the utility has remained static, and meager. This is strictly long-tail stuff.</p>
<p>Put another way: the most urgent uses for a technology will be addressed first. That's the beauty of markets. But a consequence is that, during a given technological milieu, engineers will generally find themselves working on tasks that increasingly seem trivial.</p>
<p>I don't think developers should be discouraged by this, but I suspect that many of them will be. That's too bad. There's no shame in doing honest work for honest pay. I've argued before that <a class="reference external" href="/2010/11/27/software-development-is-a-trade/">software development is a trade</a> comparable to carpentry. I still think that's about right. Building someone a home may not be &quot;innovative&quot;, but it's a necessary and important thing. There will always be meaningful work that needs to be done, and, if you pursue work that is especially difficult or neglected by the marketplace, even work that is novel and exciting.</p>
<p>For what it's worth, I don't think that ours is the first engineering discipline that's had to go through this process. You only have to look at the automobile-triumphalist designs of Corbusier to understand how easily the early returns to an invention can be incorrectly projected into the future (in many such cases we should be happy to have gotten away with disappointment rather than <a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNBr6de7TD4">outright disaster</a>). Similarly crazed optimism affected observers looking forward to a future full of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.neatorama.com/2011/01/23/thomas-edisons-1911-predictions-for-2011/">steel</a>, supersonic flight, <a class="reference external" href="http://radiographics.rsna.org/content/24/2/544.fullxray-mania-F3-large">radiography</a> and who knows how many other unhelpfully applied technologies.</p>
<p>Now, I shouldn't overstate all of this; I don't want to claim that Progress Is Over just because people at SXSW are self-congratulatory dopes. So two caveats. First, it would be a mistake to think that diminishing returns to digital technology means social progress in this realm must be <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Great-Stagnation-Low-Hanging-Eventually/dp/0525952713/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1332605996&amp;sr=8-1">stagnating</a>. Marginal utility declines, but computational power ascends. Individuals are able to perceive the slope of either of these functions and use it to fuel their sense of utopianism or malaise. But to know whether society as a whole is slowing down would require combining the two, which would require more fully characterizing them, and only particularly learned econometricians are wise or foolish enough to attempt that sort of thing.</p>
<p>Second, I dropped the phrase &quot;for a given technological milieu&quot; a couple of paragraphs back, but I'm asking it to do a <em>lot</em> of work. It seems likely that there are thresholds to technological progress at which discontinuities occur -- <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence">emergence</a>, they call it. Adoption of smartphones, for instance, seems to have mostly been a question of a better kind of telephone/PIM getting cheaper and cheaper, but once <em>everyone</em> has a network node with a flexible UI on them at all times, it seems likely that huge social benefits will emerge that weren't a consideration in the initial consumer-adoption calculus. But more on this in another post (one that will probably have the word &quot;innovation&quot; in it an embarrassing number of times).</p>
<p>To retreat to my point: I think that in IT, especially, we have a tendency to get confused about whether we're building a locomotive or inventing the steam engine. It's a willful confusion, it's driven by vanity, and it's now leading to disappointment -- and will do so all the more as we find we have enough locomotives on hand.</p>

                    <p>Since I might have your renewed attention, briefly (&quot;but I thought this RSS feed was broken&quot;), and since I'm already frantically promoting it on Twitter, let me draw your attention to <a class="reference external" href="http://sunlightlabs.com/blog/2012/open-states-50/">this morning's announcement from Sunlight's Open States team</a>. &nbsp;In short: we've got a new mobile app, and our services now support all fifty states (plus DC and Puerto Rico).</p>
<p>Getting to fifty is a big deal, and I'm extremely proud of Sunlight and the Open States team for reaching this milestone. &nbsp;No one's done this before; it took us years to do it ourselves.&nbsp;This data existed, but in a completely piecemeal manner -- there was no consistent location, API or data model. Getting it collected, cleaned and accessible will have real impacts for journalists, watchdogs and citizens. &nbsp;If you saw <a class="reference external" href="http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/2012/virginia-ultrasound-law-image-few-others/">Sunlight's recent work on mandatory ultrasound legislation</a> -- well, suffice it to say that there's much more coming on that front, and Open States is what's going to make it possible.</p>
<p>This was a huge&nbsp;undertaking -- honestly, I don't think anyone knew if creating and maintaining a legislative data collection architecture pulling from so many disparate sources would even be possible when we started. It's a tremendous testament to the contributors and developers who've made this possible, and the leadership of my colleague James Turk in particular. &nbsp;Nice job, you guys.</p>

<p>Apropos of nothing, during preparation for the panel I discovered that the Census TIGER/LINE GIS dataset has a logo, and it's totally awesome:</p>

                    <p>Anil Dash is on stage right now talking with Nick Denton about a variety of different things, including the failed 2011 Gawker-wide redesign which, if you remember, was going to Change Webdesign Forever and then didn't. (Don't worry, I'm sure Pinterest's look will echo through the ages.)</p>
<p>More to the nominal point of the session, this is from Denton:</p>
<blockquote>
&quot;The idea of capturing the intelligence of the readership [now] sounds like a joke.&quot;</blockquote>
<p>This strikes me as right, and completely at odds with the optimistic, inclusive, democratic vision of our networked future that dominated SXSW in 2007. &nbsp;But I think it's true, and basically compatible with the (admittedly ugly) view I expressed back <a class="reference external" href="/2010/02/11/thoughts-on-buzz/">here</a>, in which part of new sites'/network's success hangs on their ability to attract early adopting elites who are genuinely <em>better</em>&nbsp;at the internet than the general online population (which arrives later, bringing advertiser dollars and ruin).</p>
<p>The net really is&nbsp;more democratic than other mediums. But that doesn't mean it's egalitarian, it just means the gating/sorting mechanism is (arguably) based on less arbitrary/unfair personal attributes than other parts of our society. &nbsp;This is about as Randian an opinion as you're likely to get out of me, but as far as I can tell it's true.</p>
<p>Denton went on to opine that democratic moderation of comments doesn't produce interesting content because it suppresses minority views; and expressed the view that anonymity is essential to both the production and consumption of Gawker's content. &nbsp;Which again, all seems right to me, though it's a little bit sad.</p>
<p><strong>MORE PROSAICALLY:</strong> Denton mentions that Gawker doesn't have some super-secret or cutting-edge analytics platform. Editors use different things -- all commercial -- based on their own preferences and priorities. &nbsp;Which makes me feel better about my general lack of interest in these tools (beyond the basics).</p>

                    <p>I'm at SXSW, and rather than tweeting about it incessantly, I think maybe I'll just post some things here.</p>
<p>I suspect that my mood will improve with the weather and after eating some tacos, but right now SXSW is a very alienating experience. &nbsp;I was last at this conference in 2007, with a bunch of people from EchoDitto. &nbsp;Emily and I had just started dating. Twitter launched here that year, and although I never thought it'd take off the way it has, it did immediately feel like something special -- maybe it would only ever be used by the kinds of people there in Austin, but for us it would be a new, enriching layer on top of reality. I was thrilled and amazed at what technology could mean and by this new, fascinating class of people who seemed to believe -- quite earnestly and intensely -- hunches about the future that I had secretly harbored but been half-embarrassed to express. I'd never known these people were real, but now I was really one of them and <em>everything</em> was going to come true.</p>
<p>That feels very far away right now. &nbsp;The weather's worse, and there are way too many people -- they're everywhere, all the panels and shuttles and bars are bursting. &nbsp;They're the same kinds of people, but by now everybody's settled on the same dream -- the mad-lib details vary, but the basic story is about startups and a kind of &quot;innovation&quot; that seems indistinguishable from a dreary march toward the combinatorial exhaustion of the current technological landscape's possibilities.</p>
<p>I'm older, and it's easier to see the contours of feasibility and to recognize how many of those dreams are unworkable or ill-advised or just mundane. &nbsp;Websockets are a great technology, but they're going to change interfaces, not lives, you know? &nbsp;Real-time data and self-quantification are interesting and will be useful in a few domains, but reality is not as procedural and deterministic as programmers' minds; most of these speculative possibilities will not pan out, even after we've built the dehumanizing foundations necessary to really put automated Taylorism through its paces and see what it can do. &nbsp;There is a terrifying amount of talk about cognitive psychology results, and I'm starting to think that the actually-quite-limited predictive power of these models at an individual level is the only thing that can possibly save us from people like my twentysomething year-old self.</p>
<p>Well. &nbsp;Like I said: tacos are indicated. &nbsp;In a moment, off to the airport to pick up a rental car and escape the shuttles. Later: panels from activists, journalists and political folks, which I think will be both less inspiring and less frightening, both of which strike me as healthy things.</p>

                    <p>Today's coordinated action in opposition to SOPA/PIPA by the internet community is something that's both heartening and inspiring. &nbsp;Its volume--despite a lack of coverage that should deeply embarrass the traditional media--and the speed with which it's prompting legislators to reverse position are both impressive. &nbsp;It could easily turn out to be remembered as the moment when &quot;the internet&quot; emerged not just as a political force but as a political constituency.</p>
<p>Still, those pointing out that today's site blackouts are corporate speech are not wrong. &nbsp;And this community's ability to call what amounts to a general strike is more than a little worrisome, at least in principle. &nbsp;The country is ever-more reliant on web companies to conduct normal business, but it has gotten into this position without entering into contractual arrangements with those companies. &nbsp;The nature of information technology's ability to scale means that the decision to deny web service will often rest in relatively few hands (with the exception of explicitly communal projects like Reddit and Wikipedia). &nbsp;This all makes me at least a little bit uneasy.</p>
<p>In practice I suspect it'll all be fine: there aren't a lot of issues with the positive optics of speech rights; and the mass net movement around SOPA/PIPA really has originated with the grassroots. &nbsp;I don't think this kind of campaign would be thinkable for web companies without some genuine democratic underpinnings to support it.</p>
<p>Still, all of this positive activist energy would be much less charming if it were being directed toward sales tax amnesty or another one of the web startup community's harebrained political priorities.</p>

                    <p>I take it that <a class="reference external" href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/victory_lab/2012/01/project_dreamcatcher_how_cutting_edge_text_analytics_can_help_the_obama_campaign_determine_voters_hopes_and_fears_.html">this</a> is what the Obama campaign <a class="reference external" href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0711/Obama_campaign_hiring_data_mining_scientists.html">was hiring</a> &quot;data scientists&quot; to do. &nbsp;It's an interesting project, but I think the Slate writeup fails to make a few important connections.</p>
<p>First: how likely is it that the campaign actually needs a new method of gauging supporters' opinions and priorities? Not very, I'd say. Surveys and focus groups are well-developed methodologies that don't suffer from the obvious selection effect problems that a &quot;share your story&quot; feature on a website does.</p>
<p>Second: pay attention the the bits of the article recounting&nbsp;Rayid Ghani's resume. The work he did for Accenture sounds legit -- applying classic machine learning techniques to product classification and sales projections. &nbsp;But how much of it dealt with expressed opinion (&quot;share your story&quot;) versus observed behavior (&quot;was this product purchased?&quot;). &nbsp;The answer: lots of the latter, none of the former.</p>
<p>And this is important. By themselves, personal expressions are not terrifically useful. People don't know their own minds all that well. But personal expressions can be a useful signal when correlated with objective observations.</p>
<p>I think &quot;[this project is]&nbsp;about us being better listeners&quot; is an pretty generous gloss on what's being done here. The odds of this being an input to the platform or priorities of an incumbent president's campaign seem certain to be low.</p>
<p>I expect that the campaign is using this corpus of personal essays to classify supporters into better-segmented subgroups, so that more specifically customized appeals can be made to them. It's conceivable that this will be deployed for GOTV efforts, but that's a tricky experiment to run since you only get to do a trial once every few years. &nbsp;More likely this is about fundraising, with classic A/B testing used to hone the model and refine the system of segmentations and corresponding appeals. If that approach delivers better results than existing methods, they'll try to use whatever demographic characteristics are available in the voterfile to segment potential supporters who haven't helpfully supplied personal essays (&quot;he's a middle-aged white guy from Detroit--put him in the 'the bailouts worked' email group&quot;). Whether you can generalize from someone engaged enough to contribute a &quot;share your story&quot; entry to someone who isn't seems like a big if, but hey, it's worth a shot.</p>
<p>That's my guess, anyway. None of this is nefarious; it's just what campaigns do. &nbsp;But I think it's important for people to understand that, rather than a triumph of democracy-enabling technology, this is just a quantitative approach to squeezing even more money out of voters and into our political system. &nbsp;It's necessary work, but I wouldn't say it's exactly noble work.&nbsp;If you want your political opinion to shift the policy needle, you should probably start by calling or writing your representatives, not by pouring your heart out to barackobama.com.</p>

                    <p>I've been playing with <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Color-Effects-Changing-Remote-Control/dp/B004A354B8">these holiday lights</a> recently. They're very neat: each bulb has RGB LEDs embedded in it and is individually addressable (albeit with only 4 bits of resolution per color channel). Some wonderfully talented folks have <a class="reference external" href="http://www.deepdarc.com/2010/11/27/hacking-christmas-lights/">reverse-engineered</a> the protocol that the light controller uses; <a class="reference external" href="http://scottrharris.blogspot.com/2010/12/controlling-ge-color-effects-lights.html">others have written Arduino code</a> making it possible to snip the light's control line, connect it to an Arduino, and begin programming your own animations. Still others are doing various <a class="reference external" href="http://blog.jgc.org/2011/11/turning-ge-color-effects-g-35-christmas.html">neat and unusual things</a> with the result. Personally, I just want to have some interesting light displays for New Year's.</p>
<p>These other folks' work makes this possible, but not as convenient as it could be: developing new animation routines on the Arduino is a pain in the butt. To do so you write your code in the Arduino's irritating development environment, then flash it to the chip and hope that everything worked right. There's a small risk of damaging the lights, and a large chance of things going wrong.</p>
<p>So! I wrote some bridge code that moves the light control logic into Python, which can run and be manipulated on a regular ol' computer. The state of the lights is then sent to the Arduino many times per second (though not as many as I'd like -- still, only about 1FPS slower than the string's theoretical max) and the Arduino dutifully updates the state of the lights. This should make development of animations easier, and make it simpler to trigger or modulate them in response to network events or other things that the computer can detect.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/sbma44/cheerlights-arduino-python">If you have any use for this code, you can find it here</a>. For me, there are two challenges remaining: creating some interesting animations, and connecting a second string to the Arduino.</p>
<p>This latter issue is a bigger problem than you might think: the lights' address space is only 6 bits -- too small to simply connect the two strings together and retain the ability to control individual lights (bulbs can share addresses, but I'd rather not do that). So the two strings need to be treated as individual entities. That's easy enough on the Arduino side. But the Arduino is going to live at one end of this double-string, not in the middle. That means that the signal to the far string will have to be transmitted along the length of the near string. This is too much distance for a fast serial connection to traverse without being spread out into illegibility.</p>
<p>The solution, I'm told, is to shift the serial signal to RS-422, a higher-speed and more ethernet-like standard, then back to serial at the light string (it will travel along a twisted pair of conductors that I'll run along the already-too-heavy first string). I have the chips to do this, and it all *looks* pretty simple. Fingers crossed...</p>

                    <p>I just spent some time banging my head against this problem; let me save people wandering in from Google similar trouble.</p>
<p>So: you're trying to use pySerial to speak to your Arduino. It's not working. Or sometimes it is, but only when you have the Arduino Serial Monitor window open! This makes no sense.</p>
<p>Here's the deal: the Arduino's fancy &quot;you can flash new programs onto me without pressing my reset button!&quot; functionality works by resetting the damn thing whenever a new serial connection is made. With the serial monitor open, the connection's already open, so no reset happens and your script might actually work. When the monitor is closed, the Arduino resets when Python connects to it -- and the Arduino might still be busy booting up when your script begins shoving bits across the link.</p>
<p>So! You can disable this auto-reset behavior (you'll have to ask the Arduino people about that), but it seems simplest to just make your python script long-running and wait patiently for a beat or two after opening the serial link. Here's a dead-simple example:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">[cc lang=&quot;python&quot;]import serial, sys</div>
<div class="line">from time import sleep</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">SERIAL_PORT = '/dev/tty.usbmodem621'</div>
<div class="line">SERIAL_RATE = 9600</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">ser = serial.Serial(SERIAL_PORT, SERIAL_RATE)</div>
<div class="line">sleep(2)</div>
<div class="line">val = int(sys.argv[1])</div>
<div class="line">ser.write(chr(val))[/cc]</div>
</div>
<p>Here's the Arduino sketch. It just blinks the LED on pin 13 however many times you sent as a byte (I'm working on sending binary-ish data over the serial link; hence the use of raw byte values):</p>
<p>[cc lang=&quot;java&quot;]byte inByte = 0;</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">void setup()</div>
<div class="line">{</div>
<div class="line">Serial.begin(9600);</div>
<div class="line">pinMode(13, OUTPUT);</div>
<div class="line">}</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">void loop()</div>
<div class="line">{</div>
<div class="line">if (Serial.available() &gt; 0) {</div>
<div class="line">inByte = Serial.read();</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">for(int i=0;i digitalWrite(13, HIGH);</div>
<div class="line">delay(500);</div>
<div class="line">digitalWrite(13, LOW);</div>
<div class="line">delay(500);</div>
<div class="line">}</div>
<div class="line">}</div>

                    <p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2011/12/18/rich_people_are_politically_active.html">This</a> is more or less why I don't spend a ton of time at work worrying about the digital divide. &nbsp;It's tempting to tell yourself that the reason politically marginalized populations don't avail themselves of their representatives' attention is that they lack access to the necessary technologies. &nbsp;If only you could write your senator through an SMS interface instead of needing an expensive, Javascript-capable smartphone!</p>
<p>But of course this is nonsense. &nbsp;To a first approximation every American can afford to use the telephone and the post office. And in urban and suburban areas, at least, libraries make computers widely available. &nbsp;What marginalized people lack is time, attention and education. &nbsp;Maybe they don't have a cellular data plan either, but first things first. &nbsp;Besides, to the extent that technology access <em>is</em>&nbsp;a real problem,&nbsp;falling electronics prices are likely to do much more to address the issue than even the most conscientiously designed interfaces (on this score, the news on smartphone penetration is <a class="reference external" href="http://blog.nielsen.com/nielsenwire/online_mobile/generation-app-62-of-mobile-users-25-34-own-smartphones/">very encouraging</a>).</p>
<p>Still, just because projects that concentrate on technological deficits are focusing on a small and relatively unimportant part of a dauntingly large problem doesn't mean that such efforts aren't laudable. &nbsp;There's always room for making a difference at the margin. &nbsp;And there's something to be said for principle. &nbsp;Designing our work to be inclusive and truly democratic is important -- sometimes more important than maintaining a depressingly realistic appraisal of our chances for coding our way to egalitarianism.</p>
<p>(I should probably add that I think creating accessible interfaces for politically engaged populations that have difficulty using technology -- the disabled, seniors, etc -- is a very different endeavor from the broader/gloomier digital divide issue)</p>
