                    <p>Well, I'm back. I brought with me a tan, a briefly-broken camera, five new pounds of body fat and a profound sense of bewilderment at having <a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/medildo/sets/72157600306784210/">missed my college reunion</a>.</p>
<p>Not that I would have gone — it would have been nice to see old friends, but I wouldn't have wanted to leave my vacation early. But I'm a little miffed that I didn't heard a peep about it from UVA. I guess they don't bother keeping track of you if you don't join the alumni association — something that I refused to do, despite many lame entreaties. &quot;Free Burrito Dinner!&quot; they'd proclaim, &quot;You just have to join the alumni association!&quot;</p>
<p>A delicious burrito did sound pretty good at the time. But since the deal basically amounted to $250/burrito, I declined. Admittedly, I wouldn't have had to make any payments for several years (it's the burrito interest that kills you). But the sense that someone was trying to trick me in an insultingly stupid way led me to foreswear the alumni association permanently. Hence: no reunion mailings.</p>
<p>I'm much happier to have spend that time at the beach, anyway. And there are pictures! My own collection is a little truncated, both due to apathy and to sand getting into my camera partway through the trip, making it unable to focus on anything. A little zooming in and out seems to have dislodged the wayward grain, though, and everything's okay again. Here are the ones I managed to snap before that happened:</p>

                    <p>Tonight we play miniature golf. This has been on the beach-agenda every year, but this year's staying-the-whole-week innovation makes it look like it's finally going to happen. I'm pretty excited; I consider mini-golf to be an important part of the beach experience.</p>
<p>Still, there is a looming question that must be answered before we can take to the astroturf and do battle:</p>
<p><em>Dinosaur or Pirate Ship?</em></p>
<p>Don't mistake zaniness for a lack of profundity. This isn't just about which family fun center would make for the better putt-putt experience. This is about what society and human fellowship mean to you — what you hope they could mean.</p>
<p><em>Dinosaur or Pirate Ship?</em></p>
<p>Keep saying it until it's almost a zen koan. Dinosaur or Pirate Ship? There may not be an answer, but this does not excuse you from seeking one.</p>
<p><em>Dinosaur or Pirate Ship.</em></p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Pirate Ship.</p>

                    <p>Alright, so there haven't been any <em>particularly</em> noteworthy hijinks so far. That's okay. I feel relaxed, loaded up on vitamin D, and as if creativity is beginning to seep back into my brain. Or perhaps that's just the sensation of the juniper deposits left by all the gin.</p>
<p>Either way, things are going great. My only complaint so far: deadly sea creatures.</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/518107351/"><img alt="this fish is an ASSHOLE" class="center" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/189/518107351_58e49d8853_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 180px;" /></a></p>
<p>It's a little hard to see, but this is a dead pufferfish. Evolution has graced him with highly effective camouflage, allowing him to trick his prey into stepping on him, then cursing.</p>
<p>The fact that he's A) too small to eat me and B) dead brings the effectiveness of this hunting technique into question, but I'm sure nature will iron things out in another eon or two. In the meantime, he did manage to draw some blood:</p>

<p>But between my vacationmates' sunburns and other miscellaneous ailments, I'm still doing relatively well at dealing with the beach's terrible toll.</p>

                    <p>I am, let's face it, a little hungover. The City Veins show last night was a lot of fun, but the accompanying revelry has left me a little worse for wear. I've already consumed a number of pills of some sort and waited patiently for someone to make me some coffee, but it appears that too many of my coworkers are off doing less important things (e.g. meeting with clients) for this to happen on its own. I still feel lousy.</p>
<p>This leaves food as the only possible solution. But my office staples of corn muffins, yogurt and fruit are at a calculated pre-beach ebb. I would have to get up and leave the office.</p>
<p>But there is this:</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/513497449/"><img alt="Canadian Maple Syrup" class="center" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/211/513497449_9b6a1b92df_m.jpg" style="width: 180px; height: 240px;" /></a></p>
<p>I could do it. I could drink this recently-acquired bottle of maple syrup.</p>
<p>It's really sugary — it'd probably even work.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>I <em>do</em> really like maple syrup.</p>

<p>I really am looking forward to this. These guys have been playing together for a while now — it'll be interesting to see the evolution from their Velvet Lounge debut to tonight. Plus, Adam says they have a bunch of new material. Even if they didn't, the stuff from their band-creating LP sounds newly great since being rerecorded. I particularly like this one:</p>
<blockquote>
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.thecityveins.com/music/ToeTheLine.mp3">The City Veins – Toe The Line</a></blockquote>
<p>I think it's one of the best songs (and most tastefully restrained performances) I've ever heard from these guys in any of the various band incarnations they've been in. You can find more of the rerecorded album <a class="reference external" href="http://www.thecityveins.com/blog/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Oh, and if anyone feels like joining us for dinner on H Street before the show, send me an email. Otherwise, I hope to see you at the show.</p>

<p><strong>SECOND</strong> EchoDitto had its big three year anniversary party on the Odyssey dinner cruise thingy, and it was as great a time as you would expect of an event with an open bar.

                    <p>Philadelphia's alt-weeklies are awash in she-males.</p>
<p>You only need to open up the Weekly or City Paper classifieds to find them. You might not see them at first, but they're right in front of your nose: it's just that there are so many of them that you might not notice. In fact, the default setting for prostitutes in these pages is ambidrogenous. Ladies of the night offering boring ol' hetero sex are compelled to add &quot;100% Female!&quot; to their ads so that customers know what they're getting.</p>
<p>Of course there's nothing wrong with this sort of thing, aside from the basic illegality of prostitution. Your sex life is your own business in a properly enlightened, liberal society. Still, it seems as though the market's interest in these strangely half-gendered individuals hints at a deeply repressed or conflicted sexuality that must be fairly widespread.</p>
<p>Besides which, it seems clear that the services on offer are particularly filthy. Most of the ads include a line saying there are &quot;X reasons you should call me&quot;, where X is a number ranging from around 7 to well over a dozen. Presumably this refers to the menu of sexual acts on offer. But my laughably naive schoolboy mind struggles to fill it out with monetizable sex acts. I can only complete the list by including services that are either deeply unwise or thoroughly implausible.</p>
<p>All in all, it paints a seedy picture of the city — one that must be embarrassing to its residents.</p>
<p>Still, it <a class="reference external" href="http://dceiver.blogspot.com/2007/05/at-last-city-paper-goes-crazy-on-murray.html">could be worse</a>.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>Last week I used Viktor Mayer-SchÃ¶nberger's <a class="reference external" href="http://www.vmsweb.net/attachments/pdf/Useful_Void.pdf">&quot;Useful Void&quot; proposal</a> (PDF) as a jumping-off point to ruminate about Facebook, the work/personal divide and darknets over <a class="reference external" href="/2007/05/10/the-internet-like-an-electronic-elephant/">here</a>. Along the way I casually dismissed Mayer-SchÃ¶nberger's proposal:</p>
<blockquote>
I'm sure his heart is in the right place, but this is dumb for all the same reasons that DRM is dumb. You really, really can't control the spread or persistence of publicly available digital information. Efforts to do so are a waste of everyone's time.</blockquote>
<p>But then, much to my surprise, the man himself popped up in comments, leaving this polite note:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">You seem to suggest that my proposal is similar to IP secured by DRM. It seems that you haven't actually looked at my paper. In the paper I suggest that a DRM-like approach (as Lessig has made in Code 2.0) would be overkill. What I desire is not perfect solution, just a shift in defaults that makes users think again about the choice of forgetting.</div>
<div class="line">I encourage you to read the paper - it's a free download, including from my <a class="reference external" href="http://www.vmsweb.net/">website</a>, and I think addresses some of the concerns you seem to have.</div>
<div class="line">In contrast your solution (cognitively accepting the fact that we are transparent and thus weigh things differently) depends on our brains ability to adapt - not something that cognitive scientists have much hope in I am afraid, espcially since biologically we are wired to forget.</div>
<div class="line">Kind regards,</div>
<div class="line">VMS</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, guilty as charged — I hadn't read his proposal. But now I have, and I'm afraid that I still arrive at much the same conclusion: I think that it probably isn't workable, and it definitely wouldn't be wise.</p>
<p>His proposal specifically involves the legislative mandating of a system of expiration metadata that would be built into software. It could be easily overridden by data creators when necessary — your Word documents won't start disappearing — but by default data would be &quot;forgotten&quot; after a set period of time.</p>
<p>But how did we get into the situation we're currently in, with huge amounts of data being acquired? As Mayer-SchÃ¶nberger points out, storage is very cheap. But it's not free — data is still retained for one of two reasons: either people assign <em>value</em> to the data, or the costs associated with throwing it away (and sifting out what shouldn't be thrown away) exceed the cost of storing it.</p>
<p>The proposal may help with the second situation. Introducing statutory penalties raises the cost of retaining data, which may spur organizations to throw it away. Of course, the cost of throwing away data isn't made any cheaper by the system, but presumably Mayer-SchÃ¶nberger thinks it's worthwhile to introduce that inefficiency.</p>
<p>The first situation is unlikely to be helped, however. If a user assigns value to a piece of data — i.e. they think it's useful or may become useful in the future — there's very little that one can do to stop them from retaining it indefinitely. Data doesn't just delete itself, after all. To make sure it disappears at a set time you can do one of two things: either design a system that simply refuses to read a piece of data after the expiration date, or one that actively collects and deletes content on or near the expiration date. The first option involves per-use permissioning — simply put, it's DRM, and just as difficult to implement effectively. The second system relies on the creation and maintenance by the user of systems designed to destroy data they want to keep. Unless Trusted Computing becomes a reality, that's not likely to happen — and even then, what could you do about physical media like DVDs?</p>
<p>Besides, there's a downside to this proposal: driving data archiving underground (so to speak) would lead to great losses in utility. Suppose that a message board's content is set to auto-expire after a few years in order to protect its participants from getting into trouble over their semi-private conversations. Google and other prominent digital archivists would no doubt comply with the regulation, depriving users of whatever legitimate benefit could be had from searching its content. But there's simply no way to stop, say, a group administrator from burning the archives to disc and then releasing embarrassing posts when another forum denizen runs for office. If data is valued, it will be retained.</p>
<p>I think the proposed system would work decently for preventing employers from going through photos of employees' drunken college exploits, or stopping health insurers from checking clients' web output for hints of preexisting conditions. But it would do very little to affect data retention by individuals — technologically-enforced auto-deletion won't work and encryption makes enforcement nearly impossible. And it's difficult to imagine how a universal technological solution would be any more effective at constraining data retention than simple legislation targeting specific industries that says, &quot;Hey! Throw that data away after X months!&quot;</p>
<p>As a technologist I'm extremely familiar with the temptation to accomplish everything with a well-designed system. But it's very difficult to constrain digital actions with digital technology. Fear of punishment is the only real way to change this behavior — and that can be instilled without rewriting every piece of software in existence.</p>

<li>I need to wriggle out of my T-Mobile contract. Well, one of them: I long ago escaped the one associated with my Sidekick, but I bought a separate number for DCist's LastCall service. LastCall's currently shut down due to some technical problems, and if I resurrect it I'd want to use a different SMS gateway. But I've still got over a year left on the contract.
Of course, there's a $200 early termination fee associated with quitting now. Bad. But T-Mobile has announced an SMS rate increase, which constitutes a contract change, which lets customers quit for free! Good! But I have unlimited SMS, so I don't qualify. Back to bad. Now I have to keep calling their CSRs until I get one that's especially sweet and/or confused.
I suppose I should feel guilty about my planned deceit, but I didn't get a handset when I signed up, and the ETF is largely in place to ensure that people don't get subsidized phones and then quit the service before the money's earned back. So my conscience is clear — it's just the sweet-talking that I'm dreading. Sage advice on this point would be appreciated.</li>
<li>I'm with Julian on <a class="reference external" href="http://juliansanchez.com/notes/archives/2007/05/was_this_article_written_by_a.php">this</a>: two dollars per cocktail seems very high. I am, I know, out of the mainstream when it comes to bar tipping: I've never really understood why bartenders are the best-compensated wait staff in a bar or restaurant when their jobs also seem to be the easiest and most fun. Besides, applying the same percentage (or higher) tip as when dining makes no sense: for drinks, the amount of effort the server has to invest in serving you is much smaller relative to the value of the total transaction (and therefore the tip) — the customer has to line up and wait to be served, there's generally no follow-up attention paid by the bartender, and less knowledge of the menu is required.
I suppose I feel this way because I prefer to drink cheap beer in dive bars. At Southwark a dollar tip per drink seems low — the gentleman on the other side of the bar prepared the beverage with such diligence, made such friendly, intelligent conversation and generally took such good care of me that it'd be incredibly crass not to tip generously in gratitude. But being expected to cough up a dollar per popped-top on $4 cans of Schlitz at DC9? I donno, man. Seems kinda dumb.</li>

                    <p>Wow. Friday night was incredibly impressive. <a class="reference external" href="http://www.badmintonstamps.com/">Josh</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.movering.com">Emily</a> and Lee decided to throw a party at a bowling alley in the basement of a church community center. They acquired large amounts of beer, pretzels and DJs, were written up on some Philly blogs, and had a ton of people show up to bowl, drink and have a great time. There's a less-biased writeup <a class="reference external" href="http://ohmurderinc.blogspot.com/2007/05/ok-here-i-go.html">here</a> (some photos, too).</p>
<p>I don't know if it's just a lingering effect of my Big Lebowski ascii art project, but it seems that I really enjoy taking photos of silhouetted figures bowling. So, uh, sorry about that. I think <a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/498341048/in/set-72157600214964628/">this photo</a> makes up for it, though.</p>

                    <p><a class="reference external" href="http://sunlitwater.wordpress.com/2007/05/14/i-can-sometimes-answer-questions/">Teo</a> has put up an interesting post discussing the use of a/an and how it evolved along with pronunciation (complete with bonus UVA tie-in!). Misuse of a/an is a pet peeve of mine — when I come across &quot;an university&quot; or a similar formulation I immediately know that what I'm reading is going to become terrible, if it isn't already. It's a great tip-off that the author hasn't made a connection between writing and speaking, and that spells trouble — a stream of &quot;whilst&quot;s is rarely far behind.</p>
<p>On the other end of the spectrum, of course, is <a class="reference external" href="http://www.matthewyglesias.com">Yglesias</a>'s neverending cavalcade of homophones — a case where speaking and writing are so tightly connected that all kinds of amusing minor typos result (see also: my constant overuse of colons, semicolons, emdashes and commas). I suppose you can err too far in either direction, but Matt's is by far the more readable option.</p>
<p>Of course, none of this explains the dismayingly frequent &quot;an historic&quot; formulation. I can't account for that one at all, except to say that I think our species is probably doomed.</p>

                    <p>Some guy had been wandering through my neighborhood for the last 20 minutes or so yelling what I assume is the name of his dog. It's sad, and I wish him luck. But seriously: &quot;Anton&quot;? I can't say I blame it.</p>
<p>In other news, I'm kind of exhausted. This weekend has involved 450 miles of travel (spread over four legs) and a grand total of seven scheduled events. All but one of those involved drinking, so I suppose I shouldn't really complain. Yet I'm clearly doing it anyway — sorry about that.</p>
<p>But right now I have an hour to myself, a sunny couch to lie on, and the presumably-excellent <em>Chronicles of Riddick</em> on TV. Time to upload some photos and begin the process of forgetting to do my timesheet. Ahh, Sunday.</p>
