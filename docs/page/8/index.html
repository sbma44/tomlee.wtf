                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>Well, I think that about does it for my Man Booker season. The winner is set to be announced on October 16th, and while I might be able to get one more short list entry read before then, my heart's not in it. There are a few reasons for this. Perhaps most importantly, my guesses about what would make it through from the long list have been much less lucky than <a class="reference external" href="/2011/10/04/the-man-booker-prize-novels/">the ones I made last year</a>, which means I'd have to read a lot more to cover the short list, and I'm feeling burned out on this kind of book. Plus a lot of what I've read from the short list has been surprisingly sucky.</p>
<p>And the remaining unread short list books just don't appeal to me very much. I read and liked <em>Wolf Hall,</em>&nbsp;and while a sequel to that book would surely involve plenty of Anne Boleyn badassery, I feel like I got the idea the first go-round with Mantel. I think I'd rather spend that time on the new season of <em>Downton Abbey</em>. Will Self's prose drives me completely bonkers, so <em>Umbrella</em>&nbsp;is a no-go (experimental work like that is sufficiently hard for me to follow that the effect becomes impressionistic, which is fine in some media but not when you enjoy reading for plot). And that leaves me with <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Swimming-Home-A-Novel-ebook/dp/B00992OLN2/ref=tmm_kin_title_0?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1349730794&amp;sr=8-1">Swimming Home</a>, which looks fine, but doesn't seem all *that* compelling (another book about depression! great).</p>
<p>Besides, it's October. I usually like to spend this month reading ghost stories. As it stands, I have a number of pending genre obligations: <em>Cloud Atlas</em>&nbsp;for sci-fi book club A, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Twelve-Book-Passage-Trilogy-ebook/dp/B007GBTBMY/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1349749331&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+twelve">the sequel to The Passage</a>&nbsp;for seasonal spookiness, and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Fractal-Prince-ebook/dp/B007NJPRRM/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1349749375&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=fractal+prince">the sequel to The Quantum Thief</a> for general mind-bending awesomeness.</p>
<p>But enough excuses. I did make it through a bunch of Man Booker nominated novels, and I enjoyed several of them. I've also found that I enjoy writing about books -- it's nice to know that you'll have that exercise waiting for you as you read. It seems to focus my thinking and makes me more attentive to what's going on. So, <a class="reference external" href="/2011/10/04/the-man-booker-prize-novels/">like last year</a>, here are some impressions of the books that I did manage to get to. I'll list them in the order in which I tackled them, and link each title to the longer review I wrote on Goodreads (something I've gotten into the habit of doing).</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/381251826">Skios</a> - Very light, very fun. A farce about mistaken identity set in a Davos/TED/Aspen Ides-y kind of context where rich people are seeking new insights and doing various other foolish things. There seems to be a sense that this nomination was to recognize Michael Frayn's body of work rather than the specific novel, which makes sense. This is one of the few books on the list that I think I'm likely to recommend to others (and have already, with success, in fact). But that's mostly because it's light enough that I can be sure I won't be traumatizing the reader.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/381251965">Narcopolis</a> - A book about addiction set in the dying Bombay opium subculture in the late seventies. Very, very good. My favorite of the short list entries, and the short list entry that I hope wins it all.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/381252044">The Teleportation Accident</a> - Probably my favorite book from the whole long list. A bit of a mess, and hard to describe. But striking, and with a really entertainingly bleak sense of humor. The hero is a shallow, foolish narcissist -- but he's still our hero, he's not there to antagonize you. I really liked it.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/405333188">The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry</a> - A tear-jerker, and what I understand to be a very conventionally Booker Prize-y book, but pretty darn good. I enjoyed it quite a bit.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/421045875">Communion Town</a> - The most bizarre inclusion on the list. A collection of short stories from a young writer, and one that betrays what struck me as a characteristically immature male sense of drama. Which is fine -- I write this as a guy who spent most of his free time this weekend building a supervillain halloween costume -- but it's unusual for a Booker entrant. Mostly the stories didn't work for me, but one or two were pretty good. There's an individual breakdown at the link, if you're intrigued and want a suggestion about where to start.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/427120739">Garden of Evening Mists</a> - Can a work be orientalist if it's written by an Asian? I say yes: in this case, it's a book written by a Malaysian that clumsily fetishizes various aspects of Japanese culture. I thought it was jumbled, cliched garbage, but judging by the Goodreads reviews I seem to be in the minority. Still, I really thought this was abysmally bad. Other reasonable people have read it and come to much milder conclusions (though the consensus seems to be that it's at least a bit boring).</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/412163757">The Lighthouse</a> - Not bad, but not destined to be a favorite. The protagonist has been permanently damaged by his mother's abandonment, but his resulting weirdness and childishness seemed a bit unbelievable to me. Not that he shouldn't be weird and childish! Just not in this way. Nicely written, though.</li>
</ul>
<p>And I think that's it! Now for some time-travel, vampires and post-singularity surrealism.</p>

<p>You should all run out of your houses, right now, and get on road bikes. Take them to the country. Trust me, it will be great.</p>
<p>Charles arranged for me and some other friends to do exactly that last weekend, and I think I'm hooked. Most of you already understand that I approach city biking with the kind of inflexible zeal most often associated with religious pilgrims or genocidal tyrants. But this kind of biking -- <em>cycling</em>, really, as people like the one I am becoming find themselves insisting on calling it -- it's something else entirely.</p>
<p>Charles has an in with a bike shop guy that allowed us to rent Madone 5.2's. These are very fancy bikes, built of little more than ashes, glue and less metal than you have in your coin jar. As you can imagine, they are very, very fast. Getting onto one, I immediately understood the profound absurdity of &quot;intelligent design&quot; in a new way. Had we been intelligently designed, surely this is how our muscles and tendons would have been deployed: stretched onto a frame that can outrun a deer, and more than a few racehorses.</p>
<p>It's easy to develop a taste for this sense of power, to seek that Frankensteinian reconfiguration. And yes, you will find that you've become an abomination: the villagers will never do anything but recoil at the sight of your spandex and energy bars. But you won't care anymore, because you will be a very fast abomination.</p>
<p>On a weekend like last one -- wow. What better way to be outside? Each pedal stroke was a moon-leap across dozens of yards of bean plants fading to yellow; violet flowers climbing up dried cornstalks; cows wallowing beside me and hawks coasting on thermals above me. I love autumn, but I didn't think I'd ever be able to capture the (probably illusory) intensity of the childhood memories of hay mazes and cider and indian corn that define its mental timbre. Consuming that landscape at speed, though -- that just about does the trick.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>I've mostly observed this phenomenon through the lens of forward-looking nonprofits in my professional space (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jywarren/public-lab-diy-spectrometry-kit">Public Lab</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1368665357/a-one-year-student-reporting-lab-within-homicide-w">Homicide Watch</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/228865951/transit-app-for-ios-6-and-beyond">Open Plans</a>); the early wave of developing world microfinance efforts exemplified by <a class="reference external" href="http://kiva.org">Kiva</a>; and the many game-related Kickstarter efforts that <a class="reference external" href="http://penny-arcade.com">Penny Arcade</a> writes about.</p>
<p>The words &quot;finance&quot;, &quot;lending&quot; and &quot;investing&quot; tend to get applied to these platforms, but that's obviously wrong. For both legal and practical reasons, the returns are always modest: you're either overpaying for a service, or for some digital or promotional knick-knacks, or the returns can only be reinvested in the service.</p>
<p>Thanks to the cynically-named <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jumpstart_Our_Business_Startups_Act">JOBS Act</a>, many of the relevant legal restrictions are going to disappear. But is there any reason to believe that practical considerations will? People are overpaying because they want to. It's not just about making sure that a particular thing happens -- look at the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/doublefine/double-fine-adventure">DoubleFine Kickstarter</a>, which has now collected more than <em>eight times</em> the budget its creators say it requires (there are plenty of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jywarren/public-lab-diy-spectrometry-kit">other</a> <a class="reference external" href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/659943965/planetary-annihilation-a-next-generation-rts">examples</a>, too). It reminds me of all the talk at the DNC about Republican defense spending proposals that vastly exceed the Pentagon's own statements about their needs.</p>
<p>These expenditures are about spending money not just because we want what it will buy us, but because we wish to promote the values associated with this <em>kind</em> of use. It's a subsidy to a particular class of thing and, perhaps just as importantly, an act of self-expression on the part of the funder. This latter aspect is deeply entangled with our human appetite for narrative: crowdfunders appear to value the consumption experience of (for example) picking out the village where a new well will be drilled over the knowledge of funding a venture that issues quarterly reports on the total number of wells it drilled. You can see this clearly in the emphasis on video storytelling on Kickstarter, or the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/09/business/global/09kiva.html">upset</a> that erupted when it became clear that Kiva aggregates funds since (gasp) money is fungible. If we cannot cast the act of funding into a meaningful narrative, it becomes much less satisfying.</p>
<p>For the types of projects that are most emblematic of this movement, it seems unlikely that the possibility of positive returns will attract many marginal investors. Rather, returns will attract a different <em>kind</em> of investor -- and probably a different kind of project. After all, the kinds of projects that currently succeed at attracting funding will have no reason to put equity on the menu when a well-produced video presentation can suffice. Sure, the possibility of actual returns can presumably matter for investors for whom altruism isn't the sole motivator. But there are <a class="reference external" href="http://advisorshares.com/fund/give">existing vehicles</a> for that kind of investing that come with a proper layer of regulation and diligence. I worry that we'll soon see projects that promise to satisfy our values, but which offer promised returns as a substitute for an established track record (I expect many of these to come out of Silicon Valley).</p>
<p>There's a huge disconnect between people who support the JOBS act because they are inspired by Kickstarter and those who are worried about hedge funds bilking seniors. I've got friends with strongly-held opinions on both sides of this; I have to admit that I don't understand the dynamics well enough to know where I come down. I will say that slowly expanding the SEC compliance burden is the <em>only</em> realistic mechanism I see for leveling the transparency playing field between corporations and consumers -- from that perspective, JOBS is tremendously disappointing.</p>
<p>But I suppose I'm generally heartened by Kickstarterism. It's obviously not a rational way to allocate resources. To a large extent, it's counting on investors to optimistically fill in the blanks about games and causes and projects, and many of the results will inevitably disappoint. You know how much less excited you feel flipping through movies in iTunes versus when you saw their trailers in the theater? It's like that. There is money to be made by charging your entry fee on the early side of that declining enthusiasm function.</p>
<p>Still, overpaying talented people and trusting them to make something great is a model that has, at times, produced some pretty wonderful things. At some point we mostly gave that up: efficiencies were sought, and the patronage model was abandoned in favor of a coordinating layer of fund managers and NGO executives and the like. As with any occupation whose practitioners take their duties seriously, expertise and rationality-esteeming professional norms tended to accumulate at that layer, and consequently funds were aggregated and disbursed on a (supposedly) dispassionate basis.</p>
<p>But now, thanks to the internet, we can cut out those irritatingly Spock-like middle-men. In a world of scarce resources, it's hard to wholeheartedly defend this return to romanticism. But those middle-men were only human themselves, after all (honestly, who were they kidding?). There are worse ideas than octupling DoubleFine's budget and then waiting to see what happens -- as long as we're not conning seniors into spending their IRAs to do so.</p>

                    <p><a class="reference external" href="http://crawfordkate.tumblr.com/post/29843732871/this-piece-at-the-billfold-is-terrible-an">This post from Kate</a> reminds me: I realized over the weekend that <a class="reference external" href="/2012/06/25/analytic-price-discrimination-is-becoming-a-real-pain-in-the-ass/">I was totally wrong about the evilness of automated price discrimination</a>.</p>
<p>I'd heard the arguments, but for some reason they hadn't sunk in. Pricing goods based on the buyer's means isn't too dissimilar to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.autoblog.com/2010/08/13/swedish-man-may-pay-largest-speeding-fine-ever/">the Swiss policy of ticketing drivers for amounts that go up with their incomes</a>. In most markets, it seems likely that this will amount to a cross-subsidization from rich purchasers to poor -- a progressive transfer. In the past I might have complained about this because the sorting mechanism used to distinguish between the rich and poor was basically to make the poor jump through a ton of hoops: weird store hours, clipping coupons, and otherwise imposing what amounted to a tax on their time (which they were willing to pay because their time was worth less than that of the wealthy). This seemed pointlessly wasteful and inhumane. I think that's the part that really bugged me.</p>
<p>But of course the stores don't have any particular desire to make you clip coupons. They just want to be able to effectively price discriminate. I realized that the privacy-dissolving information technology that makes that possible should be viewed primarily as a benefit to the less wealthy: the beneficial price discrimination scheme can continue, but with fewer associated costs to filter out rich people who aspire to freeloading. If those least able to pay can be given a price break without any gross affronts to human dignity, I'm all for it.</p>
<p>Of course, there's still plenty of room for the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/05/17/AR2009051702053.html">unscrupulous to take advantage of the less fortunate</a>, and there remains a tendency to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.wired.com/business/2012/04/ff_klout/">want to give rich people free stuff to promote overall demand</a>. So don't consider this a blanket endorsement of businesses hunting customers based on inferred wealth.</p>
<p>But the broader loyalty-card behemoth now seems less objectionable to me. I don't expect to retain much privacy in the face of technology; and to the extent we try to impose restrictions, enforcement against firms seems like the way to go. Let's pass some relevant legislation, beef up the FTC's budget and call it a day.</p>

                    <p>Last night Walt escaped a plastic zip-tie handcuff by using electricity from a household socket to create an electrical arc that melted the plastic. Not to belabor this, but when you short out a household electrical socket, this is what it looks like:</p>
<p>There are sparks of hot metal that burst everywhere, and it only lasts for an instant because the circuit's breaker or fuse pops. It's also probably going to complicate things to be connected to a very well-grounded metal object like a radiator -- to say nothing of stripping the live wire <em>with your mouth, which is wet and much more conductive than skin</em>, producing a circuit that flows <em>directly through your heart</em> as it heads toward your earthed left arm.</p>
<p>In general, that's how household voltages can kill you: by overcoming the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.darwinawards.com/darwin/darwin1999-50.html">actually-pretty-high resistance of your skin and disrupting your cardiac function</a>. It takes a lot of juice before electricity starts killing you through other means (basically: by cooking you).</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you grant the implausibly-persistent arc welder effect (perhaps Vamonos Pest has a dangerously configured but simultaneously robust electrical system), the grounded radiator would presumably have allowed Walt to apply it against the part of the plastic ziptie that anchored him to the radiator, rather than producing an unnecessary (but dramatic) act of self-mortification.</p>
<p>So yeah: it's implausible that he would've survived the wire-stripping without serious injury. And even making some allowances for an unusual electrical system, Walt could've done something less painful.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> in comments it's been pointed out that Walt turned off the power while stripping the wires. I don't remember that at all, but that's probably just my own lousy memory. The stuff about the electrical arc still stands, though.</p>

                    <p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/7809880534/"><img alt="Go time" class="right" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8448/7809880534_e9953fb8e6_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 240px;" /></a>I went skydiving with coworkers yesterday. This is the third year that <a class="reference external" href="http://konklone.com/">Eric</a> has arranged such an outing (though a last-minute injury kept him from going this year), and the first time that I've joined the proceedings. It was fun! The staff at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.skydiveorange.com/">Skydive Orange</a> were friendly and professional, and the whole process went very smoothly. And, though I <a class="reference external" href="http://instagram.com/p/OeM0n0PECT/">sort of joked about it</a>, the atmosphere really <em>did</em> remind me of <em>Drop Zone</em>, the great(?) Wesley Snipes <em>Point Break</em> knockoff.</p>
<p>(OT: having your male lead punch his love interest = really charming screenwriting, guys!)</p>
<p>I say this not because I saw Gary Busey kill anyone by forcing their parachute into high-voltage power lines (though obviously I didn't watch <em>every</em> jump), but because of the atmosphere. It was a big event weekend at Skydive Orange, apparently, with an extra plane and team competitions and beer-filled campfires in the evenings. Everyone seemed implausibly attractive, friendly, bohemian, and really, really happy. Skydiver parties must be pretty fun.</p>
<p>But of course as newbies (and ones who weren't camping out), that scene wasn't really available to us. Perhaps later jumps become about freedom and self-expression. For first-timers like myself, the experience is about introspection.</p>
<p>A few weeks back I found myself boozily explaining why I wanted to jump out of a plane. It was a statement about human progress, I said: a testament to our mastery over materials, physics and our own instincts. How many other species would ever pursue a recreational activity like this? How many subsequent generations, for that matter, will be able to waste the energies necessary to haul themselves up and down the atmosphere for a thrill? I was lucky to be born during an age when this strange, beautiful ritual was possible, and that struck me as a privilege I should embrace.</p>
<p>I still believe all of that, but the actual experience didn't tell me much about the fate of our species; it told me about myself. Specifically, about the kinds of fear that work on me. And I don't mean to flatter myself with the following: I don't think I'm a particularly brave person (quite the opposite, in fact). But this experience didn't trouble me. There was a sense of unreality about it. Nerves, sure. Necessary compartmentalization, certainly. And at the lip of the door there was that cliched moment of vertiginous terror as I looked down at the ground below and the miles of air between us.</p>
<p>But then I looked back up -- a field of view that was more &quot;window seat&quot; than &quot;imminent death&quot; -- and worried about arching my back, and whether I was causing any inconvenience to my instructor (an enormous Italian guy, now strapped to my back, who had complained at length about his car's failing catalytic converter as the plane ascended). And then I was tumbling; straightening; figuring out how to breathe; trying not to glance at my altimeter too much; and noticing the sluggishness of my arm as Mario guided it to the ripcord. Violence, satisfaction that the instant of greatest stress on the equipment had passed safely, and then a few still moments as Mario pointed out our shadow and gave a brief lecture on steering a parafoil. We slid to earth more smoothly than some slip-n-slide trips I've taken, and then it was over. Supposedly this took about six minutes; it felt like 90 seconds at most.</p>
<p>I had been told what to do, and I'd done it robotically, and it was fine. As I said, this wasn't physical bravery. I think such a thing exists, and is necessary for someone to become a great athlete or dancer or even just to photograph well. This was more about embracing blankness, ignoring anxiety by focusing on the task at hand. It reminded me of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.zunta.org/blog/archives/2006/05/14/ive_got_laser_e/">my LASIK surgery</a> more than anything else.</p>
<p>What was interesting was the fear that persisted outside the blankness: the worry over disappointing my instructor, or insulting him through second-guessing, or committing a dangerous faux pas by standing in the wrong place as people packed their chutes in the hangar. I think I understand better how a soldier can leap over the lip of a trench and into machinegun fire: it's because back in the trench there's a sergeant yelling at him, who would be <em>extremely disappointed</em> to see any hesitation. It would just be very awkward.</p>
<p>I'm sure it's different for everyone, but I think I know a little more about myself for having jumped. I'd recommend it to anyone, and encourage those who feel nervous to push through their fears. It's really not that bad. Leaning out of an airplane is infinitely easier than leaning in for a first kiss.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>I haven't quite figured out what to make of App.net. On the one hand, <a class="reference external" href="http://prospect.org/article/cost-hashtag-revolution">I've been worried about the corporate nature of Twitter for a while</a> -- the service is an important utility, and <a class="reference external" href="/2011/03/13/buy-now-pay-later/">I dread the rents that are going to be slowly, irritatingly and indirectly extracted from all of us as the company gets serious about making money</a>. App.net wants to be distributed, open and transparently funded; those are exactly the qualities I'd like to see in a Twitter replacement.</p>
<p>Yet I'm conflicted: I remember a wave of excitement around <a class="reference external" href="http://identi.ca">Identi.ca</a> and XMPP that was motivated by many of the same concerns. People were talking about federating with Twitter, building something more like SMTP or Usenet. Some early adopters cross-posted between the two services, but Identi.ca never really went anywhere. I haven't followed the fortunes of the platform closely, but I see <a class="reference external" href="http://techland.time.com/2012/08/13/app-net-made-its-goal-but-can-it-make-it/">troublingly</a> <a class="reference external" href="http://www.quora.com/App-net/How-is-app-net-going-to-be-different-from-Identi-ca">few</a> people asking how App.net will be substantively different, and even fewer plausible answers.</p>
<p>Predictably, the valley types most excited about App.net are talking about its odds in terms of its technology and business model. This is understandable: these are things that can be controlled. It is both self-flattering and empowering to pretend that these are the most important inputs to the equation that will determine a technology project's fate. Nobody likes talking about overcoming network effects or path dependence. Certainly no one wants to talk about dumb luck, novelty, stylishness or the role that celebrities like Ashton Kutcher played in making Twitter a hit. Not unless Marco Arment counts as a Kutcher-equivalent, anyway.</p>
<p>I wish these guys success, but it does seem like, having watched David challenge Goliath and lose, they've decided to make the next David a new shirt and send him back into the fray. Well, fingers crossed.</p>
<p>What's a bit more interesting is the idea that all of this is part of a new trend. You can find pieces proposing that Svbtle, Medium, App.net and their ilk all represent some kind of noveau-social-web minimalist/anticorporate movement (unsurprisingly, BuzzFeed has <a class="reference external" href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/jwherrman/welcome-to-the-new-internet-heres-what-it-looks">the one I found most easily via Google</a>).</p>
<p>This is stupid. Refactoring software is not a process that stops. As I've said before, <a class="reference external" href="/2008/06/13/the-internet-comes-in-waves/">I think online disillusionment and reinvention is a cyclical phenomenon, but that the periods of these cycles are increasingly out of sync</a>. By way of example, it seems suspicious that this allegedly-new ad-eschewing, content-esteeming minimalist web publishing movement seemingly doesn't include Tumblr or Instapaper. Those services are a couple of years old though, you see. Not much use for a trend story! And the novelty that these latest sites offer is strikingly threadbare -- nobody's even mustering a story as compelling as the celebration of Tumblr's incredible &quot;like&quot; (and not unlike!) button innovation. What they offer is not being the current thing, but seemingly not much else.</p>
<p>Still, it may be true that something is happening. <a class="reference external" href="/2010/05/12/schadenfacebook/">The relative popularity of social networks is a dynamic system</a>, and no equilibrium in this space should be considered permanent. Sometimes I picture us as so many early-adopting wildebeests, wallowing in our watering hole, grazing and snorting and occasionally forming ranks against threats (SOPA, lions). But perhaps there is a ripple of unease growing: a sense that the grass is thinning, the seasons are changing, and we need to move, move, move. Knots will break away, tentatively and unsuccessfully at first, but at some point it will be like a bottle that's uncorked, and we'll all flow across the plain to whatever the next thing is.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="/2009/07/02/after-twitter/">I've talked about this before, too</a>. It seems inevitable.</p>
<p>All of which brings me to <a class="reference external" href="http://dashes.com/anil/2012/08/you-cant-start-the-revolution-from-the-country-club.html">Anil Dash's post on this moment, or movement, or whatever you want to call it</a>. Even apart from Dash's unusually informed perspective, it's well worth a read, and the impulses it represents are noble. I'm a bit more cynical: <a class="reference external" href="/2010/02/11/thoughts-on-buzz/">I think attracting early-adopting elites is an important part of a network's success</a>, and that exclusivity rarely hurts one's chances. It's not a pleasingly democratic perspective, but I don't see any reason why these services should be exempt from the dynamics that clubs, restaurants, bands and political movements seem to be subject to. In this case, though, I'm not sure that the type of elites App.net is attracting -- <a class="reference external" href="http://daltoncaldwell.com/a-response-to-brennan-novak">people who care about things like PuSH and Webfinger</a> -- will presage broader adoption by non-technical cultures.</p>

                    <p>I've been meaning to write about the Breaking Bad season premiere all week; now with the next episode about to air, my window for having anyone care about the viability of last week's (spoiler alert!) magnet caper is rapidly closing. Nevertheless!</p>
<p>I was curious to know whether the episode's scheme -- which centers around the use of a salvage yard electromagnet to erase a laptop drive from outside a police station's walls -- was at all plausible. I imagine the Mythbusters will tackle this in highly entertaining fashion a year or so from now, but I wanted quicker answers. Conveniently enough, my friend M works at a related job, figuring out the chemistry that allows hard drive platters to be coated with various metals. So I wrote her and asked if she knew anything about whether this was plausible. Not specifically, she said. But! Her all-around science talent and experience provided some promising leads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm not sure how feasible this is. You would need to generate a strong enough field, get the field close enough, and also sustain the field long enough. I think that article mentioned that the power from the batteries were an issue and I think that is the biggest obstacle for a &quot;portable&quot; system. Not sure if the car batteries could sustain the juice long enough for the hard drive to get completely erased. Also distance is an issue. I think the field drops off exponentially away from the source, and other materials in the way (like the building wall) can dissipate the field depending on its dielectric properties. I don't know how well computer hard drives are shielded or what strength field you'd need to erase one, but it could be possible. Do you know what you would need for that in terms of strength and time? Seconds? Minutes?</p>
<p>We never erased a computer when I was in grad school, but we always kept metal and electronics outside the 5Gauss line when working near magnets. In the fringe field of a couple Gauss outside this, it was strong enough to erase subway tickets but not credit cards and definitely not a computer. To get a feel for lengthscales, a magnet of ~90,000G had dissipated to 5G by about 7-9ft away from the magnet. Metal would not get pulled from our hands toward the magnet unless we were within ~3 feet away.</p>
<p>I would be curious to find out how strong a field you need to lift a car though. I thought those junkyard magnets you have to be really close to the surface before it actually sticks?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This led me to some productive Googling -- well, productive in a certain sense -- that turned up a few more interesting details. The following has been written by a guy who never even took enough physics to get through Maxwell's equations. Still, I think it's not too hard to reach a plausible conclusion through some back-of-the-envelopery.</p>
<p>There are basically two considerations that M is pointing to: field strength and how easy it is to erase a given type of magnetic media.</p>
<p>On the field strength side, the news is not good for Walt and Jesse. Unlike most emissive sources (light bulbs; radioactive materials), <a class="reference external" href="http://www.physicsforums.com/showthread.php?t=450414">magnetic field strength declines with the cube of distance rather than the square</a>. Exactly why has something to do with the nonexistence of magnetic monopoles (outside of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.star-control.com/sc2/images/sc2_lander.png">Star Control 2</a> anyway) and seems to be one of those mind-bending situations where reality knuckles under to some particularly inescapable math. But the upshot is that magnetic fields get weaker very, very quickly as your distance from them increases -- faster than your experience with other radiative sources might make you think.</p>
<p>But how strong would the field be at its source, anyway? Here it's tough to say: <a class="reference external" href="http://genscoequip.com/products/Magnets">salvage magnets</a> seem to be specced by how much scrap iron they can lift, not the precise attributes of the fields they generate. But <a class="reference external" href="http://www.howstuffworks.com/question698.htm">MRI machines top out around 30,000 Gauss</a>. Is a salvage magnet more powerful? M subsequently warned me about reading too much into the fancy cryogenic cooling of an MRI's superconducting magnet versus the air-cooled conventional tech in the salvage magnet. They're different machines built for different things, with very different field shapes, she stressed. All this is true. Still, to me it seems at least unlikely that a salvage magnet could outpace an MRI machine. And judging by the example distances and field strengths in M's email, it would clearly need to.</p>
<p>Then there's the question of how much of a field it takes to erase a hard drive. I know a little bit about the considerations here, having looked into magstripe reader technology back when I was <a class="reference external" href="http://dcist.com/2005/12/14/dissecting_the_.php">fooling around with Metro's farecards</a>. The ease with which a magnetic medium can be altered is called its <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coercivity">coercivity</a>, and as M hints, there are high- and low-coercivity magstripe standards (for any that care, WMATA's farecards are low-coercivity, and I think not even digital; based on my abortive experiments with them, I believe that they use an acoustic encoding scheme, though I'm not positive).</p>
<p>Anyway! How hard is it to flip a bit on a hard drive platter? Things get tricky here -- coercivity is measured in Oersted rather than Gauss, and concerns the B component of a magnetic field rather than the H component (actually, neither are measured in those pre-SI units any more, but &quot;Gauss&quot; and &quot;Oersted&quot; sound a lot cooler than &quot;amp-meter&quot;). (H and B are <a class="reference external" href="http://www.irm.umn.edu/hg2m/hg2m_a/hg2m_a.html">linearly related</a> based on some constants specific to each material (the fields are functionally identical outside the domain of a given magnetic medium), so all the above business about field strength still applies). Quantifying the coercivity of a typical hard drive -- to say nothing of the magnetic shielding effect of the case and other junk around it -- is not something I've been able to do.</p>
<p>But we have some circumstantial evidence. For one thing, any dedicated nerd will tell you that a broken hard drive is a <em>great</em> source for extremely powerful neodymium magnets. These have nothing to do with flipping the bits on the disk (they're in place for the voice coil that positions the read/write head over the platter). But it does seem safe to say that having a very powerful magnet -- powerful enough that, given a pair of 'em, you'll have a hell of a time separating them with just your hands -- mere centimeters away from a hard drive platter is not enough to influence the data on the disk one bit, even as it whirls through the magnet's field at several thousand RPM. It therefore also seems pretty safe to say that you would need a noticeably strong magnetic field outside the device before data loss became an issue. In the show, of course, stuff flies all over the place, so in this respect, at least, Breaking Bad's verisimilitude isn't in question.</p>
<p>Finally, I am a little more optimistic about the viability of a battery power source than M is. This kind of project is a great way to wind up with a bunch of burning, half-melted plastic tubs of acid and lead (a horrifying clean-up problem, but I suppose Walt's seen worse), but an array of lead-acid batteries really <em>can</em> deliver an impressive amount of juice (turning over an engine takes quite a lot of it). Judging from <a class="reference external" href="http://genscoequip.com/products/Magnets">the afore-linked salvage magnet vendor's site</a> it looks like the show's creators settled on a realistic voltage; and indeed, Vince Gilligan <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/16/arts/television/breaking-bad-creating-magnetic-attraction.html">has said</a> that this was something the writers wasted a bunch of time worrying about.</p>
<p>All in all, though, I think Walter and Jesse probably should've stayed in the chemistry lab rather than wandering over to the physics department: for all of Mike's talk about the evidence room's impregnability, it sure looked like it was just a cinderblock wall. I suspect some explosives and incendiaries would've done a better job of killing the data on that hard drive than an electromagnet could. After all, there's a reason why geeks tend to talk about degaussing wands for sanitizing videotape, and thermite for securing old hard drives:</p>

                    <p>Just a quick thought (Sunlight's about to head out to a company outing at Nationals Park), but <a class="reference external" href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2012/07/19/business_schools_need_ethics.html">via Matt</a>, this Luigi Zingales quote hit a chord:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the economist&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/milton-friedman/">Milton Friedman</a>&nbsp;famously said the one and only responsibility of business is to increase its profits, he added “so long as it stays within the rules of the game, which is to say, engages in open and free competition without deception or fraud.” That’s a very big caveat, and one that is not stressed nearly enough in our business schools.</p>
<p><em>Lobbying to secure a competitive advantage from the government certainly does not represent “open and free competition.”</em> Similarly, preying on customers’ addictions or cognitive limitations constitutes deception, if not outright fraud. Not to mention using clients’ confidential information for personal gain, manipulating a major interest-rate benchmark such as Libor, or selling financial products you know to be flawed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Emphasis mine. This has been an idea I've been noodling on for a while: that stigmatizing corporations' presence in DC -- whether through direct purchases of lobbying or involvement in trade groups -- might be a productive path for activists. &nbsp;By this I mean to distinguish the stigmatization of lobbying, lobbyists and specific instances of corruption or malign influence (which everyone already hates) from the stigmatization of <em>being here at all</em>.</p>
<p>There've been recent, <a class="reference external" href="http://articles.latimes.com/2011/apr/08/business/la-fi-target-gay-20110409">successful actions</a> in opposition to corporate involvement in politics, but at the moment there's no realistic legislative or judicial path to constraining their influence. &nbsp;Maybe I'm kidding myself, but &quot;stop gaming the system&quot; seems like a viably nonpartisan message.</p>
<p>Also relevant to this is the work of my colleague <a class="reference external" href="http://sunlightfoundation.com/people/ldrutman/">Lee Drutman</a>, whose <a class="reference external" href="http://www.leedrutman.com/dissertation.html">dissertation</a> makes a convincing argument that the appropriate time to intervene in these matters is&nbsp;<em>before</em> an industry decides to head to Washington (Lee shows that once an industry sets up shop in DC they tend to stick around, even as the presence of their concerns on the policymaking calendar diminish) -- though presumably there'd need to be efforts to disarm existing lobbies (Google &amp; co. aren't going to be willing to sit on their hands while the long-established IP and telecom lobbies make trouble for them).</p>
<p>Anyway, something to consider.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>Like every other self-respecting fanboy, I was outraged by <a class="reference external" href="http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/cinema/2012/07/09/120709crci_cinema_lane">Anthony Lane's review of the new Spider-man movie</a>. But my reasons are idiosyncratic -- I don't care that he disdains geek culture (to each his own), and I don't care to defend my ilk against his charges of emotional immaturity (that's a fool's errand). No, I'm pissed because Lane tosses off an observation that I've been meaning to write up ever since it hit me during the drive to Ezra's bachelor party:</p>
<blockquote>
If you are a twenty-year-old male of unvarnished social aptitude, those movies will seem like much-loved classics that have eaten up half your lifetime. They beg to be interpreted anew, just as Shakespeare’s history plays should be freshly staged by every generation.</blockquote>
<p>I'm not in my twenties anymore (does that make this better or worse? probably worse). But he's right: I think the best analogy for understanding superhero reboots is new stagings of Shakespeare. Lane mentioned this dismissively, but he's more right than he realizes.</p>
<p>For a while I was confused on this point: why were these franchises being remade so quickly? Why did the plotlines (if not the spectacle) become unsatisfying as soon as the origin story was concluded? I left <em>X-Men: First Class</em>&nbsp;thinking the movie was a promising sign of these films evolving -- of the audience becoming conversant enough to dive into the non-origin plots that fascinated me through my childhood. <em>First Class</em> had a decent story, and more importantly it&nbsp;<em>felt</em>&nbsp;like a comic book story. Yet it wasn't an origin story -- well, not wholly. &nbsp;Given the now-consistent commercial success of tights-and-capes movies, maybe it wouldn't be too long before we got that Secret Wars or Infinity Gauntlet movie after all...</p>
<p>Now, though, I realize that this was stupid.&nbsp;In fact, the innovation of&nbsp;<em>X-Men: First Class</em>&nbsp;was its setting. Sure, they fudged things by picking some particularly venerable and/or long-lived mutants. But this was just an excuse to move the X-Men origin story into a &quot;Greatest Generation starts fighting the Cold War&quot; atmosphere. My favorite scene had Xavier and Magneto tweedily philosophizing in a Cambridge club.</p>
<p>This happens all the time with Shakespeare. Romeo and Juliet in 1950s Cuba. The Merchant of Venice with Christians in post-Saddam Baghdad. King Lear in space. Whatever. Or hell, just different stagings in roughly traditional time periods, with different actors, performances and directorial choices. These are perfectly fine reasons to revisit a work.</p>
<div class="docutils container">
Admittedly, the legal reasons that motivated Sony to make this latest Spider-man movie are not as good. And the movie that resulted is not that good, either -- I preferred it to Sam Raimi's films (his stuff is inescapably campy, which feels vaguely insulting), but it's inessential: it doesn't make many interesting choices other than giving Peter Parker a skateboard and Justin Bieber haircut (part of the coolification of Marvel's outcast protagonists -- a larger trend that coincides with the mainstreaming of geek culture, and one that I'm not happy about, <a class="reference external" href="/2012/04/26/sexism-is-a-problem-brogramming-is-not/">this sentiment</a> notwithstanding).</div>
<p>Of course, the reasons for new adaptations of Shakespeare are different from those motivating endless Hulk movies. If there's a spectrum of dramatic specificity, with <a class="reference external" href="http://moongadget.com/origins/myth.html">George Lucas deploying nebulous Jungian archetypes</a> at one end and, at the other, Prohibition-era gangsters talking about mercy droppething as the gentle rain, comic books sit somewhere in the middle. Exactly where is up for debate: how much of the experience's value lies in the canonical text (&quot;organic webshooters are an outrage!&quot;), and how much is in the archetypal gesture (&quot;yeah, Uncle Ben didn't say 'with great power...' but the theme was there&quot;)?</p>
<p>Although different adaptations <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare%27s_Romeo_%2B_Juliet">can</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0165929/">should</a> make different choices, my own sympathies tend to lie with the latter camp. The details of specific comic plotlines are satisfying to crazed obsessives like myself, but it's the broad themes -- myths set in the context of the modern world -- that make these franchises compelling. &nbsp;Even the comics themselves have realized that the characters, broadly understood, are the important thing. The <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retcon">retcon</a> has always been a necessary tool to scrape away peskily accreting continuity, letting creators once again show the smooth lines of their franchises' lovely archetypes. This process has recently managed to drop most of its shame and self-hatred, as the consolidation of universe-wide plot-planning at the publishers' executive level has allowed reboots to become well-branded <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Marvel">corporate</a> <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_52">events</a> rather than cringe-inducing disasters that individual writers cobble together from clones, Skrulls, secret robots, alternate dimensions and cosmic energy beings.</p>
<p>But although I think the correct dramatic approach is clear, it's hard to say how these efforts will actually evolve. There are commercial reasons for pushing audiences toward the specificity of costumes and theme songs and collectible Slurpee cups. I don't think Avi Arad earned a penny from <a class="reference external" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1706593/">Chronicle</a>, &nbsp;but it can certainly be understood as a stripped-down adaptation of any number of Marvel origin stories. I count that film's creative and commercial success as solid evidence for this being the most promising direction for such films: to continue to use superpowers as a way of telling stories about alienation, duty, agency and the limits of human identity. These are all excellent themes for the digital age, and mixing CGI with a spandex-heavy wardrobe department turns out to be a surprisingly good way to investigate them.</p>
<p>It's this thematic level &nbsp;where further explorations will pay off. I'll be personally happy to see deep-continuity stories that I remember from my childhood* translated to the screen. But the moviegoing public is never going to hit the back catalog for the education in Claremont and Morrison that they'd need to join me in giving a damn. Screenwriters tend to be geeks, and the movie industry tends to not understand how to adapt comics successfully, so I do expect these backstories to be mined out. But I don't think many of these adaptations will succeed. &nbsp;It's the myths that matter; their recitation through creative adaptation is what needs to become a tradition.</p>
<p>* I should probably note that my childhood comics budget was pretty meager, and so I absorbed a lot of the backstory through the efficient-but-bloodless medium of old issues of <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Official_Handbook_of_the_Marvel_Universe">Marvel Universe</a>. I'll admit that this might color my thinking a bit.</p>

                    <p>I've been working on an electronics project for *forever*, trying to get past some nasty linux wifi bugs and on to the exciting lasercutting/3D printing/web scraping stuff that actually attracted me to the idea (the hope is to make it a repeatable but customizable gift I can give). But to be honest, my willpower has been fading -- a body can only spend so much time in a given IRC channel, asking the same obscure and tricky questions, hoping someone will deign to answer them correctly.</p>
<p>So I took a break to make something a lot simpler. I don't want to give the whole backstory away -- it's going to be a gift, and the recipients might read this blog -- but the core functionality is as simple as turning a garden hose on and off via remote control. And hey, it worked on the first try!</p>
<p>(I probably won't actually follow through on the motion sensor part -- the audio is just me talking to Kriston, Kaylyn and my neighbor Paul, who was nice enough to lend me the use of his water spigot when I found out mine was cracked)</p>
<p>You can see most of the components below, if this third party Flickr note embedding thing is working. The wiring's all wrong in this photo, and it's missing a 12v regulator to power the remote system and the automotive relay that actually switches the 24v valve. But you can see the most exciting parts.</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/7482950154/"><img alt="it might not look like much, but this is one voltage regulator away from being a remote controlled sprinkler system" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8022/7482950154_5a2249547c.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: 500px;" /></a></p>
<p>The next steps are to arrange all this stuff in an appropriately-decorated Gladware container so that it can resist the elements and hopefully not light itself on fire: things get warm when the system's switched on, but I think that's got to be expected with a system this full of relays, and one that's shedding 12v through a voltage regulator (heatsinked and well within spec, though!). If anyone feels like replicating this project, here's the bill of materials and some approximate prices:</p>
<ul class="simple">

<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.allelectronics.com/make-a-store/item/SRLY-2/SOCKET-FOR-AUTOMOTIVE-RELAY/1.html">relay socket</a> (optional, $2)</li>

<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004RUHADO/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00">24v electronic sprinkler valve</a> ($17, plus $7 shipping from Amazon)</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.radioshack.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2062600">12v voltage regulator</a> ($2, though that's a ripoff)</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.radioshack.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2102856">heatsink for voltage regulator</a> ($2, and ...less optional. Don't forget the thermal grease!)</li>
</ul>
<p>It's a pretty good and easy project -- if anyone's interested in replicating it, leave a comment and I can sketch out a wiring diagram. If you buy the relay socket you wouldn't even need to solder anything: wire nuts would work just fine (I used a couple, in fact). Well, okay, you'll need to figure out how to attach the voltage regulator, and that's probably best done with a soldering iron. You might be able to get away with crimping stuff and then taping it up, though.</p>

                    <p>Kash has guest-blogger Elie Mystal talking about the relative toothlessness of the recently-released Declaration of Internet Freedom; <a class="reference external" href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2012/07/03/declaration-of-internet-freedom-contemplates-no-rights-or-freedoms-worth-declaring/">it's worth a read</a>. She's speaking about <a class="reference external" href="http://www.internetdeclaration.org/freedom">this document</a>, hosted at internetdeclaration.org and signed by a bunch of lefty net organizations like Free Press and CDT. Almost infinitely unhelpfully, a bunch of libertarian/right-leaning net organizations released a response document that was <em>also</em>&nbsp;called the Declaration of Internet Freedom -- you can find it at <a class="reference external" href="http://declarationofinternetfreedom.org/">declarationofinternetfreedom.org</a>.</p>
<p>As my friend Tim Lee has pointed out, both of these documents are so broad and vague as to be more or less perfectly compatible with one another. But of course their supporters <a class="reference external" href="http://techliberation.com/2012/07/02/the-problem-with-the-declaration-of-internet-freedom-the-digital-bill-of-rights/">will never acknowledge this</a>, because behind the pabulum is a desire to attract the anti-SOPA campaign's politically naive but newly-engaged internet advocates behind one or another camp's tribal ideological banner. The declarations are as broadly agreeable as an Expression Of Approval Of Apple Pie so as to appeal to as many potential supporters as possible. But you can reasonably expect the camp behind Declaration A to eventually email their new list members about net neutrality, and the folks behind Declaration B to do the same about government efforts to regulate telecoms.</p>
<p>These efforts should be understood as part of a larger race to grab leadership of what looks like a temptingly huge and ideologically-uncommitted political bloc. &nbsp;I think it's fair to view <a class="reference external" href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/rosiegray/the-pauls-new-crusade-internet-freedom">Rand and Ron Paul's new initiative</a> through this lens, and <a class="reference external" href="http://keepthewebopen.com/digital-bill-of-rights">Darrell Issa and Ron Wyden's Digital Bill of Rights</a>, and the <a class="reference external" href="http://internetdefenseleague.org/">Internet Defense League</a>.</p>
<p>I'm sure that no one undertaking these efforts is behaving wholly cynically. &nbsp;But it seems pretty obvious that a number of people think that they can get themselves crowned King of Reddit, then use the vast armies that come with that title to wrangle a bunch of small dollar campaign contributions or nonprofit membership dues or advocacy actions or invitations to speak at conferences. &nbsp;There's nothing particularly wrong with any of this -- though I <a class="reference external" href="/2012/04/16/cispa/">kind of suspect</a> that the people placing these bets are likely to find that they've badly misunderstood how the internet and political organizing actually work -- but it is at least a little slimy.</p>
<p>And it probably doesn't merit much policy attention. &nbsp;These documents are membership drives, not legislative programs. &nbsp;Though it is interesting to see the net bloc -- which (to the extent one can speak about it monolithically at all) seems to style itself as post-partisan -- begin to be <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/tjl/status/212210845739008000">inevitably absorbed into the world's existing ideological camps</a>.</p>

                    <p>Via <a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/timoreilly/status/217413877544132609">Tim O'Reilly's twitter feed</a> I see that <a class="reference external" href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304458604577488822667325882.html">Orbitz is experimenting with showing different results to Mac users than PC users</a>, based on the observation that Mac users tend to spend more money. The Orbitz folks claim that the price for a given hotel room is the same for everyone: they're just showing a different selection of options. Well, fine. Presumably other firms have just gone ahead and begun quoting a higher price to certain users based on their browser (one Australian firm recently decided to [STRIKEOUT:discourage IE7 use] grab some cheap PR by <a class="reference external" href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/13/kogan-hates-ie7-so-much-its-imposing-a-tax-on-all-shoppers-that-use-the-browser/">doing so as loudly as possible</a>). I've seen <a class="reference external" href="/2008/04/02/virgin-america-still-evil-but-now-defeatable/">suspicious pricing games</a> around online travel in the past.</p>
<p>My thoughtful economist friends will be quick to point out that price discrimination allows markets behave more efficiently, and in fact helps to keep prices down for those who are less able to pay. &nbsp;In a certain sense that all makes sense; and yes, my yuppie, Mac-owning ass probably <em>should</em>&nbsp;be squeezed for every dollar it's good for.</p>
<p>Still: it's irritating! And, when this process takes the more time-consuming form of, say, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/timothylee/2012/06/06/comcasts-obnoxious-price-discrimnation-strategy/">Tim's periodic haggling with Comcast</a>, it seems extremely inefficient. I can imagine solutions that free up Tim's time: perhaps <a class="reference external" href="http://www.fancyhands.com/">Fancy Hands</a> will begin offering a cheap &quot;Yell At Comcast&quot; subscription with a money-back guarantee. &nbsp;Similarly, I can simply start spoofing my browser's user agent when I shop online (probably not a bad idea in general -- you leak <a class="reference external" href="https://panopticlick.eff.org/">a surprisingly large amount of information</a> that way). But why should I have to throw money at a middleman for that service? Why should the technically useful information contained in a user agent string have to be deliberately destroyed?</p>
<p>It makes me wonder what Hayek would say about all of this. It's hard to imagine exactly what negative effects even an e-commerce behemoth like Amazon could cause were it to start monkeying with price signals in an effort to do a little social or behavioral engineering. It still strikes me as a generally bad idea, though -- and &nbsp;consistent with the idea of our markets (and every other societal system) growing ever more baroque, ever more filled with cruft, ever more ossified and inflexible. We filled up our tax code with this garbage; before long I suppose every retailer with a Google Analytics account will gin up their own microscopically small cross-subsidization scheme as well, as they aspire to make consumer behavior less about considered responses to pricing and more about aspects of the buyer's identity that aren't easily escaped.</p>
<p>This is perhaps a maximally gloomy interpretation of what amounts to a pretty minor incident in the evolution of personalized search. But what can I say, I'm feeling cranky.</p>

                    <p>Kriston wants me to believe that Sleigh Bells is good. To wit, he shares this video:</p>
<p>So! They've dropped the irritating <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipping_(audio)">audio clipping</a>, which <a class="reference external" href="/2010/05/14/sleigh-bells/">I found physically unpleasant</a>. But this is just as gimmicky. Have a look at the waveform:</p>
<p><img alt="sleigh bells waveform" class="center" src="/static/2012/05/24/sleigh_bells-20120524-233233.png" /></p>
<p>The Sleigh Bells audio has been compressed to hell and back. By way of comparison, here's the waveform captured from a Youtube of <em>Back In Black</em>, which we can hopefully agree is a not particularly sedate song (in order to be more than fair, I've tried to crop this to include both more time, and portions of the song that extend beyond the admittedly stuttery intro):</p>
<p><img alt="Back in Black" class="center" src="/static/2012/05/24/back_in_black-20120524-233416.png" /></p>
<p>Overcompression is standard operating procedure for recorded music these days. But it's also a cheap trick that makes things seem louder. That's fine for grabbing attention, but in the case of Sleigh Bells it's the second time they've made a play at the same gimmick -- and this is a far less daring move than the audacious/unpleasant clipping of the last LP.</p>
<p>I think the way to understand this is by way of analogy to food. There are certain reliable levers that chefs can lean on to stimulate our pathetic simian brains. More salt/more fat/more sweetness/more umami. Any of these will endow food with a greater valence. That's not a good or a bad thing, necessarily; it can be deployed artfully by skilled gastronomists, or it can be hammered home via a bag of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.fritolay.com/our-snacks/doritos-spicy-sweet-chili-chips.html">Sweet Chili Doritos</a> that's been crammed full of sodium, MSG and corn syrup solids.</p>
<p>Loudness is just the same. The louder it is, the more fervent it is; the more raucous the party, the more urgent the emotion, the more outrageous the rebellion. And Sleigh Bells is indisputably making their name by being the loudest bad around.</p>
<p>So I leave it to you: is Sleigh Bells a Ferran Adrià, or are they a Frito Lay? Tedious pop historians will adjudicate this, but based on the simplistic lyrics, repetitive hooks and increasingly well-worn playbook, I know where I'm placing my bet.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p><img alt="image1" class="alignright" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5446/7236838766_f7e30537f2_n.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 320px;" />I participated in Artomatic in 2009, making a hurried tech piece that ill-advisedly involved audience interaction, and which consequently spent most of the show broken. But the experience was a good one! For one thing, my project never caught fire. And for another, I learned some lessons about what makes a viable piece.</p>
<p>But mostly I just liked spending time at Artomatic. If you want to be a part of the show you have to volunteer for a few shifts -- I vividly remember sitting on a loading dock and reading about Dr. Hilarius as I spent eight hours directing fitful traffic to the parking garage. Being a part of the event provided me with a clear view of the operation and the people behind it. There are impressive strains of bohemianism, tenacity and mutual goodwill that make the whole huge structure of the thing possible. And I like that it's just for DC--there's no ambition, no pretension, just an insistence on pragmatism and (often cringe-inducingly) democratic ideals. I like it a lot.</p>
<p>The current installment of Artomatic opened on Friday, and though I'm not participating this time (no time; no ideas), I suspect I'll be making a number of trips to see what's on offer. Today was the first such foray. I only made it through two floors before closing time, but I probably wouldn't have made it through too many more anyway--the experience can be overwhelming.</p>
<p>I took a bunch of photos, but I have to admit I concentrated on the most absurd pieces (or those that reminded me of something else and which I wanted to share with friends). This isn't to say that there isn't anything good on offer (though it is safe to say that such pieces are in the minority). For instance, I enjoyed paintings by Bob Aldrich, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.juliabloom.net/juliabloom.net/Large_Sculptures.html">sculpture by Julia Bloom</a> and some <a class="reference external" href="http://districtdesignworks.com/home/index.html">CNC-fabricated furniture by Ryan McKibbin</a> (all of this was on on the seventh floor, if you're curious to seek it out).</p>
<p>But you don't want to see my crappy iphone photography of decent-to-good art, do you? What would be the point? Much more interesting are the pieces that seem strange or inexplicable. Am I a jerk for thinking so? Probably. I don't just mean to gape, though, or to belittle the artists. In part, I just like being reminded how different people are; how much their tastes and interests vary from my own; and how courageous so many of them are in exposing their idiosyncratic passions to the world. Say what you will about a crystal-covered painting of Oprah: it's a braver thing to display than the bloodless wood and reception bells I chose to exhibit.</p>
<p>Anyway, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/sets/72157629822458484/">here are some photos</a>. I'm sure I'll be adding to them soon.</p>

                    <p>Will Wilkinson is <a class="reference external" href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2012/04/technology-politics-and-hope">too kind to me</a>, but too cruel in general:</p>
<blockquote>
[The] hyperventilating false drama about never-delivered transformative change is by no means unique to the tech beat. Here on the politics blogs, we're only too happy to remind our readers that every coming election is the most important election in a generation, that the fate of our civilisation depends upon which of two barely discernible politicians' cronies get paid. If we can't generate a narrative with live-or-die stakes out of meaningless developments in public-opinion polls, then we've got nothing worthwhile to offer. Reflecting too often upon the ultimate triviality of almost everything we write about does no good for technology or politics writers, or for their readers. The illusion that the next thing will be truly meaningful has always meant more to us than the reality of the next thing. I agree with Mr Lee that there is something quite sad in the way Mr Madrigal, after having discovered that he has been reporting on nothing of significance, does not then go on to draw the well-warranted conclusion that he has wasted some of the best years of his youth foolishly yammering on about ephemera, but instead doubles down and declares &quot;we all better hope that the iPhone 5 has some crazy surprises in store for us later this year&quot;. But it's only sad because life is sad. Really, why not roll the rock back up the hill?</blockquote>
<p>I am rarely out-gloomed, but I think this is one such instance. So let me present a case for technology being meaningful. I think it's possible! Anyone who knows me can tell you that, contra my somewhat embittered bloggy pronouncements, I love technology. I mess around with Arduino on weekends; I obsessively amass, modchip and then fail to actually play game consoles; I spent my holiday building a programmable array of Christmas lights; and I can put my hand on a Digikey packing slip without leaving my bed (though this last credential is perhaps as much about messiness as it is about geekiness).</p>
<p>The point is that I believe in this stuff. Information technology, in particular, is incredibly powerful and democratically accessible, and I genuinely think it can improve our society. When you see me getting upset about the tech industry, it's because I feel that others have lost sight of this. They're making this inspiring thing I love into a silly business school game, or they're making ignorant promises -- on my behalf, it feels like! -- about things they don't understand and which won't ever come to pass. Loudmouths are distracting from good work done humbly. Fuck those guys; I hate 'em. I wish they would shut up and go away. But since they won't, we might as well get on with things.</p>
<p>If you're someone with technical skills, hopefully you you will prove to be better at ignoring those people than I have. Aside from that, I'd like to talk about the ways that I feel a career making technology can be meaningful. Because I really do believe it's possible; I would hate the people who know me, who work with me, to read this blog and conclude that I feel otherwise.</p>
<p>Not, mind you, that your job has to define you. There's nothing wrong with doing an honest day's work and coming home to enjoy your family, or partner, or dog. Pick up a hobby. Enjoy your vacations. In a few short decades you will only exist as the memories of your loved ones. A few more and you'll be nothing more than a couple of kilobytes in the Mormons' genealogical databases. I wish I had a better deal to offer, but by all accounts history is relentless, and it seems assured that rocking back and forth muttering/tweeting about &quot;innovation&quot; and &quot;disruption&quot; will be no charm against it. The important thing is to try not to waste the time you have on stupid bullshit.</p>
<p>I should warn you: this will be grandiose and sappy. To wit:</p>
<div class="section" id="improve-the-world">
<h2>Improve the World</h2>
<p>Yes, the hi-tech, still-quite-expensive things that you build will mostly be used by rich people. That's just a for-now thing, though. Smartphone adoption is already better than home broadband penetration. Speaking <em>very</em> conservatively, in two generations, everyone in America will be using this technology. In four, I'd bet on everyone in the world using it. And in the meantime, you can push on the decisionmakers. Correcting asymmetries of information can ameliorate asymmetries of power, despite <a class="reference external" href="http://gurstein.wordpress.com/2010/09/02/open-data-empowering-the-empowered-or-effective-data-use-for-everyone/">the occasional troublingly counterintuitive result</a>. Look at what <a class="reference external" href="http://publiclaboratory.org/home">Public Laboratory</a> is doing: democratizing technology to make it possible for ordinary people to monitor and -- hopefully -- legally defend the quality of their environment. I'm admittedly biased, but I find their work incredibly inspiring.</p>
<p>A lot of efficiency gains are made possible by better information -- <a class="reference external" href="http://www.greenbuttondata.org/">dynamic energy pricing systems</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://relayrides.com/">car</a>- and <a class="reference external" href="https://toronto.bixi.com/corporate/bixi-corpo">bike</a>-sharing fleets, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nest.com/">programmable thermostats</a>. Information technology has a real role to play in keeping the earth habitable.</p>
<p>But you don't have to know anything about IR filters or weather balloons or Arduino to make a difference. Designing a webform that serves the needs of some fraction of a social worker's clients, freeing resources for others: that's work that isn't flashy, but is truly important. By way of example, my friend Chris helped build a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.mixmarket.org/">clearinghouse of performance data for the microfinance sector</a>, and though I know the day-to-day development experience was nearly indistinguishable from any other CMS-project-hell, it still seems to me a very fine thing to have done. I'm sure that toiling on the EHR problem is even more mind-numbing, and yet it's unquestionably of huge potential importance. Writing a line of code can feel very distant from the act of directly alleviating human suffering, but that distance is and will continue to shrink.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="create-knowledge">
<h2>Create Knowledge</h2>
<p>The callowness and innumeracy of those promoting the Big Data brand almost defies belief, but (I should remind myself more frequently) it's important not to let this distort your perspective. Yes, there are dopes who don't understand that a properly selected sample of their (inevitably clickstream or social media) data could get them the same &quot;insights&quot; (always insights) as their massive Hadoop infrastructure. Plus it would let them use scientific-looking error bars, which I bet they would enjoy.</p>
<p>But there really are problems in need of solving which are bigger than human cognition. The gulf between the people who think their FitBits will extend their lifespan and the people working on actual computational biology problems is vast, but those willing to traverse it should be celebrated. There are archives to be digitized, regressions to be run, extraterrestrial radio signals to be processed. There are <a class="reference external" href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/superfastmatch/duzeewx_7-0/pzCqzFVtxxgJ">more disciplines than I can imagine</a> that could make use of our skills if only they were introduced to them.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="make-art">
<h2>Make Art</h2>
<p>All of this stuff is changing us, and we're going to need to spend some time figuring out how -- particularly as the energies, quantities and general magnitudes of the things we can manipulate grow ever more threateningly huge. Somehow we're going to have to give this old monkey brain the slip.</p>
<p>That would be the pragmatic case, but maybe it's foolish to try to mount one. What better thing could there be to spend your time on than making beauty? Besides, you'd be hard-pressed to read much of <a class="reference external" href="http://rhizome.org/">rhizome.org</a> or the (now-defunct) <a class="reference external" href="http://new-aesthetic.tumblr.com/">New Aesthetic Tumblr</a> or the increasingly philosophically-minded indie game scene and not come away convinced that a bunch of exciting, fast-moving (and yes, somewhat insufferable) conversations are reaching crescendo <em>right now</em>. It's getting to be the part of the party where you have to shout to be heard, and either everyone will start to dance or there'll be a fight or we'll get up on the roof. <em>Something</em> interesting is sure to happen -- it probably already is, in fact.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="try-at-the-very-least-not-to-hurt-anyone">
<h2>Try, At The Very Least, Not To Hurt Anyone</h2>
<p>There are a few subdisciplines that you should probably stay away from. &quot;Neuromarketing,&quot; Zynga-style games, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2012/04/ff_klout/">Klout scores</a> and other algorithmic approaches to eliminating human agency, dignity and/or equality strike me as basically evil, and though the trend they represent is probably unstoppable, I sure wouldn't want to be associated with it. Ditto becoming one of the quants designing the HFT engines of tomorrow, or one of the parasites that make their living off of SEO.</p>
<p>On the more benign/less high-skill end of the spectrum, coupon sites are starting to look less like a positive-sum marketing interaction and more like a system for skimming small businesses' revenue. This model has been deployed to arguably good effect in the past (newspapers! Gmail!), but this latter phase seems to merely be subsidizing my fellow yuppies' lifestyles in a sort of bizarrely regressive retail sales tax scheme. If you have the economic freedom to choose, I'm confident that you'll be able to find something more productive to do with your time and talents.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="if-you-absolutely-must-play-the-startup-game">
<h2>If You Absolutely Must Play The Startup Game</h2>
<p>Understand that you're unlikely to come up with a million dollar idea solely by sticking together free software like so many legos, hoping that lightning will strike and you'll wake up to a valuable population of users who are now pleasantly locked into your product by network effects and/or transition costs. Sure, it happens -- for now, Instagram still counts as an example rather than a punchline -- but a lotto ticket offers only slightly worse odds, and requires you to spend much less time fiddling with Keynote. It's simply too easy for other, smarter people to have the same idea and build it. Competitive markets are good for consumers and bad for entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>But if the startup dream compels you, I would suggest two things.</p>
<p>First, realize that ICT makes information cheaper. That's it, really. If you want to earn money with this technology, you should look for tractable problem areas where information is still expensive.</p>
<p>Second, connect your project to the logistical nightmare that is the real world. Ship physical goods, install a bikesharing fleet, go meet with the bureaucracy to get the data you need for your business intelligence site. These things are hard to do without leaving the house (or at least picking up the phone), and consequently fewer of them are being done. Another handy heuristic bucket: pursue ideas that require capital for things other than loft space, foosball tables and your bar tab. The low hanging fruit has been plucked, in other words. Reach higher. It'll certainly be more interesting, and you might even improve your odds.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="i-m-a-lucky-guy">
<h2>I'm a Lucky Guy</h2>
<p>I've already copped to not being a startup guy myself. I guess I should probably acknowledge that I'm not a particularly cheerful person, either. But while I have admittedly made some terrible decisions, my professional choices haven't been half bad, if I do say so myself. I'm extremely grateful to have the opportunity I do: one that affords me the chance to do work that I count as meaningful across a couple of the above dimensions.</p>
<p>I can't guarantee you'll have the good fortune I've had in finding a fulfilling way to spend your workdays, but I do wish you luck at not wasting your time.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2012/05/11/people_just_aren_t_that_into_the_internet.html">Yglesias is right to point out that not everyone is like us</a>: specifically, most people are not technologically-literate yuppies with motivations for avoiding cable TV subscription (e.g. self-betterment; vague anti-corporate resentment) that go beyond a simple cost/benefit calculation.</p>
<p>But! I still think he's too skeptical about the prospects for widespread cord-cutting. &nbsp;Matt doesn't link to any figures, but, contra the headline, <a class="reference external" href="http://articles.businessinsider.com/2012-03-05/tech/31123221_1_pay-tv-cable-industry-cord">this chart</a> sure looks like it's showing a downward trend to me, albeit one that's noisy and surely confounded by other effects like slowed household formation. And there's <a class="reference external" href="http://allthingsd.com/20120105/where-did-nine-million-cable-subscribers-go/">some reason to think</a> that cord-cutting is still a nascent idea but one that, <a class="reference external" href="http://techliberation.com/2010/05/13/cord-cutting-continues-25-of-homes-now-wireless-only/">like abandoning landlines</a>, will catch on once people see their peers doing it without ruining their lives.</p>
<p>I'll add that my own experience doing without cable TV has been a positive one. Netflix reliably has stuff I want to watch; iTunes has delivered season passes to the <a class="reference external" href="http://io9.com/5876238/first-scene-from-avatar-the-legend-of-korra-shows-our-heroine-kicking-butt/gallery/1">new Avatar series</a> and Deadliest Catch that, while not a steal, are reasonably priced and, aside from the slightly delayed delivery and regrettable absence of Cap'n Phil (<a class="reference external" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=seagull&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;prmd=imvns&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;ei=r1KtT-CKFsLL0QHxmbS3DA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=mode_link&amp;ct=mode&amp;cd=2&amp;ved=0CBUQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=751">RIP</a>), totally acceptable. Live sports remain the real problem, of course. A few years ago, when the leagues did their business with broadcast networks that made their money on ads, this would've been totally solvable. Recent years' shenanigans with cable networks and proprietary distribution channels make this situation seem a bit less hopeful, but I'm optimistic that growing consumer impatience will eventually spur lawmakers to get involved with these legally-granted monopolies and deliver the digital bread and circuses that the public rightly demands.</p>
<p>Finally, Matt makes a technical point:</p>
<blockquote>
The problem for people who do want to watch all their TV over the internet is that to provide enough video content to everyone for that to be the standard way of doing things, you'd need much more broadband capacity. And we could build much more broadband capacity, but people would have to want to buy it. And at the moment, it seems like people don't really want to. Of course they&nbsp;<em>would</em>&nbsp;want to if cable television stopped existing, but all the infrastructure is already there. Now maybe aggregate population preferences will change over time. There's certainly some evidence that they're shifting a bit. But hard as it is for web junkies to remember, lots of people seem perfectly happy checking Facebook on their phone.</blockquote>
<p>First: I do think preferences will change over time. Cohort replacement!</p>
<p>Second, there's more capacity than might be apparent. The basic problem Matt's gesturing toward is broadcast versus video-on-demand (VOD). Multiple viewers can watch a single, synchronous stream of programming -- the same amount of bandwidth is needed regardless of how many people tune in. For on-demand stuff, everyone typically needs their own stream of data, making scalability a problem.</p>
<p>But of course most cable providers now offer substantial VOD services without choking their systems. I <em>believe</em>&nbsp;that AT&amp;T's U-verse system actually delivers everything in a VOD-like manner, though it's a bit hard to suss out the details. Regardless, one can easily imagine various solutions to this that take advantage of consumer predictability and caching technology. &nbsp;When you tune into&nbsp;<em>The Voice</em>, you could be offered the option of watching immediately for a surcharge or waiting X minutes to hop on the next <em>every-X-minutes</em> scheduled broadcast stream. Or&nbsp;your DVR could download the week's ads every Sunday night, then stagger their distribution between pre-roll and mid-broadcast placement in order to line you up with the next broadcast stream. One can even imagine dynamic schemes where content is priced according to current network conditions and your subnet-neighbors' current viewing habits. That would probably be economically fascinating enough that even Matt would be in favor.</p>

                    <p>Matt <a class="reference external" href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2012/05/08/paul_boutique_sampling_and_the_law.html">makes a point</a> that more people in the free software space should learn to appreciate:</p>
<blockquote>
Another issue raised in comments is the idea that a &quot;fair use&quot; by definition can't be commercial. I was glad to see someone raise this point if only because I do wish we could re-inject more life into the commerce/non-commercial distinction for broad copyright purposes. But my goal would be to use the distinction to raise the scope of tolerated non-commercial copying, not to narrow the scope of allowable commerce. Commerce is a legitimate and important human undertaking, and the goal of copyright law should be to facilitate useful commerce. That includes preventing large-scale commercialized digital copying, but I think also means allowing commercialized sampling, quoting, and repurposing of existing material.</blockquote>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2012/05/02/defending-the-big-tent-open-data-inclusivity-and-activism/">I made a somewhat similar point recently when talking about open data</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
[...] I think it’s flatly wrong to consider private actors’ interest in public data to be uniformly problematic. We should be clear: we won’t tolerate those interests’ occasional attempts to lock public data into exclusive monopolies. I think our community has done a&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.globalintegrity.org/blog/bank-responds-to-google-maps-deal">pretty good job lately</a>&nbsp;of identifying such situations and stopping them, and of course people like&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://boingboing.net/2012/03/19/liberating-americas-secret.html">Carl Malamud</a>&nbsp;have been doing important work on this question since well before most of us ever heard of &quot;open data.&quot; But if commercial activity is enabled by data, that’s all to the good—the great thing about digital information is that scarcity doesn’t have to be a concern. Google Maps’ uses of Census TIGER data, for instance, is proprietary, motivated by profit, and unquestionably a huge boon to human welfare. And&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.census.gov/geo/www/tiger/">the source data remains free for anyone else to use</a>! Cutting off those kinds of uses with noncommercial licensing would be nothing more than a destructive act of pique.</blockquote>
<p>This really came into focus for me when I was in Berlin for a conference run by the good folks at the <a class="reference external" href="http://okfn.org/">Open Knowledge Foundation</a>. I admit that before I stopped to think about it, I never found noncommercial licenses that problematic, and would casually throw them on material I produced on the web. That way our vaguely-defined communal web society (so pure and untainted by the profit motive!) could use it, but &quot;they&quot; wouldn't benefit from my hard(?) work tagging photos on Flickr. Honestly, this was dumb. I was never going to put in the time to try to make money off of those photos. If someone else could do the work to make them useful to others, why begrudge them that opportunity?*</p>
<p>I wouldn't go as far as Matt about the goal of copyright law being to facilitate commerce (this formulation seems to ignore the kind of deadweight losses that Matt's writing about IP is usually about). &nbsp;But he's right about commerce being a &quot;legitimate and important human undertaking.&quot; &nbsp;Certainly the private sector is capable of excesses, but it's also an incredible tool for identifying and satisfying human needs. We shouldn't resent it out of some sort of ideological tribalism -- particularly when we're discussing digital goods, where things are rarely zero-sum and where (with apologies to Julian and Kash) the negative externalities (Mark Zuckerberg can infer your sexual preferences) are less severe than those found in the physical world (the chemical plant next door means your baby was born with fins).</p>
<p>* I should acknowledge that this is just a for-instance. As there's very occasionally a market demand for unflattering photos of some of my friends by ideological press outlets, I've elected to keep somewhat restrictive licensing on my meager photographic output. But in less problematic cases -- the code I put on GitHub, for instance -- I've moved to open, nonviral licensing.</p>
