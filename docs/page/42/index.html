<li><a class="reference external" href="http://torrentfreak.com/comcast-wrongfully-denies-interfering-with-bittorrent/">Comcast claims they aren't interfering with BitTorrent despite strong evidence to the contrary</a>. The problem apparently isn't affecting all Comcast users, and TorrentFreak says that some BT client authors are integrating workarounds into their programs. So if you're a Comcast customer perhaps you don't need to panic after all.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=13829386">Frank Deford on pro wrestling's high mortality rate</a>. It's nice to see a real sports journalist talk about wrestling and its occasionally tragic aspects without sneering. But Deford's stretching things when he tries to connect the deaths directly to steroid abuse in other sports. Yes, wrestlers' anabolically-enhanced bulk contributes to a lot of premature heart attacks. But that's just part of the story — there's also abuse of other substances among wrestlers, particularly opiates. The industry involves a lot of travel and an economic structure that encourages wrestlers to continue to work while injured. As a result a staggering number of wrestlers get addicted to painkillers at one point or another, and often other drugs as well. The lifestyle is basically that of a chemically supercharged carny. Steroid use certainly isn't healthy, but I don't think it completely explains why the wrestling industry produces so many dead men in hotel rooms.</li>

<p><strong>CLERK:</strong> <a class="reference external" href="http://tinyurl.com/3x57kj">Mo/rris House Bed &amp; Breakfast</a>, how can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>ME:</strong> Yeah, hi. My parents got me a gift certificate to your hotel for my birthday and I'd like to make a reservation to use it.</p>
<p><strong>CLERK:</strong> Certainly sir, I can help you with that.</p>
<p><strong>ME:</strong> The only thing is, the certificate says it expires on August 31st, and I'd actually like to make the reservation for September 1st, the day after. Will that be a problem?</p>
<p><strong>CLERK:</strong> Uhh... I'll have to check. Can I call you back?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Later...</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>CLERK:</strong> Hi, this is Mo/rris House. I talked to my supervisor and she said it'll be fine for you to use the certificate on September 1st.</p>
<p><strong>ME:</strong> Great!</p>
<p><strong>CLERK:</strong> Let me just check and... oh. Hmm. There's a problem. We only have one qualifying room left on that date.</p>
<p><strong>ME:</strong> Great, that'll be fine.</p>
<p><strong>CLERK:</strong> No, see, I can't give you that room. It's our last one.</p>
<p><strong>ME:</strong> I don't understand. The certificate has been paid for... It's not like you're giving me the room for free.</p>
<p><strong>CLERK:</strong> I'm trying to work with you sir, but if you look at the gift certificate it does say &quot;subject to availability&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>ME:</strong> Right, and you just told me that a room is available.</p>
<p><strong>CLERK:</strong> Listen, I'm trying to work with you, sir. We're trying to be flexible about the date.</p>
<p><em>We go through this several more times. The hotel's policy does not begin to make more sense.</em></p>
<p><strong>ME (exasperated):</strong> Okay. I understand the hotel already has the money for this gift certificate and doesn't want to honor it if it can possibly earn more money from someone else instead. Can I pay an up-charge or something and get the room?</p>
<p><strong>CLERK:</strong> Uh... I'll have to check. Can I put you on hold?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Without hanging up, the clerk calls me on a different line.</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>CLERK:</strong> I got good news for you, sir! I can give you the room if you pay an extra $20.</blockquote>
<p>So fine, I paid the $20. But really now: c'mon. My parents' thoughtful gift has already been paid for with perfectly good money. It's time for you to honor your end of the bargain. Stop being such jerks.</p>
<p>I'm Googleproofing this for the time being so that the Mo/rris House people don't do horrible things to our breakfast or play more reservation shenanigans. But this is pretty sleazy behavior. It's just one goddamn day. Is it really worth jerking your clients around for an extra $20?</p>

                    <p>I might have to reconsider the Ocean: <a class="reference external" href="http://mstem.wordpress.com/">Matt</a> tipped me off to the fact that some intrepid Helio users have <a class="reference external" href="http://www.heliocity.net/2007/opera-mini-for-everybody-custom-apps-yay/">figured out a way to load J2ME apps on the phone</a>. The first big success is Opera Mini, an excellent web browser that can now supplant the Ocean's neutered default browser.</p>
<p>The advance is related to a wrapper that's been written for the platform. Lots of phones can run Java Midlets, and consequently lots of Midlets are available. But Helios can't use them. They employ a less-common Java technology called WIPI. That's the crux of the breakthrough: someone's come up with a way to wrap Midlets as WIPI apps. There are kinks to be worked out (the QWERTY keyboard on the Ocean doesn't work within Opera, for example), but this is clearly a big deal.</p>

<p>Mail is terrible. In my experience it's uniformly either irrelevant or bad news. Mostly it's the former, of course: American Express seems to feel they need to check in with me about four times a week, and various bafflingly unfamiliar organizations keep trying to push credit cards on me (at right: The American Quarter Horse Association's offer, received just a few hours before I wrote this).</p>
<p>The important stuff — which is, of course, indistinguishable from the junk — is always, always bad news. Mostly it's bills. Sometimes it's a coded warning that in several months I'll almost forget to buy a wedding present for someone. The best case scenario is that I've merely slid a little further into emotional debt to a faithfully corresponding family member. Good news arrives electronically. Duties are printed on paper, like military orders.</p>
<p>I tried to at least dispense with the bills. Bank of America made it seem like I could plausibly receive and pay bills online. When they added a feature that allowed me to automatically respond to incoming bills — no attention or volition required! — I enthusiastically handed my checkbook over to a robot. I spent the last 8 months or so throwing away every communication that looked even a little bit like it was from a credit card company. Sometimes I'd tear them up (identity thieves lurk everywhere!) but it was more satisfying to shove their evil, glossy bulk straight into the trash can. It was a wonderful time in my life. I felt free.</p>
<p>Sadly, I'm now putting my shackles back on. Several-too-many completely unexpected and alarmingly large credit card bills have proven to me that automatic bill payment is too erratic to trust. I'm sure that some day it'll be possible not to have to worry about debts on a near-daily basis. But I'm now convinced that it'll only happen after Star Trek-style collectivism finally kicks in and does away with currency altogether.</p>

<p>Following in the footsteps set last week by carnival-attendance pioneer <a class="reference external" href="http://silbatron.com/?p=211">Michael Silberman</a>, this Saturday a small group of daring adventurers set out for the Montgomery County Fair. The results were well-documented.</p>

                    <p>Comcast has placed new anti-Bittorrent restrictions in place, limiting download speeds and, crucially, preventing those with completed downloads from &quot;seeding&quot; — continuing to contribute to the Bittorrent swarm. Eliminating seeders cripples a swarm; if enough ISPs did it, the efficiency of the protocol would plummet. Many swarms would no longer be viable.</p>
<p>Encryption doesn't seem to help. The protocol's creator, <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bram_Cohen">Bram Cohen</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://torrentfreak.com/interview-with-bram-cohen-the-inventor-of-bittorrent/">warned that BT encryption was a bad and pointless idea</a>, and is being proven right as ISPs like Rogers simply <a class="reference external" href="http://torrentfreak.com/rogers-fighting-bittorrent-by-throttling-all-encrypted-transfers/">throttle all encrypted traffic</a>. There's a <a class="reference external" href="http://torrentfreak.com/comcast-throttles-bittorrent-traffic-seeding-impossible/#comment-148293">workaround for the Comcast measures</a> if you've got a Linux firewall, but of course most folks don't.</p>
<p>Admittedly, this doesn't rank among the greatest injustices in human history. Most of the affected activity involves copyright infringement. But not all. And this issue will become increasingly relevant and legitimized as bandwidth-intensive data services proliferate — movies will be downloaded by your Tivo, game consoles will download ever-larger game demos and add-ons. People will start to notice that ISPs can capriciously degrade service when their accounting departments demand it. And people won't like it.</p>
<p>I think the solution is metered bandwidth. <a class="reference external" href="http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/08/18/1138224&amp;from=rss">The Slashdotters want it, too</a>. Right now the price jump from consumer service to business service is too large — who's going to pay double the price simply for a contract with terms that Comcast actually has to obey? We need more granular pricing, and metered bandwidth is the obvious way to provide it.</p>

Don't forget the accompanying Washington tradition: the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.donandmikewebsite.com/main.shtml">Don and Mike</a> Elvis Death Day Show.</p>
<p>I know it's shameful to be a shock jock apologist. But these are DC's homegrown shock jocks — I grew up listening to them, way back when they manned the morning show on a pre-Christian WAVA. I'll probably always have a soft spot for them, regardless of how vile and unfunny they can occasionally be. Besides, whatever your opinion of their daily show, there's really no better place to hear just what a weird dude Elvis Aaron Presley was on an annual basis. 3pm at the link above.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> The podcast of the show is now <a class="reference external" href="itms://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=114454618">available on iTunes</a>. It'll scroll into oblivion soon, so if you're interested in hearing about Elvis's weird sexual habits and astounding pharmaceutical intake, act now!</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>It's perpetually surprising to me that articles like <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/14/science/14tier.html?ei=5124&amp;en=22efff4469281187&amp;ex=1344744000&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink&amp;adxnnlx=1187101355-5HWiLxChv9ReqvISlLpTnQ">this one</a> can find their way into the Science section of what is by most accounts a Newspaper For Smart People. Even more astounding is that they got David Chalmers to contribute some quotes to it.</p>
<p>You should read the piece for yourself, but the gist of what John Tierney excitedly reports is that Dr. Nick Bostrom, Oxford philosophy professor, has decided that we may all be living in a computer simulation. He reasons that future civilizations will become advanced enough to run simulations of brains, and that they'll make widespread use of this technology for entertainment or to research their past. If they use it enough, the odds of a given mind from any point in history occurring outside of the system become quite low. If you consider the possibility of nested simulations the odds diminish even further.</p>
<p>The whole &quot;ancestor simulation&quot; premise sounds like it suffers from some confusion about the reversibility of deterministic processes. There's also a bit of an issue with thinking that a lack of information can be remedied with probabilistic hand-waving (<a class="reference external" href="http://crookedtimber.org/2007/07/17/against-the-copernicans/">this Crooked Timber post</a> rails against the technique nicely). Bostrom's ideas, or at least Tierney's writeup, seem to ignore the considerably better-developed and more interesting speculation about the possibility of an <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omega_point_%28Tipler%29">Omega Point</a>. And I have some anti-reductionist complaints that I doubt anyone reading this blog will be very receptive to.</p>
<p>But mostly this is bad because it's all so <em>banal</em>. Put a group of freshmen in a room with a copy of <em>Principles of Philosophy</em>, the first <em>Matrix</em> movie and a dime bag and you'll get pretty much the same thing (including the overly-cute World of Warcraft reference).</p>
<p>Amazingly, this is actually only the second-worst science article I've recently read. Check out <a class="reference external" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6945732.stm">the BBC's coverage of an amazing new &quot;paper battery&quot;</a> — a carbon-nanotube-based technology from Rensselaer that made Slashdot's frontpage yesterday. The writeup is bold enough to include a &quot;How a paper battery works&quot; graphic without actually demonstrating any evidence that the admittedly paper-based technology could be used as a battery. The article mentions voltage, but nothing about capacity. Neither does the original press release upon which it's based, which ought to be a red flag to anyone who took AP Physics and/or has wondered why we use batteries despite the existence of capacitors.</p>
<p>This looks like an awful lot like a novel capacitor and nothing more. I seriously doubt it can store a fraction as much charge as even the cheapest chemical cell on sale at the nearest drugstore. Carbon nanotube ultracapacitors may become a useful technology someday, but we're nowhere near replacing the lithium batteries in your mobile electronics with them. But you'd never know from the article that this technology's energy-storage applications will likely be limited to digital watches... maybe.</p>
<p>I can only think of two reasons why science coverage is so awful, neither of which is particularly original, but both of which I can't resist repeating. First, there's obviously the question of expertise — journalists need to be generalists. Even when they consult an informed party for a quote, they may not trust that source's judgment about what makes (or fails to make) the story newsworthy — they just see &quot;possible applications include curing cancer and humanity's lack of heat-vision&quot; on the press release and decide to run with it.</p>
<p>Second, and more evident in the Tierney article, I suspect, is the industry's willingness to let science fans like Gregg Easterbrook pursue their hobby on their employer's dime (and newsprint) after proving themselves in some other journalistic area. I can't blame these writers for trying this — I'd do the same thing if I were in their position, and probably embarrass myself just as often. But the expertise problem must frequently stop their editors from exerting enough influence on the result.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Tim Lee also thinks Tierney's article is <a class="reference external" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/techliberation/~3/144497653/042679.php">pretty lame</a>.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE 2:</strong> BoingBoing has <a class="reference external" href="http://www.boingboing.net/2007/08/15/hans_moravec_on_livi.html">posted</a> a letter in which the writer implies that Dr. Bostrom is ripping off a 90s sci-fi author who used a similar premise in one of his stories. That seems extremely unlikely to me, but I do think it's good further evidence of how obvious the idea is.</p>

<p>Apologies to everyone who's already heard this story. The weighty responsibilities of internet citizenship demand that I record it for future generations.</p>

<div class="line">One of the best things about almost being a <a class="reference external" href="http://dcist.com/authors.php?author=dcist_tom">fake journalist</a> is</div>
<div class="line">that it occasionally affords me invitations to fake press events.</div>
<div class="line">They're not all that fake, I guess — like all such events, they're</div>
<div class="line">trying to attract favorable coverage. But they're a little more shameless</div>
<div class="line">about it than they would be were they pitching writers with a sense of</div>
<div class="line">professional self-respect. This works out better for everyone involved.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Last Friday this translated into an invitation to Chevrolet's &quot;Re/v It</div>
<div class="line">Up&quot; event. They've been holding these things all over the</div>
<div class="line">country; DC was the last stop. Racing fans and their beleaguered mates</div>
<div class="line">travel from miles around to drive Chevy Cobalts (as seen at Hertz!)</div>
<div class="line">through a sea of orange traffic cones. Participants' scores are</div>
<div class="line">calculated relative to the time posted by a professional driver who runs</div>
<div class="line">the course several times a day. At the end the top scorers from each city are flown in and compete head-to-head for a new Corvette.</div>
</div>
<p>I'm not exactly sure why they invited me — I don't know or write about cars, but somehow I've ended up on Chevy's press list. It's either not a very big list or, more likely, one that few people respond to: the media turnout for the event totalled about 8 people — and that's including a few VIPs who were rolled into our group for its line-skipping abilities. The participant that came closest to representing an august general-interest publication was from <em>Washington Hispanic</em>.</p>
<p>I took the Metro out to Fedex field, which was a big mistake. The Morgan Boulevard Metro station, like all above-ground Metro stations, was located principally to justify the creation of a godawful tract housing development. It was only when workers were plugging in the turnstiles that someone finally looked up and noticed an enormous football stadium looming in the distance — one that tens of thousands of people would want to attend on a regular basis.</p>
<p>As a result it's kind of a hike to the stadium, and it was even further to get to the corner of the parking lot where Chevy had set up. The day was hot, and I was soaked in sweat by the time I got there. They gave me a badge, waved me through and immediately began distracting me with a stratospherically hot (and, one presumes, equally evil) PR rep. She gave me water, laughed at a couple of my dumb jokes and congratulated me on riding public transportation in a manner usually reserved for developmentally disabled adults.</p>
<p>Eventually an artificially genuine-seeming media liaison named <a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/1082554185/in/set-72157601367709626/">Dan</a> showed up and led us to the &quot;Rules &amp; Regulations&quot; tent, where a bored failed racecar driver explained to us what not to do. First on the list of proscribed activities: thinking that Chevy isn't awesome! Variations on this point consumed about two-thirds of his presentation. The only actual rules I remember hearing:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>No spinning tires at the start line — although a later instructor told us that we should probably spin them sort of a little, but not too much(!) because that'd make us go slower.</li>
<li>In what I presume is a nod to the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/02/AR2007060201293.html">Unifest unpleasantness</a>, we were forbidden from hitting any cones, and threatened with a two-second penalty <em>per cone</em> should we violate this rule. Except on the practice track, of course, where we could cream as many cones and/or street festival attendees as we'd like.</li>
</ol>
<p>Next were the instruction tents, where Dan the Media Guy introduced us to a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/1082560203/in/set-72157601367709626/">grizzled driver</a> who had &quot;done it all&quot;, which in this case means he's driven various cars on tracks both circular and straight. &quot;He lost the original Cannonball Run by twenty minutes! The original one, the real one!&quot; Dan repeated this factoid several times, perhaps after being disappointed by the lack of revery it initially inspired. I didn't and still don't really know what it meant, except perhaps that I was standing near someone who had once met Burt Reynolds.</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/1082560203/"><img alt="one of the instructors" class="center" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1276/1082560203_8adba40315.jpg" style="width: 375px; height: 500px;" /></a></p>
<p>Introductions dispensed with, we began receiving instruction. Over the next 45 minutes or so we learned a new and completely bewildering take on physics — one shaped by experience on the track, and one that I'm sure works fine as a set of heuristics, but also one that bears very little resemblance to everything I've ever been taught about how the physical world operates.</p>
<p>You've got your contact patches and apex points, of course, and the hilarious and heavily-stressed technique of &quot;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.tcsracing.org/oculardrivingtips.htm">ocular driving</a>&quot; — which, yes, means that while driving you should <em>use your eyes</em>. But these are just jargon laid atop a more fundamental philosophy. The racing experience is explained in terms of a sort of motorsport panpsychism. <em>Everything</em> is anthropomorphized, and your progress down the track is recast as a complicated negotiation between the animistic spirits of the asphalt, tires, engine and brakes. The driver's will seems to have very little to do with it (which, to be fair, is pretty accurate in my case).</p>
<p>I left the tent confused, but in the mood to drive recklessly. We headed to the practice course and did a few laps — it was a slightly deflated loop with tight turns and a slalom section. I didn't kill any cones or people. From there we headed to the competition course, where we donned hairnets and fantastically stupid-looking helmets (see above) and took two timed laps around the track, competing against one another.</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/1083532902/"><img alt="leaderboard detail" class="center" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1177/1083532902_5a03914f8f.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: 320px;" /></a></p>
<p>So alright, I didn't win. But hear me out: of the three people from the media group finishing ahead of me, one was a correspondent from <a class="reference external" href="http://www.mpt.org/motorweek/">Motorweek</a>, one was a professional racecar driver(!), and one was, uh, well, just better than me. But I'm pleased to report that I kicked the hell out of the 80 year-old guy from the Chinese-American Travel Association. All things considered, I'm pretty pleased with my performance. If you own a car and would like me to do terrible things to your brakes and tires, I stand ready.</p>
<p>I could've stuck around and tried the go-karts or drag-racing or ignite-the-open-vat-of-gasoline booth. Or talked to the &quot;NOS Energy Girls&quot;, I suppose. But I was ready to head home. On the way back I took a wrong turn, saw a fox and ended up in an overgrown cul de sac filled with weeds and Dharma Initiative-ish billboards emblazoned with the word JERICHO, but other than that the trip back was fine. I ended the day sweaty, exhausted and in posession of some extremely tacky Chevy promotional gear.</p>
<p>All in all, it was an overwhelming success. Car racing is almost as fun as it is stupid.</p>

1999-2007</div>
<p>Well, it had a good run, persisting through discoloration, chipped glass and the occasional vinegar cleaning. But it looks like my venerable coffeemaker has shed its mortal coil at last. He perked once or twice this morning, but then: terrible, terrible silence.</p>
<p>We were reduced to brewing the morning coffee with Charles' French press. I know that some of my sophisticated big-city friends may be tempted to go on and on about the merits of French-pressed coffee — its thickness, sweetness and exquisite and/or non-existent oiliness — and from there argue that I should embrace French pressing as the one true way to make coffee. But as far as I'm concerned the single most important attribute that a cup of coffee can possess is not being the last one. And on that score, the French press fails. Besides, it sounds oddly sexual.</p>
<p>So, sad as this occasion is, it's also a chance for rebirth. I'm going to get a new coffeemaker, and I could use some suggestions. As you might imagine, my natural inclination is to get something complicated and impractical that costs a lot of money and breaks almost immediately. I've already asked some of my friends and loved ones to repeat to me that this is a bad idea, but I could use your support as well.</p>
<p>It would be nice to hear about specific alternate coffeemakers, too. Emily's trying to sell me on a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Bunn-NHBX-B-Contemporary-10-Cup-Coffee/dp/B000FFQ4TG/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/002-0057764-8465667?ie=UTF8&amp;s=home-garden&amp;qid=1186849531&amp;sr=8-1">Bunn</a> coffeemaker — her family has one that she likes a lot. But to me, the brand recalls the time when my mom was a church secretary and I'd sometimes have to while away time in the building's basement, with the folding chairs and blank marriage certificates and brittle linoleum and alcoholics shuffling into a room down the hall and, yes, Bunn coffeemaker. That's not really the coffee lifestyle I want my purchase to evoke. The machines are also a little pricey for appliances that come with so much suburban despair attached.</p>
<p>No, as with all of my consumer purchases, I'd like my coffeemaker to come from the not-too-distant future (post-flying cars, pre-zombies), or, failing that, Asia. I'm thinking clean lines, stainless steel, and perhaps polyphonic ringtones and/or a blood pressure cuff.</p>
<p>I'd also sort of like to get one with a thermal carafe. People seem to like the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Zojirushi-EC-BD15-Thermal-Carafe-Coffee/dp/B0000X7CMQ/ref=pd_sbs_hg_5_img/002-0057764-8465667?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1186849531&amp;sr=8-2">Zojirushi EC-BD15</a>, and I certainly like pronouncing it. But I'm given pause by the relatively lukewarm reviews for the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Zojirushi-EC-BD15BA-Stainless-Thermal-Carafe/dp/B0001WDFBS/ref=pd_bbs_4/002-0057764-8465667?ie=UTF8&amp;s=home-garden&amp;qid=1186865140&amp;sr=8-4">EC-BD15BA</a> which is, as far as I can tell, completely identical except for having a slightly larger illustration on Amazon.com.</p>
<p>So I'm not quite sure how to proceed. If anyone's used a Zojirushi, owned a Zojirushi, or had a loved one horribly disfigured by an explosion of steam and shrapnel coming from a Zojirushi, please let me know. And if you can make a case for a different brand or absolutely essential feature, lay it on me.</p>

That's not even the most reprehensible intellectual property news of the day: <a class="reference external" href="http://yro.slashdot.org/yro/07/08/09/125203.shtml">via Slashdot</a> I see that <a class="reference external" href="http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/08/09/america/NA-GEN-US-Red-Cross-Lawsuit.php">Johnson &amp; Johnson is suing the Red Cross</a> for using... the red cross symbol. But it sounds like the Red Cross has <em>also</em> been misbehaving, licensing the symbol to businesses in a way that's disallowed by an old agreement between the RC and J&amp;J.</p>
<p>I realize that trademarks don't expire in the same way that patents and copyrights do, but surely there's a <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark#Maintaining_trademark_rights_.E2.80.94_abandonment_and_genericide">genericide</a> argument to be made here — I had no idea the red cross belonged to Johnson &amp; Johnson. I thought their mark was the intertwined Js that appear on their products, and that the cross was just generic decoration.</p>
<p>Who knows what the courts will decide. But it seems obvious to me that the symbol belongs in the public domain. Johnson &amp; Johnson shouldn't be dragging charities into court over it, and charities shouldn't be selling licenses that they aren't entitled to grant.</p>
