<p>I like how some of the shots of &quot;off-air&quot; talent are screencaps from on-air appearances. And how some of the contestants don't actually work in media at all. But the exclusion of certain perennial candidates is, of course, an outrage.</p>

                    <p>I think Tim's being just a bit disingenuous <a class="reference external" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/techliberation/~3/135144554/042577.php">here</a> when he discusses the relative competitiveness of the cell phone market:</p>
<blockquote>
Itâ€™s nonsensical to say thereâ€™s no competition because consumers only choose a wireless carrier once a year (or even once every two years). Most people donâ€™t buy computers, cars, or major appliances more often than that, yet no one claims that makes those industries uncompetitive. If consumers get crappy service during their contracts, they remember this fact and switch to a different carrier at the end of the contract period. And consumers comparison shop before they sign a contract, so phone companies have as much incentive to keep their prices low in a contract-based system as they would in a system without contracts.</blockquote>
<p>It's true that purchasing at intervals doesn't rule out competition. But this argument ignores a few salient points about this particular market.</p>
<p>Nearly all phones are locked, minimizing their resale value. Transferring your contact information between low-to-midrange phones is difficult or impossible. Until recently, you couldn't take your phone number with you (number portability is a much-loved big-government mandate that the carriers fought tooth &amp; nail). Although some carriers let you transfer your contract to someone else without paying an ETF, doing so while retaining your number is more than a little tricky, if not downright impossible. And of course, contracts typically last longer than a mobile phone's window of technological relevance, ensuring that these barriers will be in place until the phone is worth only a fraction of its initial value, needs a new lithium battery, and is generally headed for the donation bin.</p>
<p>All of these factors inhibit the emergence of a viable market for used cellphones and plans, which in turn allows the carriers to avoid some of the sorts of competitive pressures facing refrigerator and automobile manufacturers. Yes, they have an incentive to keep their prices low in a contract-based system — but only within the bounds of that system. It's as if NFL players collectively agreed to play touch football for a season and used their union's power to freeze out replacement players. There could still be competition, but it wouldn't be nearly as vicious as it would need to be to optimally serve the public.</p>
<p>There's also this:</p>
<blockquote>
The iPhone point also strikes me as especially silly. The iPhone is expensive because itâ€™s a cutting-edge gadget thatâ€™s been on the market less than a month. The fact that some of the cost comes in the form of a 2-year contract, as opposed to an up-front sticker price, is beside the point. If you think the iPhone, 2-year contract and all, is too expensive, buy a different phone. There are plenty to choose from.</blockquote>
<p>But the point Ars is making is that the iPhone actually <em>isn't</em> being subsidized by the contract fees. Consumers are buying the hardware at full retail price <em>and</em> being locked into a contract. This puts the lie to the carriers' argument that early termination fees are in place to avoid losses over hardware subsidies — they charge the fees whether there's a subsidy or not (and only one carrier will prorate this fee). Nor do customers have a way of opting out of this fraudulent system of portable phone paternalism. <a class="reference external" href="http://machinist.salon.com/feature/2007/07/18/cell_service_contracts/index.html">As Farhad Manjoo wrote yesterday</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
You can't offer to pay full price for a handset in exchange for a reduced early-termination fee and an unlocked phone -- no major firm will let you do that. Indeed, in some instances carriers will charge you a fee even when they don't offer you any break on the price of the phone. The iPhone is the primary exhibit: AT&amp;T doesn't subsidize the price of the phone, but you're still locked to a single provider.</blockquote>
<p>I'm currently facing an ETF from T-Mobile for an account I set up without receiving a handset (I used it for my now-defunct DCist SMS service). In retrospect I should've signed up with a prepaid service. That would've been fine for my application, but these services typically charge more for services and offer less advanced phones. They're designed for customers who are credit risks (or drug dealers!). Unlike in Europe, prepaid is clearly not a viable way to opt out of the contract system.</p>
<p>The actual reason the fees are in place is to prevent &quot;churn&quot; — the frequent switching between carriers by customers seeking better service, handsets or prices. Obviously this is a nuisance to carriers, and has real administrative costs. But surely the overhead to customer acquisition and early account termination is less than $150 (and if it is, surely it ought to be pro-rated when a customer has fulfilled part of their contract). No, the carriers are transparently using the fee to introduce friction into the marketplace, allowing them to extend the lifecycle of each generation of technology and spend more time in the pleasantly wide part of the margin that comes once they've paid off their capital investments.</p>
<p>There's nothing wrong with wanting to post nice fat profits, but I don't see a reason why we should enable this cartel-like activity. Customers will be better served by a faster-moving market. As it stands, customer dissatisfaction remains high across the industry, text messaging rates are going up rather than down and all customers with sub-smartphones remain locked into buying software exclusively from their carriers, despite countless forums filled with people vainly asking how to load mp3s as ringtones. And although the internet <a class="reference external" href="http://consumerist.com/consumer/audio/ted-stevens-wants-to-switch-between-phones-as-i-ride-my-motorcycle-277702.php">jumped all over Ted Stevens</a> for wanting a phone that would seamlessly rollover from wifi to cellular to landline access, his request wasn't unreasonable (well, except perhaps for the bit about the motorcycle) — VoIP/cell handing-off is useful technology that's been available for years, but is <a class="reference external" href="http://www.wifinetnews.com/archives/007735.html">just barely</a> showing up in the consumer marketplace.</p>
<p>It's simply not a very good or competitive market. Everybody hates it, and we ought to fix it. I have no idea whether a more open market would increase the total monthly expense of owning a cell phone. But even if it does, I suspect it would open up a lot of potential for growth of other industries — independent cellphone software, least-cost VoIP routing, third-party ringtones, better handsets, location-based services and who knows what else. Wireless data is a utility, not a retail product. Its market ought to be opened up.</p>

As you may recall, last year's contest featured a <a class="reference external" href="http://mediabistro.com/articles/poll/000091/result.asp">stunning come-from-behind victory</a> — one that unfortunately didn't count due to the deciding surge of democratic expression occurring in the 24 hours after voting closed. This in turn can be attributed to the parties responsible for the outpouring of support accidentally misreading the end date of the contest. I bet they felt pretty stupid about that.</p>
<p>But don't worry! I'm confident that democracy will triumph this year.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>Adrian Holovaty has just released a Python library called <a class="reference external" href="http://www.holovaty.com/blog/archive/2007/07/06/0128">templatemaker</a> that promises to make screen-scraping much easier.</p>
<p>Some explanation: if you're trying to do something automatically with a website, it's best if it has an API. This is a reliable, documented interface that your program can use to interact with the other site. Flickr has an API; Google has an API; del.icio.us has an API. Lots of sites have APIs.</p>
<p>But lots of sites don't. WMATA, for example, has none. In that situation you're stuck writing a program to parse the HTML of the site, which was designed to be viewed by humans, not robots. Here's a very simple made-up example. This table:</p>
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="54%" />
<col width="46%" />
</colgroup>
<thead valign="bottom">
<tr><th class="head">Time</th>
<th class="head">Line</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr><td>9:00 AM</td>
<td>Orange</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>1:00 PM</td>
<td>Blue</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Looks like so in HTML:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">&lt;table align=&quot;center&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; width=&quot;300&quot;&gt;</div>
<div class="line">&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Time&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Line&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;</div>
<div class="line">&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;9:00 AM&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Orange&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;</div>
<div class="line">&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;1:00 PM&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Blue&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;</div>
<div class="line">&lt;/table&gt;</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>And I can write some regular expression-laden Perl (or whatever) to extract info from it like so:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">while(my $l=&lt;&gt;)</div>
<div class="line">{</div>
<div class="line">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if($l =~ m/&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;(.*?)&lt;\/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;(.*?)&lt;\/td&gt;&lt;\/tr&gt;/i)</div>
<div class="line">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{</div>
<div class="line">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print &quot;train time is $1 and color is $2\n&quot;;</div>
<div class="line">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}</div>
<div class="line">}</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a pain in the ass. Worse, if WMATA decides they want to make some minor cosmetic changes — altering the background color of each odd-numbered result row, or changing to 24-hour time notation, or even just adding some line breaks to make their HTML more readable — the regular expression will break and have to be meticulously redesigned. And this is just a simple example; in reality the initial regex will be much more unwieldy and the fixes much harder to identify and make.</p>
<p>Holovaty's templatemaker aims to automate this by matching similar stretches of text, allowing it to determine which portions of a set of documents vary and which remain constant, then plucking the variable data out on the basis of its analysis. Some of that will be junk — you probably aren't actually interested in the breadcrumbs or meta tags in a set of pages, although they're quite likely to vary across the set — but with an intelligent look at the results, this could greatly speed up the process of extracting data.</p>
<p>Check out the <a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/p/templatemaker/">sample usage</a> for a simple example of what I'm talking about. I'm not much of a Python-lover, but I'm looking forward to using this project.</p>

                    <p>I sure didn't. Actually, my AP Government class mostly spent its time listening to the teacher rhapsodize about Teddy Roosevelt and watching tapes of Bill Press and Bob Novak facing off on an early incarnation of <em>Crossfire</em>.</p>
<p>I don't think my experience was unique. In fact, judging by the coverage of the current <a class="reference external" href="http://atrios.blogspot.com/2007_07_15_archive.html#3567467763734758492">filibuster/non-filibuster/filibuster-forcing-pre-filibuster</a>, it seems pretty clear that even those who should be among the best-informed observers of the political process have very little idea how parliamentary procedure works. Despite the fact that it's completely essential to understanding how things get done in the legislature, reporters tend to just fake their way through coverage of it. I'm beginning to wonder whether anyone outside of a tiny set of professional staffers actually understands how our government works.</p>
<p>It's all very, very strange. It might be time to update those Schoolhouse Rock cartoons into longer, more boring versions of the originals. And hey, as an added bonus, doing so will also provide additional material for a new wave of ironic t-shirt iron-ons two decades from now! It's win-win.</p>

<p>So cosmopolitan! Edgy, too — I <a class="reference external" href="http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/display.php?id=2008">hear</a> Adams Morgan is kind of a rough neighborhood.</p>
<p>With the Warehouse in trouble, this neighborhood actually does need some general-purpose space for art, music and events.

                    <p>Not to be a scold, but after yesterday I think I should emphasize: you might want to try to avoid getting migraines. I knew something strange was happening when the screen started swimming and I couldn't properly string together words for an IM conversation with <a class="reference external" href="http://cyrusfarivar.com/blog/">Cyrus</a>. This was mostly just confusing and interesting — I've been fascinated by aphasias, agnosias and other functional deficits ever since since I learned the <a class="reference external" href="http://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/chvision.html">blind spot trick</a>. But from there things quickly descended into a dull ache exacerbated by attempts to read. I finally gave up and went home, where a nap more or less set things right. But the back left side of my brain still felt worn out for the rest of the night, like the strip of grass in the middle of a soccer field.</p>
<p>Fortunately, this was unusual — I can only feel sorry for the folks afflicted with migraines on a chronic basis. In my case I can only conclude it was caused by — what else? — suspicious, out-of-the-ordinary coffee. I know, I know; even I'm having a hard time believing that explanation at this point. But I'm really at a loss for what else it could be.</p>

                    <p>Tech project the second! I aspire to participate in the comment threads over at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.unfogged.com">Unfogged</a>. There's really no better place on the internet for listening to people with PhDs talk about such weighty topics as <a class="reference external" href="http://www.unfogged.com/archives/week_2007_07_08.html#007138">fat celebrity paramours</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.unfogged.com/archives/week_2007_07_08.html#007148">bizarre Japanese pornography</a>.</p>
<p>But it's tough. The comments come in quick bursts. The only real way to participate in a thread is to keep it open in a browser window, manually refreshing every few seconds. Unless I'm stuck on a bus, I get bored when a slow spell hits. I move to a different web page or task. I come back and thirty messages have gone by, and the conversation has moved past a point where I would've liked to participate. Crap. There's comment RSS, but the interval at which RSS readers update is much too slow for it to be very useful.</p>
<p>What I need is push technology — something that does the checking for me, only bothers me when there's new content, and does so <em>fast</em>. So hey, I built something. It's a pretty simple IM bot hooked up to a script that checks the comment RSS a few times a minute (hopefully this is okay by the Unfoggitburo — I figure one script that resyndicates content could ultimately serve to <em>reduce</em> load).</p>
<p>Based on my not-very-rigorous testing, it seems to work fairly well. If you're interested, give it a shot and let me know what you think, and any improvements that you'd like to see.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Add &quot;Unfogged&quot; to your AIM buddy list. Having the bot as a buddy loosens some of the rate limits that might otherwise prevent it from sending messages.</li>
<li>Send the bot a message containing the URL for a particular Unfogged thread. You can use either the entry's permalink or the comment thread's link. You should get back an IM saying you're subscribed to the thread.</li>
<li>From this point on you'll get an IM whenever someone posts to the thread. To toggle your subscription off, send the URL again. You should get another message confirming that you've been unsubscribed.</li>
</ol>
<p>Disclaimers! The script is pretty rough:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>it doesn't daemonize</li>
<li>the Net::OSCAR package apparently can't deal with rate limits, so if it hits one who knows what'll happen</li>
<li>if it crashes it won't relaunch, and it's running off a somewhat flaky server in my living room</li>
<li>it won't send IMs faster than once every three seconds in order to avoid rate limits, so it may get backed up during peak periods</li>
<li>and of course, it could always go crazy and start sending you floods of IMs (if that happens, I suggest just blocking the AIM user — send me an email or comment, while you're at it)</li>
</ul>
<p>But at the moment it seems okay! If folks find it useful I'll polish it up, post the code and find it a better home.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Already found a bug! If the RSS parser finds an empty feed (which can occur if it queries it at the same moment as the feed's being rebuilt by MT), it craps out. I think I fixed the script, but I could be wrong. I'll have to have a closer look in the morning. I can confidently say I restarted it, which should let it work for a while, at least.</p>

                    <p>Tech project the first!: I've revisited my venerable <a class="reference external" href="http://www.dcist.com/map">DCist Map</a> project and ported it over to Google Mapplets — a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/07/11/google-to-launch-my-maps/">just-launched</a> feature that lets you add user-contributed mashups to your Google Map display in a wholly integrated way. This lets you do all kinds of neat stuff. For example, you can turn on a crime overlay by checking the &quot;crime overlay&quot; box. Then you could compare area muggings to gas prices by clicking the &quot;gas price&quot; checkbox. You'll be revolutionizing sociology in no time!</p>
<p>I've dusted off my code and ported it to the Mapplet version of the GMaps API, which actually entailed porting it to the GMaps v2 API first. It's nice of them to have finally un-switched latitude and longitude, but it made things kind of a pain in the ass for me. Still, it's nice to have it done and the tool up-to-date. Oh, and while I was at it I finally extended the yellow line up to Ft. Totten, as I should've long ago.</p>
<p>I've submitted the mapplet to Google's directory, but who knows when or if they'll add it. For now, if you want to add it to your &quot;My Maps&quot; toolbox, you can do so in the following way. You'll only have to do this once, then it should sit happily in your sidebar, waiting for you to toggle it on whenever you need it.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://maps.google.com/maps/mm?mapprev=1">Launch the mapplet-enabled version of Google Maps</a> (it's still in beta).</li>
<li>Click on &quot;Add content&quot; in the upper left of the &quot;My Maps&quot; section.</li>
<li>To the right of the search bar at the top of this page is a tiny little link that says &quot;Add by URL&quot;. Click it.</li>
<li>Enter &quot;<a class="reference external" href="http://dcist.com/map/mapplet.xml">http://dcist.com/map/mapplet.xml</a>&quot;. Note the lack of www! The Gothamist folks have set up the hostname to redirect to the www-less version, but Google isn't smart enough to handle that. Enter it like this and you'll be fine. Click &quot;Add&quot;.</li>
<li>Say &quot;OK&quot; to the security warning that'll pop up. Trust me, I'm a nice guy.</li>
<li>Follow the &quot;Back to Google Maps&quot; link in the upper left of the screen.</li>
<li>That's it! You should have a new item in the &quot;My Maps&quot; section. Check the box next to it and the metro overlay will be activated.</li>
</ol>
<p>I'll write up a post for DCist about this tomorrow (or maybe I'll wait to see if it's accepted into the directory). But I thought I'd put it up here first, so that you guys can give it a try and let me know if you run into any horrible problems.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> One other interesting side-effect: this makes it easy to see where Google and I disagree about a Metro station's location. In most cases this is because the station has multiple entrances; I usually went with whichever one was most visible. In others its because of different standards: I generally used the satellite view to find the platform and geocoded that (yeah, I did them all manually). Google appears to use street entrances. I'd consider redoing them, but it'd mostly be for pride — having both on there is (arguably) the best solution.</p>

                    <p>Alright, it was a little crowded and hot, at least one channel could be counted on to be clipping until 2/3 of the way through each song, and somebody standing near me seemed to have had a big meal of chili and corn nuts immediately before coming to DC9 (my personal recommendation: <a class="reference external" href="http://www.oyamel.com/">grasshopper tacos</a> — the taste is just okay, but the horrifying-your-girlfriend potential is pretty solid).</p>
<p>Still, that was a fine, fine rock show. Congratulations to <a class="reference external" href="http://blogstretch.blogspot.com">Amanda</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.informationleafblower.com">Kyle</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://cruelsommer.blogspot.com">Sommer</a> for another wildly successful Unbuckled.</p>
<p>But I think we need a new term for whatever genre of music Le Loup belongs to, or aspires to belong to. Along with Arcade Fire, the Polyphonic Spree, Broken Social Scene and who knows who else, this is a band that clearly has a ridiculous number of members, but somehow manages to use them to productive ends. And there are jammy elements, but I'd hate to call any of them jam bands. And there's a lot of melodrama, but — well, okay, there's just a lot of melodrama, I just don't care. I belong to a generation that shed tears when Optimus Prime died — I'm always ready to be emotionally manipulated.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>I've been a bad blogger recently, but I've got a few semi-nifty technical projects in the works. Hopefully I'll be able to wrap one or two of em up tonight; stay tuned.</p>
<p>Also, the tag links aren't working anymore, if anyone cares — looks like Google crawling them was slowing down my webhost's machine so much that they disabled it. I'll probably just ditch the tags completely.</p>

                    <p>I suppose <a class="reference external" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2007/07/09/scene-dc-bloggy-types-ro_n_55432.html">this writeup</a> is making Friday's show still relevant, so I may as well put up the post that the demands of wedding-attendance preempted.</p>
<p>First, it was great, and you should check out <a class="reference external" href="http://www.informationleafblower.com">Kyle's</a> <a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/leafblower/sets/72157600719786699/">amazing photos</a> of the show.</p>
<p>Second, the two bands I saw — Middle Distance Runner and Georgie James — both struck me as having a similar quirk: dueling songwriters. It's not an uncommon phenomenon, certainly, but it seemed particularly obvious in these two cases.</p>
<p>I don't know much about MDR, having had to leave their Unbuckled appearance early, but it was pretty easy to see that their songs come in two flavors. First, catchy pop that occasionally aspires to Bends-era Radioheadishness, and which is strangely lacking in bridges (seriously guys, key changes: they're good for what ails ya). Second, garage/stomp/Kings of Leon-style rock, the kind of stuff played by shirtless dudes in jeans and mesh caps who spend a lot of time trying to shop for belt buckles without anyone noticing them doing it. I'm not a huge fan of the latter and so couldn't tell you whether MDR's take on it is particularly good or not. But I really liked the songs of type A.</p>
<p>Georgie James has this sort of split personality, too. John writes angular pop songs (angular — what a fantastically cliched music critic word), while Laura's melodies seem to be more about mellow, bouncy notes tumbling over one another. I like John's hooks better, but although he has a very nice voice, Laura's clearly the one with the distinctive vocals and charisma (also: she's purty). It was nice to hear them making larger (though still tentative) forays into one another's songs on their older material, but I was surprised to see how divided their styles remained.</p>
<p>Of course, I haven't seen the songwriting credits on their demo EP or their unreleased album, so perhaps I'm just imagining a division where none actually exists. But in my mind, at least, the band's got two distinct styles. Each one has a lot to recommend it, but I'm looking forward to hearing more stuff that capitalizes on both.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> While you're at it, why not go check out the first song from <a class="reference external" href="http://www.myspace.com/bulletsdc">Bullets</a>, the newest band in the great Q &amp; Not U diaspora. Pretty catchy, although I've gotta say that the <em>Purple Rain</em> screengrab may be overkill.</p>

                    <p>I've pretty much completed my survey of phone options, and the news is not good. The <a class="reference external" href="http://www.helio.com/#devices_ocean">Ocean</a>'s keyboard isn't very good, its browser is hopelessly neutered and it crashed twice while I was using it. The <a class="reference external" href="http://t-mobile.com/shop/phones/Detail.aspx?device=acc8102d-4506-4eaa-bc2f-9c7b8ec1b1e0">Wing</a> is junky and also crashed while I was using it — Windows Mobile seems pretty awful. The <a class="reference external" href="http://t-mobile.com/shop/phones/Detail.aspx?device=f164419f-eee9-4cf6-a1bd-070dbe4b5023">Dash</a> has some style and an okay keyboard, but the store clerks were wary of it. And although it's clear that it's probably underpowered (despite its custom edition of Windows Mobile seeming pretty snappy), it's hard to say exactly how that limitation would manifest itself. &quot;Inconveniently&quot; is my guess.</p>
<p>Besides, I really don't want to be forced to commit to two more years on America's slowest data network. The iPhone's beautiful, but if I were to spend that much money I'd want a less flaky keyboard, an SSH client and the ability to tether my laptop to it. I'm confident that software revisions (and perhaps an SDK) will make the device unassailably awesome, but for now I'm content to wait.</p>
<p>So yes, I'm a broken man — despite yesterday morning's wide-eyed telephonic optimism, I'm now trolling Craigslist and Ebay for used Sidekick 3s. The handset is a disappointment, to be sure: no maps, no video, no tethering, and Danger inexplicably makes their keyboards worse with every device revision. But it still offers the best keyboard out there, a fairly responsive and nearly-uncrashable operating system, and the promise of resuming normal Tom-phone activities until the iPhone pressures the market into making better devices. Here's to maintaining the status quo.</p>

I guess I'm probably behind on all of this, but I found it interesting and, as someone who's at least had offsets purchased on their behalf, personally relevant. The upshot seems to be that you can't just buy $1 worth of carbon non-release. Your money's actually pushing the margins of where it makes sense for companies to implement clean technologies — projects that they were considering doing for reasons unrelated to climate change. It's not clear whether traders are doing a good job of actually getting the money where it can best tip those scales, though, or whether it's just a case of a smattering of environmentally beneficial projects having their profit margins inflated at random. It's also unclear how much of the transaction the brokers are pocketing.</p>

The screen had been misbehaving for a while, occasionally displaying useless garbage instead of meaningful content like Twitter messages about what people in California had for dinner. Flipping the screen up and down usually solved the problem, but not anymore. First it was stuck as gibberish; now it just doesn't show anything. I'm stuck with the aged t39m (monochrome!) pictured on the right.</p>
<p>So I guess I'd better get a new phone, huh? The iPhone's appearance is a little too recent, and my need to pay $200 to cancel a contract (I have two T-Mobile accounts thanks to LastCall) means that it's out of my price range.

But mostly it looks like what the Sidekick 3 should have been, except with a lousier keyboard. The lack of an SSH client gives me pause — it's pretty awesome to fix a website from your phone — but I imagine I can work out some horribly-insecure alternative with an IM interface or a Java applet. I plan commandeer my officemates' phones tomorrow — as a web developer I'm officially sanctioned with that power, and both the iPhone and Ocean are represented — then I guess I'll take the plunge.</p>
<p>Unless someone tells me that's a horrible idea, of course. Anybody?</p>
<p><strong>OH YEAH:</strong> I should point out that although my venerable t39m is an excellent phone, it's a terrible everything else. So don't send me text messages until I get this worked out, if you don't mind — there's pretty much no chance I'll retrieve them on this thing.</p>
