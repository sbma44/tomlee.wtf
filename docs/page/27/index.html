                    <p>Ryan and I have been going back and forth <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ryanavent.com/blog/?p=1335#comment-92836">in his comments</a> about the likelihood of carsharing services going electric. I think it's unlikely because they'd have to spend too much time charging; he thinks they're a good candidate for early rollout of the charging infrastructure necessary for such a switch. Most recently he said:</p>
<blockquote>
In practice, this could be achieved incrementally. Tweak business models over a ten year period through which you slowly switch from gas engines to plug-in hybrids to all electric, over which period, presumably, battery technology slowly improves. Neednâ€™t be done all at once.</blockquote>
<p>I think this is a point that's worth making here and at some length: &quot;presum[ing that] battery technology improves&quot; is setting yourself up for failure.</p>
<p>In truth, there have only been a few noteworthy improvements in battery tech during Ryan and my lifetimes: longer-lived NiCd and NiMH batteries; some improvement in alkaline batteries; and the popularization of lithium batteries. But look closer and you'll realize that most of these aren't actually battery innovations, per se: they're benefits of the microprocessor revolution. Cheap, smart charging circuitry allowed us to avoid memory effects; to balance load across cells; and to monitor lithium cells' temperature and voltage as they charge so that they don't catch fire (well... <a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeWq6rWzChw">usually</a>), thereby finally making lithium a viable option for consumer electronics. Those are all important developments, but at this point we've wrung about as much as we can out of charging our batteries more cleverly.</p>
<p>None of this has done much to improve the fundamental energy storage densities of the underlying chemistries. These have been known for a long time now, and nothing is going to change them — <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_of_standard_electrode_potentials">nor are there any more promising elements like lithium</a> waiting to be tamed (well, none that aren't radioactive, anyway). The glacial pace of improvement in battery technology really can't be overemphasized. The lead-acid battery was developed in 1859, for pete's sake. It's really heavy relative to the energy it stores, can produce explosive fumes if overcharged, and sometimes requires the addition of distilled water. Yet it's still the best battery technology we have for supplying the high current necessary to turn over an engine. A century and a half and we haven't come up with anything better!</p>
<p>It may <em>seem</em> like batteries have improved dramatically — consider the lifespan of an iPod Nano versus a portable cassette player. But this is misleading. In fact it's a byproduct of more energy-efficient technologies. Which isn't to dismiss energy effiency! But electric motors are already <em>extremely</em> efficient. And when it comes to vehicles, we're unfortunately dealing with hard physical limits related to how much energy it takes to move a car. So long as we're committed to EVs being able to perform like and drive safely near gasoline-powered cars, we will find ourselves with less room for improvement than people would like to think.</p>
<p>I don't mean to be a downer, but it's difficult to overstate what a serious problem this is, or for how long it's been one. Hydrocarbons are an unbelievably efficient way to store energy when compared to electrochemical cells, and I seriously doubt anything will change that. Hopefully I'll be proven wrong. But smart people have been working on the battery problem for decades and decades, propelled by the lure of the financial bonanza that a breakthrough would represent. And while they've made impressive improvements, none come anywhere close to competing with gasoline's energy density. We're still <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_density#Energy_density_in_energy_storage_and_in_fuel">an order of magnitude away</a>.</p>
<p>Now of course there are always fuel cells. And nanotech's vast surface areas may deliver unexpected breakthroughs. But a bet that counts on a better battery is still a very, very bad wager.</p>

Perhaps my intemperate comments were motivated by jealousy. After all, it's not like you can buy Utz Chili Half Smoke Chips. The Crab Chip belongs to Baltimore; maybe I only think I don't want it because I know it can never truly be mine.</p>
<p>But the point of <a class="reference external" href="/2008/08/14/we-will-not-speak-of-the-ketchup-chip/">that post</a> stands! On Friday night, thanks to Ficke and Becks' generous snack-procurement, I had some Crab Chips back to back with Carolina Style BBQ Chips. I may have underestimated the Crab Chip, but Carolina BBQ remains the superior snack food.</p>

                    <p>Emily Gould, whose name I continue to be unable to read without thinking of <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goa%27uld">evil alien parasites</a>, has an article in <a class="reference external" href="http://www.technologyreview.com/Infotech/21251/page1/">Technology Review</a>, of all places, in which she continues her new career as a professional haver of mixed feelings about the internet.</p>
<p>Specifically, she's talking about <a class="reference external" href="http://arstechnica.com/articles/culture/book-review-2008-04-1.ars/1">Clay Shirky's book</a>, which she characterizes more or less fairly as a triumph of internet triumphalism — one that's impressive, of course, but which ignores (of course) the ineffable something or other that we're all losing in this topsy-turvy world.</p>
<blockquote>
Like an expatriate who reads every new novel that's set in her homeland, I read books about the Internet to remember the time I spent working and living there, to contrast my memories with the authors' impressions and see how well they hold up. In Shirky's descriptions of the way new Web-based social tools are restructuring businesses, communities, and relationships, I recognize familiar scenery. He knows what he's talking about--he's lived there too. You get the sense, though, that he's somehow managed to avoid walking down any dark alleys, or staring too long at any piles of fetid garbage.</blockquote>
<p>To make her case she invokes <a class="reference external" href="http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/ge/benjamin.htm">Walter Benjamin's famous essay The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction</a>, which I probably should already be familiar with but in fact just read this morning.</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Shirky even believes that technology is creating and enabling &quot;love&quot;; when he talks about the hundreds of thousands of people who are collaboratively building Wikipedia, he says they &quot;love one another in its context.&quot; He fails to mention--or maybe he fails to notice--that the &quot;love&quot; and &quot;freedom&quot; he describes don't mean quite what they did back when our meat acquaintances outnumbered our Facebook &quot;friends.&quot;</div>
<div class="line">Maybe, in the same way that Benjamin says the difference between &quot;follow[ing] with the eye, while resting on a summer afternoon, a mountain range on the horizon&quot; and experiencing that same mountain range at a remove (imagine a picture postcard) makes it harder to appreciate the real thing (&quot;Gosh, this mountain is beautiful! Just like a postcard!&quot;), social-media technologies are creating simulacra of social connection, facsimiles of friendship. By ignoring that difference, as Shirky mostly does, we keep moving heedlessly toward a future where the basic human social activities that these new technologies are modeled on--talking, being introduced to new people by friends--are threatened.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>But Gould is simplifying what Benjamin actually says. His essay's most relevant portions concern the changing nature of art in the face of technology that can reproduce it. And yes, he says that something is lost:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Even the most perfect reproduction of a work of art is lacking in one element: its presence in time and space, its unique existence at the place where it happens to be. This unique existence of the work of art determined the history to which it was subject throughout the time of its existence.</div>
<div class="line">[...]</div>
<div class="line">One might subsume the eliminated element in the term &quot;aura&quot; and go on to say: that which withers in the age of mechanical reproduction is the aura of the work of art.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>This isn't just wistfulness, though. Sure, Benjamin notes with sadness the loss of opportunities for considering art on its own terms, rather than the mass-production-enabled use of it as grist for the culture's neverending cocktail party chatter. But he also notes aura's exclusivity and the elitism that's only possible through scarcity. He's not bemoaning the decline of aura, per se, just observing it. Dude's a Marxist — the democratization afforded by reproduction and the &quot;emancipa[tion of] the work of art from its parasitical dependence on ritual&quot; is right up his alley.</p>
<p>So here's where Gould gets it wrong. Yes, there is something missing from online interactions. But that's not some privileged insight about the nature of our new, electronic world — it's the most basic one. Worse, it's a dead end. Noting the validity of holisticism is fine, but the only place you can go from there is mysticism, and that's no use to anybody.</p>
<p>Gould thinks Shirky is a callow idealist, but he's not. He's just noting the incredible bounty that technology can afford us while politely declining to complain about the places where it falls short.</p>
<p>Not only is Gould preoccupied with the latter, she's blind to the former. And hey, I can relate. Digital technology has its own Benjaminian aura, you know — excitement born of novelty, and exclusivity, and revolutionary rhetoric. Once that novelty wears off, though, things can start to look kind of drab. I mean, it's exciting that the world has collaboratively built an encyclopedia! But it <em>is</em> an encyclopedia. And the idea of an encyclopedia — a comprehensive reference document written without passion or position — is actually kind of boring. The same holds for social communication and our lofty rhetoric about the triumph of a world where information can flow freely. Once you're done patting yourself on the back you need to start paying attention to what people are actually <em>saying</em>. And that's hard. Sometimes it's even boring.</p>
<p>It's depressing when you realize how much of your excitement about a thing was tied up in its aura; to find out that superficial considerations formed the basis of your enthusiasm. I struggle with this myself: I'm overcome with contempt at every useless, vowel-less internet startup I see, its founders desperate to think of themselves as brilliant revolutionaries despite no one — least of all them — actually caring a whit about what they say they're trying to <em>do</em>. But that contempt is motivated in no small part by feeling the exact same ignoble impulse.</p>
<p>But this is my own failing, and, I suspect, Gould's. It doesn't make any less important those advances, the ones we thought we believed in. It just means that we overstated their importance in the first place, or exaggerated our level of interest in them as we fell in love with their aura. Either way it was self-flattery, and we have only ourselves to blame.</p>

<p>The early signs at last night's Hold Steady show were not good. A group of fans had shown up wearing &quot;Unified Scene Drinking Team&quot; softball shirts. And while I couldn't say exactly what Craig Finn had in mind when he invented the first half of that phrase, I was pretty sure it didn't involve flipcup.</p>
<p>The opening act compounded the problem. Homogenous pop/punk with a Bosstones scream — they weren't my thing, really, although a lot of the crowd liked them. Tuning out early gave me plenty of time to think about why the Hold Steady had given them an opening slot. I concluded that it wasn't the band, it was the idea of the band — they were joyful and enthusiastic. And visually, they covered all the bases: there were a couple of tattooed rap/rock fireplugs, an asymptotically skinny indie boy, a nerd-rock drummer peering through dirty hair and ludicrous glasses, and a little keyboard-playing white girl in a pretty Motown dress. My friend Chris summed it up well when he said they looked like a rock band from The Sims.</p>
<p>Which left me in an awkward position. As much as anything the Hold Steady have built themselves on a downright mythic idea of rock and roll and the people that listen to it. I can't say I've ever been a part of a scene like that, but it always sounded pretty good to me. Now I was standing there, staring at what I could only take to be a living shorthand for what they'd had in mind, and it was a cartoon. Suddenly I was in a crowd of fellow fucking tourists, wondering if I'd be wearing a softball jersey, too, if I'd been born into the wrong online neighborhood.</p>
<p>But then the band took to the stage and I realized what you probably already have: this is all ridiculous. Their stories are too good, the music's too good, to get tangled up in worry over authenticity. By the end of the first song Craig Finn had made us toast Joe Strummer, and I found I didn't even care if, for the people around me, the honoree wasn't any more real than Charlemagne or Holly. Their hands stayed up after the toast, and that turned out to be the important thing.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The show wasn't recorded, but the band did a set from this tour on World Cafe, and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.captainsdead.com/2008/06/23/sometimes-she-partied-with-townies/">you can listen to or download it here</a>.

<p>I meant to post this important news earlier, but forgot. Now, shocked back into attention by an outpouring of public interest on Flickr (a comment was left), let me try to make up for lost time.</p>
<p>It has, <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potato_chip#Seasoned_chips">according to Wikipedia</a>, taken us almost a century to get here. But we have arrived at a solution: Carolina-style Utz chips. These are the chips, people.</p>
<p>I realize that regional pride might propel some of you toward Crab Chips. But you're better than that. Crab Chips are a mirthless joke, an exaggerated accent, a story they tell to tourists.</p>
<p>The Carolina-style chip is a precise equation, a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.uni-kassel.de/fb14/stahlbau/tensegrity/tens.html">tensegrity tower</a> constructed from flavored powder: half barbecue, half salt &amp; vinegar. Its elegance cannot be overstated, although that elegance may not be completely apparent if you cram them into your mouth with the same enthusiasm I do.</p>

<p>It certainly looks, um, more... frugal? Maybe those who know something about architecture will be able to defend it on the merits. I don't know anything about these matters, but I can see how some might think the earlier, prettier design is less <em>interesting</em>. Or maybe the second one really is the trainwreck it appears to be.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>Around work I'm known as something of a Movable Type apologist. I can't help it — it's how I was raised. MT was the first thing I tried to install <a class="reference external" href="http://www.zunta.org/blog/archives/2002/08/28/narcissism_what/">six years ago</a> when I decided to check out the burgeoning blogging phenomenon, back when the media was merely interested in, rather than terrified of, the whole business.</p>
<p>Movable Type's greatest strength is handling traffic, which of course is not something I've ever really needed it for. When you make a change to a site MT picks up all the data you've entered, passes it through your templates and generates a plain ol' HTML file, which it then plops in the appropriate directory. It also updates a few other files, like your site's main page. But these are similarly static (by &quot;static&quot; I mean a page that doesn't ask the server to do any computation as it's served). As you might imagine, serving static pages is a relatively easy task for a webserver — all the computational cost of composing a page is incurred once, when it's created, and the result is saved. The overhead for each subsequent page-serving is consequently as small as it can be. This is what makes MT good at dealing with traffic.</p>
<p>But the system that does this is built on unappealingly old, slow technology. And besides, there are good reasons for wanting dynamic functionality on a page. You can create a hybrid sort of site — this blog is an example, as it uses a lot of PHP in its MT templates — but it's a little awkward to build and maintain. You can extend the core MT system, too, but it's not always well-suited to the task. Over the past few years I've watched as the folks at Gothamist, with the help of <a class="reference external" href="http://apperceptive.com/">Apperceptive</a>, have done this time and again, cajoling MT into accomplishing things that it really has no interest in doing. Sometimes I've been frustrated by this process; other times I've been impressed. Either way, their efforts can be fairly described as heroic. But if they were using a different platform there wouldn't be a need for quite as much heroism. I suspect this wouldn't be a bad thing.</p>
<p>Now <a class="reference external" href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20080813-movable-type-pro-to-meld-blogging-and-social-networking.html">Ars</a>, acting uncharacteristically like a press release proxy, brings word of MT 4.2 Pro. Despite the enthusiastic writeup, the announcement leaves me about ready to call it a day on MT. Not that I'll stop using it, mind you — porting this blog would be a pain — but it's clear that its time is done. Six Apart is already retreating from the stab at openness that they made with MT4. And the warmed-over social networking features that they're now offering feel just a bit desperate. There is nothing here that can't be easily accomplished with <a class="reference external" href="http://mu.wordpress.org/about">Wordpress MU</a> or <a class="reference external" href="http://drupal.org">Drupal</a>.</p>
<p>And that's alright. I'm glad to see those other (free) projects ascendant: Wordpress has managed to harness its community's enthusiasm for writing some of the world's worst PHP code and turned it into a successful, professional product that's actually well-engineered (if subject to more security bulletins than I'd like to see). With the caching technologies it has available, there's no longer a great reason for using MT.</p>
<p>And Drupal — well, I spend so much time with Drupal that my feelings are inevitably mixed. But I'd take it any day over Movable Type (and Wordpress, for that matter).</p>
<p>I'm glad to keep a hand in MT. It's a very different system than those other blogging platforms, and that's probably good for me. But it's no longer possible to make a great case on its behalf. The only thing it has going for it is the company behind it: if you buy a commercial license you can call up Six Apart and yell at them in a way that isn't possible with non-corporate projects. That's certainly enough to build a business on — ask Redhat. But in terms of total yelling <em>period</em>, I'm ready to concede defeat on behalf of MT proponents everywhere.</p>

                    <p>Not a deep thought by any means, but jesus is it embarrassing the extent to which two cups of coffee act to alter my mood. I don't just mean providing pep and vigor; I mean lifting the veil from my eyes, restoring my hope for the future and engagement with the present, and generally making me into what I flatter myself to say is at least a semi-tolerable human being.</p>
<p>Whatever handicaps an adolescence spent playing Starfox and going to debate tournaments may have saddled me with, the experience at least shielded me from some dangerously cool compounds, and for that I should probably be grateful. I don't think I've got the neurochemistry to handle anything more exotic than what can be found in the break room.</p>
