                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>Earlier tonight I tweeted something snide about &quot;Big Data.&quot; &nbsp;Some people actually replied! &nbsp;This was a useful reminder that Twitter is not just a black hole into which bile can be thrown. &nbsp;It also made me realize that I should probably explain my thinking a bit more.</p>
<p>At this point, I consider software development to be a trade. &nbsp;It's easy to pretend otherwise, what with so many of us having degrees in computer &quot;science&quot; and the fact -- often only apparent to practitioners -- that a program's implementation can reflect an aesthetic sensibility. &nbsp;But in truth those of us who work in the industry perform tasks that are a lot more like the work of an electrician or plumber than that of a sculptor or theoretical physicist. We apply a relatively small number of solutions to an almost infinite landscape of problems. &nbsp;There's still plenty of room for variation and artistry in the execution -- there's more than one way to skin a cat -- but it really is about deploying specialized tools to solve applied engineering problems.</p>
<p>Ted Dziuba once wrote something like &quot;scalability is the problem that every software engineer wishes he had, and ten actually do.&quot; &nbsp;There's something to this, but it's a bit unfair to the people who wish they had the problem. &nbsp; A run-of-the-mill web developer studying scalability is a bit like a construction carpenter studying Amish furniture making techniques. &nbsp;Is it relevant to his work? &nbsp;Well, strictly speaking, no. &nbsp;He just needs to be able to tack up frames so the drywall guys can come by. &nbsp;Still, if you're choosing which carpenter to hire to help build a townhouse, it might not be a bad idea to pick the guy who's interested in learning about dovetail joints and how to build a dresser without using any nails or screws. &nbsp;To be clear: this is not where the guy's talents are actually needed. &nbsp;He could be rebuilding houses in Haiti, or New Orleans, or wherever. &nbsp;There are plenty of problems that need his skills. &nbsp;Still, there's nothing wrong with a guy taking pride and interest in his craft.</p>
<p>And that's about where we are with software developers interested in scalability, or Big Data, or whatever. &nbsp;Interest in esoteric topics is healthy! &nbsp;It shows that a person is engaged and anxious to learn. &nbsp;A very few of those people actually will need to build dovetail joints someday. &nbsp;And yeah, they could probably just learn once the need arises. &nbsp;But it's not a particularly grievous misallocation of resources for them to learn now instead of later.</p>
<p>But things get a little dodgier once you get beyond this circle of technologist self-betterment. &nbsp;It is not particularly helpful, for instance, to start writing news stories about how the future of carpentry is the phase-out of screws, and how in the future no firm that hasn't prepared itself and its employees for the screwless economy is going to be able to compete. &nbsp;It's just not true. &nbsp;Some smart people are interested in this stuff, but that doesn't mean it's about to transform the industry.</p>
<p>So, look: Big Data. &nbsp;Do some people genuinely deal with this class of problem? &nbsp;Yes, some do. &nbsp;Many more, myself included, wish they did: I get as excited as anybody else by the idea of marshaling huge quantities of information to reach interesting conclusions! &nbsp;The problem here is really just the &quot;big&quot; part. &nbsp;Computers are <em>so</em> powerful. &nbsp;How big does a problem need to be before a single machine is an impractical solution? &nbsp;The answer is: very, very, VERY big. &nbsp;For instance, I've got the last ten years of federal spending data on the laptop on which I'm typing this. &nbsp;That's about 31 million rows of data. &nbsp;That's a lot! &nbsp;But it's still nowhere near the point where I'd need to pursue exotic optimizations for my queries. &nbsp;Most startups do not do as much business as the federal government; and most well-designed systems don't need to constantly query a huge working set of data. &nbsp;I can't help but wonder whether we'd be better off spending more time teaching each other how to run regressions, or just calculate a confidence interval (how big do you need that data to be before you can arrive at a decent answer, anyway?).</p>
<p>But this is just my own sense of the matter. &nbsp;The fact is that I don't do a ton of work in this area. &nbsp;Perhaps I'm way off-base here! &nbsp;But I kind of get the sense that engineers are getting excited about interesting things, and others are concluding that those interesting things are <em>broadly important</em> things. &nbsp;It's not always so.</p>

</p><p>Halloween is kind of a big deal for me. This year I was sad not to be able to throw an enormous party, but it did give me an opportunity to put some more thought into my costume than usual.</p>
<p>I always go as something comic-book-related; typically I go as a super-villain (I broke that tradition last year and sort of regretted doing so). In the past I've chosen characters based on my personal affinity for them and a balance between the feasibility and potential awesomeness of the costume. I kind of ignored that this time. This year I went as Dr. Manhattan. Like every other self-respecting geek, I love <em>Watchmen</em>, and there were some personal resonances that made me want to go as doc.</p>
<p>I'm supposed to be dressed <a class="reference external" href="/static/2010/10/31/watchmen_source-20101031-202344.png">the way Dr. Manhattan was when he made a TV appearance in the comic</a>. There isn't anything particularly important about that scene -- it's just the only one where he isn't naked (I wasn't <em>that</em> committed to the project).</p>
<p>I think people tend to have a confused reaction to Dr. Manhattan when reading the book. It's very tempting to view him as a sympathetic character. For one thing, he's omnipotent, and people naturally find themselves sucking up to all-powerful authority figures. Also, his backstory does make him something of a victim. Finally, he's helpless -- in a sense -- and people mistake helplessness for innocence. But this is a bad judgment. In truth the guy's actions are abhorrent both before and after his self-imposed exile. So I feel comfortable including him in the &quot;villain&quot; costume list.</p>
<p>At any rate, the costume was well-received, though most often as &quot;blue man&quot; or &quot;blue man group&quot; (on the way home a woman yelled out to me that her brother-in-law is an <em>actual</em> blue man group blue man, an admission that I think left us both embarrassed). Choosing a costume that's so thoroughly makeup-based is definitely a pain in the ass -- I think it'll be a few years before I go down that road again. And to be honest, people mostly just liked the contact lenses: they worked great, thoroughly disturbed people, and seem not to have blinded me. And hey! <a class="reference external" href="http://www.bodyjewelleryshop.com/online_store/white-mesh-contact-lenses-pair.cfm">At a mere $25</a>, I think they're well worth the investment. A+++, would stick into my eyes again.</p>

                    <p>I think it's safe to say I'm not a social media triumphalist.&nbsp; But <a class="reference external" href="http://mashable.com/2010/10/20/washington-post-tells-journalists-not-to-engage-on-twitter/">this is silly</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week, some Post staffers responded to outside critics via our main Twitter account. At issue was a controversial piece we’d published online. The intent in replying was to defend the decision to publish the piece, but it was misguided both in describing our rationale for publishing the piece and as a matter of practice. It shouldn’t have been sent.</p>
<p>Even as <strong>we encourage everyone in the newsroom to embrace social media and relevant tools</strong>, it is absolutely vital to remember that <strong>the purpose of these Post branded accounts is to use them as a platform to promote news, bring in user generated content and increase audience engagement with Post content</strong>. No branded Post accounts should be used to answer critics and speak on behalf of the Post, just as you should follow our normal journalistic guidelines in not using your personal social media accounts to speak on behalf of the Post.</p>
<p>Perhaps it would be useful to think of the issue this way: <strong>when we write a story, our readers are free to respond and we provide them a venue to do so</strong>. We sometimes engage them in a private verbal conversation, but once we enter a debate personally through social media, this would be equivalent to allowing a reader to write a letter to the editor–and then publishing a rebuttal by the reporter. It’s something we don’t do. Please feel free to flag Marcus, Liz and me when you see something out there that you think deserves a response from the Post. As we routinely do, we will work with Kris Coratti and her team to respond when appropriate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Emphasis mine.</p>
<p>So: you're free to use social media to spam people -- a strategy sure to reap long-term success -- and readers are free to wade into the cesspools of racism and reactionary thought that are newspaper web comment sections, where their contributions will be utterly ignored by everyone.</p>
<p>That's just not how it works.&nbsp; This is a fundamental problem, and one that all the Chief Innovation Officers and Social Media Strategists and Vice Presidents of Thinking Outside the Box at big firms will eventually find themselves unable to deal with.&nbsp; The things that make new media compelling make message discipline impossible.</p>
<p>People have been fooled into thinking it can be otherwise by some unreproducible early successes.&nbsp; It's true that if your early-adopter employees happen to be talented spokespeople for your organization, everything will be fine.&nbsp; This actually happens sometimes!&nbsp; Look at Major Nelson or Comcast Frank or Robert Scoble.</p>
<p>But as disintermediating mediums expand to include the meaty part of the employee-competence bell curve, it becomes increasingly unwise to rely on that kind of luck.&nbsp; To whatever extent message discipline is important to your organization -- and it is, to varying degrees, for every organization -- you really do have to choose between the exciting possibilities that social media represents and exposing the true nature of your workforce.</p>
<p>Personally, I think that's all to the good.&nbsp; I don't think it's any great tragedy that the callous idiocy behind the Post's decision to publish an anti-gay bigot in its pages was accidentally highlighted.&nbsp; But hey, if the organization is keen to use regimented silence to disguise the abhorrence of its op-ed decisions for a few more years, it's within its rights and abilities to do so.&nbsp; It's just a little silly to pretend you can have it both ways.</p>
<p>(I should note that the memo is less severe than it's been billed: the narrow language used pertains to Post-branded Twitter accounts, not writers' personal accounts.&nbsp; Still, it's hard to imagine that distinction persisting for long.)</p>

                    <p>It's a very good movie. You should go see it.&nbsp; I don't have much more to say about it than that.</p>
<p>What I do want to observe, though, is that the reaction to the movie on Twitter has been fascinating.&nbsp; A surprising number of people are leaping to Zuckerberg's defense.&nbsp; Many are linking to <a class="reference external" href="http://gawker.com/5643915/mark-zuckerberg-describes-the-dirty-tricks-that-led-to-the-facebook-movie">this account</a> of the legal maneuvering dramatized by the film -- an account which doesn't actually exculpate Zuckerberg, but is written as if the author thinks it does.&nbsp; Even more astounding are posts like <a class="reference external" href="http://alexpriest.com/2010/10/04/perhaps-the-digital-divide-is-much-bigger-than-we-thought/">this one</a>, which lionize Zuckerberg as a sort of Nietzschean hero.</p>
<p>It's all a little weird.&nbsp; People clearly have reservoirs of affection for and identification with the founder of Facebook. Presumably this is because of what his invention means to them.&nbsp; I suppose that's fine.</p>
<p>But let me offer my predictable cranky technologist perspective.&nbsp; Zuckerberg is wildly successful, and I don't begrudge him that.&nbsp; Nor do I find myself particularly outraged on behalf of the various people he seems to have betrayed, all of whom are now even more astoundingly wealthy than they started out being.</p>
<p>There's a strange tendency in this country to declare everyone who's <em>extremely rich</em> to be some sort of visionary genius, whose unprecedented perspective allowed a break from the chains of history.&nbsp; This is ridiculous.&nbsp; Mark Zuckerberg did not invent social networking.&nbsp; His achievement at Harvard wasn't even that remarkable: 400 unique visitors to a just-launched website is great, but hardly unprecedented.&nbsp; Nor are his technological achievements all that impressive: assuming the movie's depiction to be accurate -- and I suspect it basically is, judging by the tasks he was performing -- he seems like a strong web developer, but not any kind of wunderkind (Facebook's ability to operate at its current scale using a hugely rewritten version of PHP is a genuinely impressive achievement, but the entry-level LAMP stuff Zuckerberg himself did is simple enough).</p>
<p>What Facebook did was deploy an extremely effective marketing scheme -- one based on exclusivity -- at exactly the right&nbsp; moment.&nbsp; From there, network effects took over and delivered success.&nbsp; This is an impressive commercial achievement, but it is not a triumph of vision or technical skill.&nbsp; <a class="reference external" href="http://www.danah.org/papers/talks/PDF2009.html">Depending on your perspective, you might not even consider it to be particularly admirable</a>.</p>
<p>In the absence of Zuckerberg, <a class="reference external" href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/ezra-klein/2010/10/zuckerberg_zuckerberg_zuckerbe.html">someone else would have almost certainly come along and stolen Myspace's thunder</a> -- just as someone or something will surely supplant Facebook before its <a class="reference external" href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/2585-facebook-is-not-worth-33000000000">ludicrous valuation</a> is realized.&nbsp; Zuckerberg is not one of history's great men -- he's just one of its richest.</p>

                    <p>Alex Payne <a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/al3x/status/25614922261">points</a> to a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.links.org/?p=998&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+links%2FZvUZ+%28Ben+Laurie+Blathering%29">blog post by Ben Laurie</a> that discusses Diaspora and Haystack, and how projects like these can attract huge amounts of press, only to flame out as their charismatic founders' incompetence is revealed.</p>
<p>I agree with Ben's post, but it's worth being a bit more explicit about what allows these situations to arise: the quality of most tech journalism is abysmal. I mean really inexcusably bad. Mainstream publications regularly assign writers to cover the software industry that have a level of understanding regarding the field that would be unacceptable in an intern. The most esteemed practitioners in the tech press are either focused on the consumer electronic user experience or are building personal brands around faith-based tech triumphalist movements.</p>
<p>In this sort of environment, it should be no surprise that an embarrassing hype cycle can emerge -- one that talented self-promoters will use to enhance their status and wealth. I find it difficult to assign all that much blame to those self-promoters: the whole problem is that <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect">they don't know any better</a>. What more can we expect? Besides, it's very easy to start believing your own bullshit once people with seemingly-meaningful professional credentials start validating it. Self-promoters will self promote; it's not realistic to expect them to be the ones providing diligence.</p>
<p>I suspect that the problem may have to do with the structure of the industry: if you know much about it, you're probably going to be able to make more money participating in it than writing about it. I don't know enough about finance to really judge, but it seems as though that press sector suffers from a similar systemic disability -- certainly all can agree that the financial press didn't cover itself in glory in advance of the recent financial crisis. Once that story became big enough, talented generalist journalists filtered in and did the job properly.</p>
<p>But unless and until the skill premium for the software industry diminishes relative to journalism I'm not sure there's a good way to align incentives in a way that fixes this problem. The best we can do is to recognize that the journalists who wrote excitedly about Haystack and Diaspora made a mistake; they were fooled, and they wasted our time. There's no need to tar and feather anyone, but their credibility needs to suffer if we want this situation to improve.</p>
<p>Maybe we don't need it to improve! It's not that important, to be perfectly honest. But it sure does bug the hell out of me.</p>

                    <p>I'm taking some grim satisfaction in the dissolution of the Haystack Project. If people have actually been hurt by this software, I'll be removing the &quot;satisfaction&quot; part of that reaction.&nbsp; But given the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2010/06/07/the_twitter_revolution_that_wasnt">relentless overhyping</a> of technological interventions in pro-democratic organizing, I'm hopeful that little actual damage has been done.&nbsp; These technologies will no doubt soon become genuinely crucial to people living under repressive governments, but I'm optimistic that Heap's work didn't spread far enough to cause serious trouble.</p>
<p>A few key links:</p>
<ul class="simple">

<li><a class="reference external" href="http://techpresident.com/blog-entry/whos-fault-hyping-haystack">Nancy Scola discusses the media's inability to report responsibly on technology</a> (and is very nice to me, though I hasten to say that I'm no security expert)</li>
<li>The twitter stream of &#64;ioerror, beginning at <a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/ioerror/status/24425326976">this tweet</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I think Nancy's piece raises the most important questions: why did the media -- and more importantly, the federal government -- fall for Austin Heap's bullshit?&nbsp; Here I disagree with Nancy: I don't think it's just a question of technical expertise.&nbsp; I've been <a class="reference external" href="/2010/06/10/checking-in-on-twitter-and-iran/">skeptical</a> of <a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/sbma44/statuses/20716325414">Haystack</a> since its announcement, but I couldn't write a secure crypto proxy to save my life.&nbsp; That stuff is really hard.</p>
<p>But here's the thing: the technology is hard, but it's also <em>done</em>.&nbsp; Smart people have looked at these problems and have solved the ones that are solvable.&nbsp; There's work left to be done at the edges -- better hash algorithms, that kind of thing -- but I guarantee that's not the sort of flaw that's afflicting Haystack.</p>
<p>The thing to realize is that good security is a set of patterns.&nbsp; Relatively few of them have to do with technology (although learning about the technology behind security systems can certainly help you understand the patterns).&nbsp; The media's naivete springs from the idea that the right app could liberalize Iran.&nbsp; Ignorance of the app's internals is a much smaller problem than the sort of wishful thinking that gets that story pitched and approved (and read).&nbsp; Recognizing a snake oil salesman is just as important as recognizing an exploit.</p>
<p>Alarms should have gone off when Heap announced he was writing new software.&nbsp; Why write software?&nbsp; We have software.&nbsp; Did Heap think the limitations of Tor and Freenet and Freegate and PGP and all the others exist because those tools' authors are lazy or stupid?&nbsp; That was never the problem.</p>
<p>I guess what I'm trying to say is that reporters should spend more time reading <a class="reference external" href="http://www.schneier.com/">Bruce Schneier</a>.&nbsp; Even the repetitive entries. <em>Especially</em> the repetitive entries.</p>

                    <p>I'm not in much of a blogging mood, but I wanted to get this down now, with a timestamp, so I can say &quot;I told you so&quot; in 9 months: <em>app</em> is going to become a dirty word.</p>
<p>At work I've been fielding a number of calls from tech companies who would like us to develop a version of one of our offerings customized to their upcoming platform -- whether mobile, or web-based, or (most ridiculously) centered around a particularly power-efficient x86 processor.&nbsp; This enthusiasm is a testament to the quality of the work my colleagues do and to the excitement currently surrounding the open gov space.&nbsp; Both of those are wonderful things!&nbsp; And to be clear, I intend to take advantage of some of these opportunities.&nbsp; There is publicity to be had. In some cases I think that saying &quot;yes&quot; is the rational, self-interested thing to do.</p>
<p>But only insofar as it allows us to take advantage of an essentially irrational trend.&nbsp; It is increasingly clear to me that, in the fall and winter, exclusive&quot; app stores will begin proliferating at a pace that is unjustifiable, and which will likely lead, appropriately, to the concept of &quot;apps&quot; and &quot;app stores&quot; being denigrated and then stigmatized.</p>
<p>Companies have looked at the runaway success of Apple's mobile application distribution model and found themselves slavering.&nbsp; Nevermind that the mobile space, and Apple, and their first-mover advantage are all unique.&nbsp; These copycats are going to try to recreate that success.&nbsp; Everyone can have their own walled garden!&nbsp; Every platform will be exclusive and revolutionary!&nbsp; An no, of course we're not trying to lock anybody in to anything. Why would you even think such a thing?</p>
<p>It's heinous, it's stupid, and it's contrary to the norms that have made the internet as great and powerful as it is.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>To get philosophical for a moment, all this is an iteration of one of a handful of archetypal technology debates -- in this case, <em>open versus closed</em>.&nbsp; The thing is, this is a very boring debate: we know that the answer is &quot;almost always open&quot;, and we've known it for a while.&nbsp; I'd much prefer to go back to <em>fat client versus thin client</em> (aka &quot;the cloud will change everything forever and I have the powerpoint to prove it&quot;).&nbsp; That debate is at least deservedly cyclical, driven by the ebb and flow of processing power, storage, technology's social ubiquity and, more recently, battery life and wireless bandwidth.&nbsp; We'll probably arrive at an answer there, too, but not before we get a bit closer to the fundamental physical limits constraining our technologies and/or nervous systems.</p>

                    <p>So!&nbsp; At work we've been spending a couple of days working on off-the-wall projects -- it's a change of pace, a chance to work with folks not on our usual teams, an opportunity to try out new ideas, and a venue for some friendly competition.</p>
<p>One of the projects that my team considered but ultimately discarded was some sentiment analysis on on press statements made by legislators about the BP oil spill.&nbsp; I figured we could pull some press releases, scan them for their level of aggression (or whatever) and compare the results to the level of oil industry support enjoyed by that legislator (thanks, <a class="reference external" href="http://transparencydata.com/">Transparency Data</a>!).&nbsp; The result probably wouldn't have set the world aflame, but if it turned out the way I expected it might've made for a fun and topical visualization.</p>
<p>As I said, we didn't end up pursuing that idea.&nbsp; But I did get far enough in researching sentiment analysis to realize that I'd like to use the ANEW dataset -- a spatial model of various emotionally-charged words that would help me classify arbitrary texts.&nbsp; Now, Emily says that she thinks sentiment analysis is &quot;kind of bullshit&quot;, and I'm not sure I disagree.&nbsp; But I think it might still be interesting to run the numbers and see what comes up.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the folks who created ANEW <a class="reference external" href="http://csea.phhp.ufl.edu/media/anewmessage.html">don't want to give their data away</a>.&nbsp; Well, that's not quite right: they'll give it away, for free, if you're a researcher.&nbsp; A researcher who has a .edu email address.&nbsp; And who isn't a student.</p>
<p>This seems a little silly to me.&nbsp; And it seems <em>really</em> silly when you consider that their <a class="reference external" href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Affective%20norms%20for%20English%20words%20%28ANEW%29%3A%20Instruction%20manual%20and%20affective%20ratings&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;sa=N&amp;hl=en&amp;tab=ws">widely-available 1999 paper introducing ANEW</a> contains a complete data set.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="/2007/10/16/hypem-revivified-then-vivisected/">You can probably see where this is going</a>.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="/static/2010/06/anew-1999.tar.gz">Here's the data in CSV format</a>.&nbsp; <a class="reference external" href="http://github.com/sbma44/begin_anew">Here's the code used to generate it</a>. <a class="reference external" href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/757723154j4w726k/fulltext.html">Here's a paper that shows how to use ANEW</a>.</p>
<p>Given the age of the paper its widespread availability, I can't imagine there'll be any objections to transforming its contents slightly into a more useful format. If there are, I'd be happy to hear them in comments -- and if any are made by the folks responsible for ANEW, I'll be happy to remove the link to everything here that contains even a whiff of their copyright.</p>
<p>And of course this is pretty old data.&nbsp; I'm sure that ANEW's gotten better in the last decade (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.sci.sdsu.edu/CAL/wordlist/">this page</a>, for example, refers to ANEW as containing 2000 words; my copy has just over a thousand).&nbsp; But it's something to start with.&nbsp; It'd be great if its creators decided to remove some of the hoops surrounding their list -- there are lots of research efforts that exist outside of the .edu TLD.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>Way back when, I wrote a <a class="reference external" href="http://dcist.com/map/">Google Maps application</a> for <a class="reference external" href="http://www.dcist.com">DCist</a> that overlaid the DC Metro system on the usual GMaps tiles. People found it useful -- me especially, since I think it helped me land a job at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.echoditto.com">EchoDitto</a>.&nbsp; Its only real innovation was some simple, hacked-up geometry that would horrify a cartographer, but which allowed me to make an attractive map that recalled <a class="reference external" href="http://wmata.com/rail/maps/map.cfm">the more stylized WMATA map</a>.&nbsp; It wasn't rocket science, but I still occasionally get emails from developers asking me how I did it (which is slightly bizarre, given that the code is right there for them to see).</p>
<p>In 2007 the GMaps API got an update, and <a class="reference external" href="http://dcist.com/2007/07/13/dcist_maps_come.php">I converted the project into something called a mapplet</a>. I had to rewrite a few things, but it was more or less the same.&nbsp; The main difference was that mapplets were used through the maps.google.com interface -- you could add a bunch at the same time, but you could still use Local Search and permalinking and comments about businesses and other Googly innovations from within the interface.&nbsp; I didn't have to implement any of that stuff!&nbsp; Instead, users could simply have their polished Google Maps experience supplemented by my modest mapplet.&nbsp; Handy.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, over the last few weeks I've started receiving reports that the mapplet's behaving weirdly.&nbsp; Load the mapplet, then do a search for something -- the station markers will disappear, and sometimes some of the lines that are supposed to connect them will, too.&nbsp; It looked to me like an event handler had started working differently, so I went to investigate.</p>
<p>Alas!&nbsp; It turns out that v2 of the API has been deprecated.&nbsp; They're on to v3 (not so bad) and they've discontinued the mapplet platform entirely (bad)!</p>
<p>I can still make the lines appear on a Google Map.&nbsp; But I don't think I can do it on the maps.google.com interface.&nbsp; This is a drag: I don't think the thing's half as useful as a standalone product as it is when it supplements search functionality.&nbsp; And I really don't want to reimplement the entire maps.google.com interface (even though, yes, they expose the API for their local search stuff).</p>
<p>So! Developers! Anyone out there dealt with this? I'm not eager to dump a huge amount of time back into this project -- a project that's increasingly unnecessary thanks to Google Transit and the addition of transit stations to the GMaps tileset, but which is still useful when you're working at a modestly wide zoom level.&nbsp; But it would be nice to get things working again.</p>

                    <p>Alright, a quick poll for those of you who love this album: what have you been listening to it on?&nbsp; The last time I really checked these guys out was when they were being tweeted about endlessly during SXSW.&nbsp; I headed to the Hype Machine and listened to what had been released or leaked.</p>
<p>It was physically unpleasant. I mean, not painful, exactly. That would be going too far.&nbsp; But my old man ears really, <em>really</em> recoiled from it.</p>
<p>But that was all on headphones (sealed-back headphones at that). Today I'm giving the album a chance over speakers, and I have no complaints.&nbsp; I actually like it!&nbsp; And am adding it to my still-extremely-tenuous &quot;2010 = summer of anthemic rock&quot; thesis (Fang Island being the other major data point).</p>
<p>Maybe I'm an outlier here.&nbsp; I still think the clipping is a gimmick, and one that really, really doesn't work without a room full of air to mellow it out.&nbsp; But I'm excited at the prospect of being less of a pain in the ass about this record.</p>
<p>(And yes, I realize that this post constitutes an inevitable but still detestable descent into explicit audiophile pain-in-the-assery.&nbsp; But if you know me you've known for a while that this was only a matter of time.)</p>

                    <p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0510/36789.html">This Politico story</a> finishes solidly, but man does it ever start off badly.&nbsp; I suppose I shouldn't expect anything different, but the newspapers' obsession with an imagined era of dispassionate objectivity is now less charmingly eccentric than it is indicative of a distressing disconnection from the fundamental nature of reality.&nbsp; Anyway, <a class="reference external" href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/ezra-klein/2010/05/a_theory_of_bloggers_and_the_m.html">Ezra's take</a> is both smarter and, hopefully, will allow those truth-and-justice-believin-in newspapermen a way to mentally sidestep the dreaded question of partisanship.</p>
<p>In other MSM-bashing news: man, I had a hard time writing the <a class="reference external" href="http://dcist.com/2010/05/morning_roundup_pretty_awful_editio.php">morning roundup</a> today.&nbsp; The latest details from the UVA lacrosse player murder were clearly one of the day's most prominent stories, and I found myself trying to thread the slim gap between condemning the coverage and failing to condemn the murderer.</p>
<p>To be clear: Huguely, having reportedly confessed to the crime, can't be considered anything other than a monster.&nbsp; But I can't help but recoil at the way the Post's editors handled this story.&nbsp; I mean, take a look at <a class="reference external" href="/static/2010/05/05/cartoonish-20100505-130108.png">this</a>.&nbsp; It's cartoonish.&nbsp; If you <a class="reference external" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/05/04/AR2010050402215.html?sid=ST2010050304618">read the story</a> it's clear that the reporters were unable to turn up any really damning quotes about Huguely from anyone who actually knew him or his victim.&nbsp; So instead they hang their case for his obvious villainy on a drunken run-in with the cops where he seems to have mouthed off, then engaged in some violent behavior before or in the course of getting tasered.&nbsp; That's not the mark of a model citizen by any measure, but it's also not an outrageously unusual thing to find on a fraternity member and varsity athlete's resume.</p>
<p>The story goes to even more ridiculous lengths, actually underscoring <em>in the text</em> the disparity between the victim's lovely class photo and Huguely's bedraggled mug shot.</p>
<p>I'm not at all anxious to rehabilitate the image of a murderer.&nbsp; But I do think the Post is doing everyone a disservice by playing up this guy as some sort of transparent villain, skulking through the UVA campus until his dark and brutal nature finally, inevitably, claimed a victim.&nbsp; That sort of laughable oversimplification doesn't help anyone except those who enjoy clucking their tongues and patting themselves on the back -- as if they don't know anyone who could ever perpetrate or fall victim to domestic abuse.</p>
<p>Far more useful would&nbsp; have been an effort to tell the story that seems to be implied by the scant quotes people who actually knew the couple: that all too often people fail to anticipate these tragedies before they occur. Unfortunately, even monstrous human beings rarely appear to be the sort of villainous caricatures that sell newspapers.&nbsp; It's worth taking that idea seriously more seriously than the Post did.</p>

                    <p>Yesterday <a class="reference external" href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2010/04/queueing">Ryan posted</a> about the dread he feels at the prospect of one day having to take his daughter to an amusement park.</p>
<blockquote>
Specifically, I'm dreading the queues. Endless, winding queues, lasting hours, all to ride a roller coaster for two minutes.</blockquote>
<p>He proposes the creation of a market for individual rides -- whether through actual pricing or some sort of scrip -- which would help shorten lines and, hopefully, do a better job of letting customers use the attractions they value most.</p>
<p>I don't like this idea! I am a roller coaster enthusiast -- though each visit to a theme park makes it clearer that adult bodies are physiologically unsuited for such entertainments -- and I would hate to have to participate in a market for rides. I'm sure it would lead to more efficient outcomes in a narrow sense. But the increasing body of literature around the power of &quot;free&quot; as a price point indicates why this would still be a drag: freedom from calculation, judgment and decision-making has utility all its own. This would be no kind of way to run a society, but for entertainment it often makes a lot of sense to excuse people from the burden of weighing pros and cons. Folks really like all-you-can-eat buffets, even if they have to pay a little more. Besides, nobody wants to take their kid to the park and be asked why the rich families don't have to wait in line.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I think technology can save us (surprise!). Disney's got something called <a class="reference external" href="http://disneyworld.disney.go.com/guest-services/fast-pass/">FASTPASS</a> that lets park visitors claim an electronic reservation for a ride, then wander around the park until the appointed time. Limits on the each customers' number of simultaneously-held reservations are enforced to prevent opportunistic oversubscription, and dynamic displays showing the expected wait times help regulate demand across the park's attractions. You spend much less time in line listening to the loud, looping and probably-broken pre-ride video presentation, and the park has successfully put you back into the market for games, concessions and other add-ons. Everyone wins! Plus, with the ubiquity of mobile phones, the up-front cost to implementing such a system is driven way, way down -- all you need to do is hand out some ziploc bags to make the system log flume-compatible.</p>
<p>So there. I think these systems will proliferate, solve Ryan's worry, AND still provide enough interesting data for an econ paper or two. I think everyone can get excited about that.</p>
