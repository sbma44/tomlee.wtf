                    <p>I just spent some time banging my head against this problem; let me save people wandering in from Google similar trouble.</p>
<p>So: you're trying to use pySerial to speak to your Arduino. It's not working. Or sometimes it is, but only when you have the Arduino Serial Monitor window open! This makes no sense.</p>
<p>Here's the deal: the Arduino's fancy &quot;you can flash new programs onto me without pressing my reset button!&quot; functionality works by resetting the damn thing whenever a new serial connection is made. With the serial monitor open, the connection's already open, so no reset happens and your script might actually work. When the monitor is closed, the Arduino resets when Python connects to it -- and the Arduino might still be busy booting up when your script begins shoving bits across the link.</p>
<p>So! You can disable this auto-reset behavior (you'll have to ask the Arduino people about that), but it seems simplest to just make your python script long-running and wait patiently for a beat or two after opening the serial link. Here's a dead-simple example:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">[cc lang=&quot;python&quot;]import serial, sys</div>
<div class="line">from time import sleep</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">SERIAL_PORT = '/dev/tty.usbmodem621'</div>
<div class="line">SERIAL_RATE = 9600</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">ser = serial.Serial(SERIAL_PORT, SERIAL_RATE)</div>
<div class="line">sleep(2)</div>
<div class="line">val = int(sys.argv[1])</div>
<div class="line">ser.write(chr(val))[/cc]</div>
</div>
<p>Here's the Arduino sketch. It just blinks the LED on pin 13 however many times you sent as a byte (I'm working on sending binary-ish data over the serial link; hence the use of raw byte values):</p>
<p>[cc lang=&quot;java&quot;]byte inByte = 0;</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">void setup()</div>
<div class="line">{</div>
<div class="line">Serial.begin(9600);</div>
<div class="line">pinMode(13, OUTPUT);</div>
<div class="line">}</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">void loop()</div>
<div class="line">{</div>
<div class="line">if (Serial.available() &gt; 0) {</div>
<div class="line">inByte = Serial.read();</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">for(int i=0;i digitalWrite(13, HIGH);</div>
<div class="line">delay(500);</div>
<div class="line">digitalWrite(13, LOW);</div>
<div class="line">delay(500);</div>
<div class="line">}</div>
<div class="line">}</div>
<div class="line">}</div>
<div class="line">[/cc]</div>
</div>
<p>There! That was irritating.</p>

<p>But of course this is nonsense. &nbsp;To a first approximation every American can afford to use the telephone and the post office. And in urban and suburban areas, at least, libraries make computers widely available. &nbsp;What marginalized people lack is time, attention and education. &nbsp;Maybe they don't have a cellular data plan either, but first things first. &nbsp;Besides, to the extent that technology access <em>is</em>&nbsp;a real problem,&nbsp;falling electronics prices are likely to do much more to address the issue than even the most conscientiously designed interfaces (on this score, the news on smartphone penetration is <a class="reference external" href="http://blog.nielsen.com/nielsenwire/online_mobile/generation-app-62-of-mobile-users-25-34-own-smartphones/">very encouraging</a>).</p>
<p>Still, just because projects that concentrate on technological deficits are focusing on a small and relatively unimportant part of a dauntingly large problem doesn't mean that such efforts aren't laudable. &nbsp;There's always room for making a difference at the margin. &nbsp;And there's something to be said for principle. &nbsp;Designing our work to be inclusive and truly democratic is important -- sometimes more important than maintaining a depressingly realistic appraisal of our chances for coding our way to egalitarianism.</p>
<p>(I should probably add that I think creating accessible interfaces for politically engaged populations that have difficulty using technology -- the disabled, seniors, etc -- is a very different endeavor from the broader/gloomier digital divide issue)</p>

                    <p>Matt and I have gone <a class="reference external" href="/2011/09/20/no-seriously-cable-tv-is-terrible/">back and forth</a> about this before, and I'd be lying if I said I felt completely confident in my response to the licenses-for-parks metaphor. &nbsp;But I do feel confident that <a class="reference external" href="http://thinkprogress.org/yglesias/2011/11/17/370919/the-a-la-carte-mirage/">he's wrong about this</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
[...] Once the cable company has built the infrastructure to deliver cable to your house and given you the box, it doesn’t cost them any more money to give you 100 channels rather than 10. To be sure, building infrastructure&nbsp;<em>capable of delivering more channels</em>&nbsp;costs more money. But once the infrastructure’s built, it can deliver what it can deliver and there are no incremental savings to achieve by not using all the capacity. I think it’s completely true that cable television has become a questionable value proposition—it’s extremely expensive and though the infrastructure to deliver hundreds of channels to the home is impressive, it’s not actually useful since nobody watches that many channels. What we actually need is faster broadband internet. But the infrastructure’s already built. Refusing to use it doesn’t reduce the suppliers’ costs and wouldn’t save customers any money.</blockquote>
<p>Two things. First, the cable company buys its content from various aggregators and producers of video product. I'm sure that the terms of these purchases vary considerably, and to some degree must be tied to consumer demand for that content. But there is marginal cost to adding a new channel even if there isn't marginal cost to distributing it. There's necessarily cross-subsidization going on, which means some viewers are getting a raw deal. Probably most of them, I'd argue: given the lack of choice in the market, there are strong incentives for the cable company to add new channels in order to widen their customer base; they can simply add the new features to their existing customers' tabs. iTunes, Amazon and Netflix can be understood to be competing with cable and satellite largely on the basis of offering a non-venti option to consumers (to borrow Matt's analogy) and they're having a lot of success with it because many people rightly intuit that they're not consuming $100 worth of video product every month.</p>
<p>Second, nearly all cable systems are now or soon will be digital, which means they're packet-switched, which means that, to varying degrees, broadband capacity and video capacity are fungible. The actual details are, I'm sure, quite convoluted and complex, and we're not going to be able to hash them out here without help from someone who understands the relative merits of different versions of DOCSIS. But it's safe to say that there is one copper conductor entering your house that handles both internet and TV, and that the portion allocated to each can be changed through configuration choices made by your cable vendor.</p>

<p>Somehow Charles talked me into doing the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.primalmudrun.com/race/primal-mid-atlantic/">Primal Mud Run</a> on Saturday. It's true that I've been adopting more of his crazed fitness strategies over the last year, but this was still an entirely new thing for me. &nbsp;I'm not a very good runner, and making my 5k debut with an event that also involved mud and obstacles was daunting. &nbsp;Today I'm sore and my lungs seem to still be reconfiguring themselves to a level of functional ambition they had never before considered. But I'm glad I did it.</p>
<p>One part was particularly interesting. The most unpleasant obstacle involved wading into a very cold pond and swimming under some barrels. &nbsp;You know how when you hit your thumb with a hammer or burn your hand on the stove, and say &quot;Ow!&quot;, there's some sense of volition tied to the exclamation? I mean, it's not a deliberate act, exactly, saying &quot;ow&quot;. &nbsp;But you could suppress it if you wanted to.</p>
<p>Well, each time I came up from under those barrels I was surprised to hear myself emit a sort of pathetic howl/whimper, not dissimilar to the ones tough-minded Jack Bauer might have drawn from a sinister interrogation subject. &nbsp;It was just completely automatic and beyond my control. It's always interesting and horrifying when you discover some new thing your body does without asking your permission. I&nbsp;trudged through the rest of the event in a kind of animal stupor, and when I was done Charles had to show me where I'd left my jacket.</p>
<p>But this was all pathetic and ludicrous. A hundred yards away, trucks were selling beer and barbecue sandwiches. Other participants were running in halloween costumes, tutus and thrift-store suit jackets.</p>
<p>All of which just goes to show that I would have made a terrible Marine. And the next time you hear me speculating about strategies for surviving the collapse of civilization, you should probably roll your eyes even harder than you normally would've.</p>

<p>As is probably obvious, I think there are good reasons to be excited about information technology's capacity to improve governance. For the small stuff, it already has -- I can get a new recycling bin delivered just by visiting a website!</p>
<p>But for the really big stuff -- like keeping track of how we award multi-million dollar contracts, or how we regulate polluters, or how we track the political influence economy -- there are significant barriers to applying automated analysis. A lack of usable corporate identifiers is among the biggest of these problems. Citizens are expected to have trackable identifiers for their cars, and firearms, and selves. I have to surrender my SSN to a private entity just to see if I'm allowed to buy a new phone!</p>
<p>But for companies, the situation is quite different. Corporate registrations are held by states, which face bad incentives around making this data usable both because inaccessible registration information makes the state more attractive to registrants, and because states collect substantial sums for use of the data. Meanwhile, the federal government is wrapped in a nightmare tangle of purpose-built ID fiefdoms and one overarching public-private partnership that supplies identifier data that's both unacceptably restricted and of unacceptably poor quality.</p>
<p>Attempts to improve the situation will no doubt be met with much gnashing of virtual teeth: competitiveness! Privacy! Personhood! None of these hold much water, though: not only has relevant tax return information (which would go a long way toward solving this problem) been completely public at various times in our nation's history, but other countries impose a disclosure burden adequate to resolve the problem while still enjoying vibrant, competitive economies.</p>
<p>Anyway, my colleagues make this case more rigorously and persuasively both <a class="reference external" href="http://sunlightfoundation.com/sixdegrees/">at this microsite</a> and in <a class="reference external" href="http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2011/11/01/we-cant-have-corporate-accountability-until-we-have-corporate-identifiers/">this blog post</a> (about the overall problem) and <a class="reference external" href="http://sunlightlabs.com/blog/2011/physics-of-the-corporate-universe/">this one</a> (about the technical considerations behind our presentation). I hope you'll give it all a look.</p>

                    <p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/6289961509/"><img alt="our office sodastream" class="right" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6118/6289961509_d57ac2512a_m.jpg" style="width: 180px; height: 240px;" /></a>Over the past few years, many of you have heard me evangelize the gospel of home carbonation. At work we've recently taken things to a new level, and I've had a couple of people ask me questions about it. As you can imagine, I'm delighted to answer them. But let's begin at the beginning.</p>
<p>My interest is in making seltzer water -- growing up we called it &quot;bubbly water&quot;, and my dad bought it by the case. I'm not sure why I like it so much: the slightly acid tang of the carbonic acid in solution? The cooling, quenching sensation I feel as the dissolved gas pushes the water out of my stomach, into my intestine and on to my bloodstream? I'm not sure. But I really like it.</p>
<p>Until recently, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/iSi-2248-Siphon-Brushed-Aluminum/dp/B00007JXR7">soda siphons</a> were the only way to make seltzer at home. But the pricing doesn't work: the tiny CO2 cannisters that power the things, while handy -- my dad once told me that in his youth he used to stuff empties full of matchheads to create what must have been an awesomely dangerous projectile -- are so expensive that you're much better off lugging liter bottles home from the store.</p>
<p>My then-neighbor <a class="reference external" href="http://goodspeedupdate.com/">Rob Goodspeed</a> was the first person I knew to have a Soda Club. It was during the golden age of PR flacks sending bloggers things for no apparent reason, and Rob had cofounded DCist, earning him rights to substantial swag. Most of these pitches were laughably inept either because the product was awful or the pitch was tone-deaf (as a technology blogger, <em>of course</em> I was the right person to email about <a class="reference external" href="http://www.kernelseasons.com/">custom popcorn flavoring powders</a>). It didn't feel like much of an ethical conundrum -- it was all too stupid for that. But occasionally the flacks would succeed, and <a class="reference external" href="http://dcist.com/2005/11/carbonating_in.php">the original Soda Club was such a case</a>. Rob was justifiably enthusiastic about the product, and as soon as I saw it I decided to buy one for myself. I've gone on to buy units for friends and parents and siblings, and I've talked many more people into doing the same. It's a great product.</p>
<p>The company has since rebranded to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.sodastream.com/">SodaStream</a> (I like to think our Club is no longer accepting new members), and is even publicly traded (as <a class="reference external" href="http://finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=SODA+Interactive#chart2:symbol=soda;range=1y;compare=vti;indicator=volume;charttype=line;crosshair=on;ohlcvalues=0;logscale=on;source=undefined">$SODA</a>, of course). My original Soda Club carbonator is still going strong.</p>
<p>its operation is simple. You fill a bottle with a liter of cold water and screw it into the unit. You depress a button several times, until the overflow valve starts to make a horrible flatulent sound. The bottle leaves the machine with an infinitely satisfying <em>chffff</em> noise, like a tiny, refreshing alien disembarking from his pressurized spaceship. You're then free to add flavored syrups (carbonating anything other than pure water is a big no-no). SodaStream is happy to sell you those syrups, of course -- their Red Bull knockoff isn't bad, and avoiding giant flat bottles of tonic water is worth some flavor sacrifices. But the last time I checked (2005) many of the other flavors were underwhelming. Oh well: soda's bad for you anyway.</p>
<p>Even if you just want seltzer, you'll need SodaStream to sell you replacement CO2. This was their real innovation: the carbonator units contain replaceable cannisters of compressed gas that are much larger than those used by soda siphons. A refill costs $25 or $30 bucks (there are two sizes -- I strongly recommend the larger) and can either be delivered to your home or, as of late last year, picked up from most Bed Bath &amp; Beyond or Ace Hardware stores. I go through two or three of the larger cannisters per year.</p>
<p>As you might imagine, there's a bit of a markup on the gas. Quite a bit, in fact, though it's still a great deal compared to the alternatives that used to exist. Still...</p>
<p>I work with a number of fellow seltzer enthusiasts, and more than a few of them are also people who don't like the idea of business models based on lock-in. So once we had resolved to get a SodaStream for the office, it wasn't long until we came across <a class="reference external" href="http://co2doctor.com/">co2doctor.com</a>.</p>
<p>Compressed CO2 is easy to buy, as I found out in college when I built a kegerator. Any welding supply shop will be happy to sell you the stuff -- the good old boys in the Charlottesville shop asked if I was &quot;makin' some suds&quot; (I was). And like any good industrial byproduct, it's cheap: refilling one of tanks those guys use costs about the same amount as a SodaStream refill, but provides many times as much CO2.</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/6296475569/"><img alt="Siphon Tank" class="right" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6234/6296475569_ee3b718333_m.jpg" style="width: 167px; height: 240px;" /></a>SodaStream's gas cannisters -- they're properly referred to as &quot;bottles&quot; from here on out -- aren't designed to be refilled with standard equipment. There are booby-traps built into the valves. If you want to use bulk CO2, you need to avoid those valves. You've got two options for doing so:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>You can connect a CO2 cannister directly to your carbonator using the <a class="reference external" href="http://co2doctor.com/freedomoonespec.htm">FreedomOne</a>.</li>
<li>You can <a class="reference external" href="http://co2doctor.com/freedomvalvespec.htm">replace the valve</a> on a SodaStream bottle, then use the <a class="reference external" href="http://co2doctor.com/fillstationproIIspec.htm">FillStation</a> to refill it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Option 1 is appealing if you've got the space for it (SodaStream carbonators look good on a kitchen countertop; industrial CO2 cannisters do not). Our office chose the second option in order to make it possible for staff to refill CO2 cannisters for home use.</p>
<p>The option you select has implications for which CO2 tank you buy. If you're carbonating directly from the tank (option 1) you need a tank that dispenses gas. If you're refilling bottles, you need one that dispenses liquid CO2 -- a so-called siphon tank, which connects the tank valve to the bottom of the cylinder via a sort of metal straw. Either type can be acquired, full, for less than $100.</p>
<p>Replacing the valve was pretty easy. Discharge the bottle fully by pressing in the valve pin with a pen (do this outside; wear glasses or goggles). Find yourself a vice, or a couple of friends with excellent grip strength. You'll need a proper wrench, but once you have one the operation is easy: the valve simply unscrews. Replace it with the FreedomValve, using the supplied o-ring. Tighten it very securely.</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/6297007206/"><img alt="FillStation Pro" class="center" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6113/6297007206_921e97a47f.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: 375px;" /></a></p>
<p>Refilling the bottle is also easy. Once again: eye protection. Make sure all valves are closed. Connect to the tank; connect to the bottle. Open the FillStation's smaller valve to flush any pressure in the bottle. Close it. Open the large valve on the tank. Open the large valve on the FillStation. Listen for satisfying whooshing and gurgling. The good CO2 Doctor is very insistent that you fill your bottle by weight, and that you never overfill it -- but he also acknowledges that the laws of physics make it impossible to fill it to capacity using a mere siphon tank (as opposed to the exciting machinery that presumably exists at SodaStream World HQ). We weighed the bottle carefully and filled slowly, but we found that letting pressure completely equalize between the two worked just fine and left us within safety limits. Close the FillStation valve. Close the tank valve. Disconnect the bottle (there will be whooshing!). And for pete's sake remove the FillStation from the tank, lest it tip over, break off the valve and turn everything into an episode of MythBusters.</p>
<p>And that's it! At work <a class="reference external" href="http://boyinthebands.com/">Scott</a> has crunched the numbers and determined that refilling bottles for home use will entail a $4 per-bottle fee. That gets you about 80% of a full charge -- not bad! The $30 valve replacement will have paid for itself in just two bottles. But if you don't have a group that wants to share a siphon tank, you might be better off using the direct-to-tank adapter (for a breakdown of cost recovery using that method, see <a class="reference external" href="http://co2doctorfreedomoneplusreview.blogspot.com/">this post</a>). Or hell, just use SodaStream's bottle refill service like a sane person.</p>

<p>I won't bore everyone with an explanation of the character (I did quite enough of that last night) but if you like superhero comics and haven't read <em>Invincible</em>, you really should.

<p>I'm sorry the man is dead. I'm sorry when anyone dies. He accomplished a lot; he made my life better.</p>

And <a class="reference external" href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/4.02/jobs_pr.html">this one</a>. Jobs was a man who understood the problems facing our society. But he was also a man who canceled all corporate philanthropy at Apple upon taking control; who cited profitability concerns as the reason, but who didn't reinstate those programs even after creating the most valuable technology company in the world. He was, it seems to me, a man who wielded incredible power, but who chose to devote himself and that power exclusively to the creation of beautiful, perfect consumer objects. A man who seemed frightened of trying to address real problems directly.</p>
<p>I think he was absolutely nuts.</p>
<p>Bill Gates might be responsible for foisting a worse operating system upon the world, but you can't deny that he behaves like a conscientious human being.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>In the past I've been vaguely aware that the Booker Prize list was a good source of reading suggestions, and also that <a class="reference external" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2010/oct/07/booker-prize-betting-suspended-tom-mccarthy">people gamble on it</a>, which almost makes reading seem cool (obviously it's not, if any kids are reading this you should probably be off learning to smoke instead). But this year is the first time I've had an informed opinion about the books that are up for the prize. Well, the ones on the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.themanbookerprize.com/news/stories/1533">short list</a>, anyway: I'm not a particularly fast reader, but I happened to make lucky guesses when I decided to read some things from the long list. When the short list came out, getting through it seemed surprisingly achievable, thanks in part to all the shows I've been watching on Netflix settling into storylines that I found unwatchably depressing.</p>
<p>So hey! Let's blog about it, since that's something I'm trying to do more of:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Though it's not the quote-unquote best of these novels, I had the most fun reading <em>The Sisters Brothers</em> -- man, do I ever love westerns. Reluctant killers! Lonesome dignity! It's all great, and if you liked <em>Deadwood</em> or <em>Blood Meridian</em> or <em>Unforgiven</em> you'll probably like this book, too.</li>
<li>I think <em>Snowdrops</em> is being turned into a movie and I imagine it'll be a pretty decent one, like <em>The American</em> or <em>The Ghost Writer</em> or any of those Graham Greene or Le Carre adaptations that sort of make you remember how great the Jason Bourne movies but also allow you to pat yourself on the back for being so much more sophisticated than all that (which compensates for how much less bored you'd be if you were watching Matt Damon beat the hell out of some guy in a customs office). The book itself felt a little thin, but since a lot of my friends are Russophiles I won't hesitate to recommend it. This is one of the few on this list I own as a physical artifact, too, so if anyone's interested in borrowing it they should let me know.</li>
<li><em>The Sense of an Ending</em> is beautifully written, but meditative and depressing. This book has got a lot of contemplating-a-life-lived-and-going-&quot;meh&quot;. Maybe that's the kind of thing I'll want to read when I'm contemplating my life (lived). But I sort of hope not, and it certainly isn't the kind of thing I want to read today. Still, this is a undeniably masterful novella and if it wins I wouldn't be surprised (having just checked the odds after writing the non-parenthetical part of this sentence, it seems no one else would be surprised, either).</li>
<li><em>Jamrach's Menagerie</em> is the worst of the lot. It's pretentious and melodramatic and hasn't got much of a plan or a point. It did make me tear up at one point, but that's because I'm a sentimental idiot. Also: it's about a doomed sea voyage, not a menagerie, and only barely includes a guy named Jamrach. The author seems to think that <em>Moby Dick</em> was great, and you know what, she's right. Read that instead. (Also: yes, yes, the <em>actual</em> titular menagerie is the motley collection of characters, or whatever. Bah.)</li>
<li><em>Half-Blood Blues</em> is very good, but the narrative voice was a little hard to take. The protagonist is supposed to be a world-weary Baltimore jazzman, and his conversational, dialect-filled means of speaking is how the story is related to the reader. But it's a little strange to be constantly dropping pluralization and contractions, only to turn around and describe a waking bandmate's eyelids as &quot;fluttering like moths.&quot; Do jazzmen speak this way? Maybe I'm being unfair to jazzmen, but I doubt it. For the record, I am completely on board with the idea that someone can speak in vernacular while still having a rich inner life. For instance: I sometimes say &quot;y'all&quot;, yet I still care deeply about composing rambling, grandiloquent humblebraggy blog posts about the novels I've read! But I feel like some separation needs to be maintained. Edugyan's decision to allow vernacular into the narrator's sometimes-ornate inner monologue didn't ring true. On the other hand, this is a lovely book about jealousy and rivalry and friendship, and the action is set against the fascinating backdrop of the jazz scene of Berlin and Paris at the start of WWII. It's a well-executed, graceful book, and if you aren't bugged by the narration you'll probably really like it.</li>
<li>Speaking of narrative voice: I am kind of shocked that <em>Pigeon English</em> is <a class="reference external" href="http://www.themanbookerprize.com/news/stories/1537">not the favorite to win</a>. The book's success <a class="reference external" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/bookreviews/8362385/Pigeon-English-by-Stephen-Kelman-review.html">is an inspiring true story, and its content is a tragic true one</a>, for one thing. It's also just kind of amazingly good. The story is presented in the voice of its ten year-old protagonist, and the feat is pulled off perfectly. I have serendipitously gotten to know a kid that age over the last year; if I hadn't, I'm not sure I would've believed how crazy and simple and wonderful <em>PE</em> makes their minds out to be. But that's what they're like! It's probably torture to be around one for more than a couple of hours, but spending a few hundred pages in one's head is a surprisingly rewarding experience. I think this is the only book of the six that's going to stick with me, and I hope it wins.</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyway, as you can see I'm toying with the idea of having opinions about novels instead of opinions about music, as I'm now super-old and <a class="reference external" href="/2010/05/14/sleigh-bells/">it's all just noise anyway</a> (young people! so awful, right?). If you feel like joining me in this endeavor you should consider signing up for <a class="reference external" href="http://goodreads.com/">Goodreads</a>, which is kind of a terrible site but seems like a useful way to subject yourself to social pressure to read more and better books. Kay alone has probably shamed me into reading an extra thousand pages this year.</p>

                    <p>While I'm posting an inexplicable amount, let me just say that I appreciate <a class="reference external" href="http://thinkprogress.org/yglesias/2011/09/29/330940/if-you-want-politicians-to-spend-less-time-fundraising-give-them-free-money/">Matt's response</a> to <a class="reference external" href="/2011/09/28/its-not-crazy-to-think-that-money-in-politics-is-a-problem/">my post</a> about Dylan Ratigan's proposed ban on money in elections. In principle I agree that public financing could help with this problem. In practice, I think it's very, very rare that campaigns feel they spend beyond the point of diminishing returns (you do <em>occasionally</em> hear this about particular states or markets, so it's possible, just rare). That means that raising outside money will still be perceived as an advantage, which means politicians will keep doing it. Public funds might just inflate the prices of things that campaigns buy.</p>
<p>But hey, maybe not. I suppose the elasticity of fundraising behavior is the real question here (it might even be one that could be <a class="reference external" href="http://politicalpartytime.org/">empirically tested</a>). Perhaps easier money would help, but I think there are reasons -- mostly having to do with the culture of Capitol Hill -- for doubting it.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>I had a little bit of back and forth with Tim on Twitter about Solyndra and loan guarantees. When I first came to Sunlight I worked on <a class="reference external" href="http://subsidyscope.org">Subsidyscope</a>, and while I wouldn't want to claim deep expertise on the subject, it's certainly the case that I used the phrase &quot;loan guarantee&quot; several thousand times more frequently than the average pre-Solyndra American. I have no interest in defending Solyndra or the specific decision to subsidize their work, but I think at least <em>some</em> of the interest in this issue is driven by genuine confusion about this subsidy type and not cynical partisan scandal-seeking.</p>
<p>Subsidyscope has a <a class="reference external" href="http://subsidyscope.org/loans/#loanguarantees">great explanation</a> of how loan guarantees work; you should have a look at it. But wouldn't it be wonderful if there was a metaphorical version available that was full of folksy nonsense? I thought so, too.</p>
<p>So let's say the government needs some dynamite. Maybe Capitol Hill has some stumps to clear; maybe the Vice President is going fishing. Whatever the reason, there's a problem: the market isn't supplying enough dynamite for what they have in mind. In fact, a 22 year-old intern at GAO has recently estimated that we will need the output of fully three more dynamite factories to reach the necessary supply level (though he is also quick to point out that all of his input data is of terrible quality; that dynamite experts express varying opinions; that more research is necessary; and, of course, that Challenges Remain. His report does have a rather nice introduction about the history of governmental involvement in the explosives industry, though).</p>
<p>Fine, maybe we ought to build some dynamite factories. Not so fast! Each factory costs $1 million, which also happens to be the entire amount available at current GSA fishing trip reimbursement rates. That won't get the job done!</p>
<p>Luckily, the market can help us out. It turns out that there are businessmen interested in building dynamite factories. The problem, as any dynamite entrepreneur will tell you, is that any such a factory has a 25% chance of blowing up shortly after the ribbon-cutting ceremony. Unfortunately, the current state of the market makes this an unacceptable risk, what with all the regulatory uncertainty and undocumented workers and job-killing health care bills and whatnot. The businessmen wish they could help, but right now there's simply no way they can justify building those factories. If a factory exploded, its owners would be ruined.</p>
<p>&quot;Aha!&quot; says the government. &quot;I know what we can do! We'll just pick the four most promising dynamite factory proposals and tell their authors that if they go ahead with building, we'll promise to cover the cost of their investment if their factory explodes.&quot;</p>
<p>With this guarantee in hand, the businessmen proceed. They build four factories. One explodes. Whoops! Don't worry, no one was hurt and it looked pretty rad. Uncle Sam cuts a check and everyone's happy. The government has now spent a million dollars and gotten the three factories it needed. Nice! If they had tried to build a factory themselves, they could have only afforded one -- really, three-quarters of one, since it might have blown up (some say government-built dynamite factories are even more prone to this defect that those of the private sector).</p>
<p>So this is the idea: that the government can offer guarantees that tip unacceptably risky -- but not totally foolhardy! -- economic activity over into the realm of realization. The government is using its unique powers to shift risk instead of shifting resources directly. Sometimes shifting risk can allow money to flow through the economy in new and desirable ways. And it's often dramatically cheaper than spending funds directly to achieve the same result.</p>
<p>In some ways this is a very efficient way to spend subsidy dollars. In others, not so much: you're picking winners, you're shoving money into the finance system where some will be skimmed off, you're relying on risk estimates which sometimes just aren't that good. <a class="reference external" href="http://cfda.gov">CFDA.gov</a> lists 68 such programs right now; <a class="reference external" href="https://www.cfda.gov/index?s=program&amp;mode=form&amp;tab=step1&amp;id=068c899a15935e2d7198406c2852dca2">here's one that helps build ships and shipyards</a>. <a class="reference external" href="http://subsidyscope.org/transportation/risk-transfers/exim/">Here's one that subsidizes the purchase of Boeing aircraft</a> (note that in this case the default costs are balanced by gains from interest on successful transactions).</p>
<p>I haven't followed the Solyndra story very closely, but my understanding is that changing market conditions overtook their business very rapidly. The financing pipeline supporting them should have noticed this and shut down but didn't, either because of bureaucratic inertia or special favors or both. That's unfortunate. Luckily, the government's total exposure is likely to be much less than the $500 million face value that's being widely cited, and the final cost of the program that administered the loan guarantee is likely to be a small fraction of the face value of the lending it enabled.</p>
<p>All of this is a separate question from whether the government should be intervening in the economy in this manner. I think that's a conversation worth having. But it should be a conversation about programs, not transactions. To focus on one failed loan is a bit like pointing to a lottery winner and saying, &quot;<em>That's</em> how they think we're going to pay for our schools -- by handing out checks? What a bunch of dopes!&quot; But of course this ignores the bigger picture. Perhaps there is a problem with that lotto payout, but that's a different and frankly less important issue than whether it's wise for the government to run a lottery. This is why the intense focus on Solyndra strikes me and many others as a transparently partisan feeding frenzy rather than a considered discussion of energy policy.</p>

                    <p><em>Usual disclaimer: I'm not speaking for my employer.</em></p>
<p>Matt wrote <a class="reference external" href="http://thinkprogress.org/yglesias/2011/09/27/330310/what-problem-is-getting-money-out-of-politics-supposed-to-solve/">a post</a> keying off of Dylan Ratigan's proposal to outlaw money in politics. He doesn't see the point of it:</p>
<blockquote>
Like let’s say you’re Elizabeth Warren and you want to run a campaign against Scott Brown. How do you pay your campaign manager? How do you let people know that you’re running? To me, this doesn’t solve the problem that when Washington regulates the financial system, it’s dependent for expertise on people with ties to the financial industry. It doesn’t solve the problem of the revolving door. It doesn’t solve the problem that politicians need the “legislative subsidy” of lobbyists to do policy analysis. Nor does it solve the problem of monied interests exercising disproportionate influence over think tanks, advocacy groups, or even (through speaking fees and the like) journalists and pundits. Presumably the people who make the F-22 will still be allowed to advertise about how high levels of defense spending are awesome, just as ExxonMobile will still be allowed to advertise about how fossil fuel extraction is the road to prosperity. You’ll have created some big new logistical hassles for political campaigns without, I think, addressing any concrete issues.</blockquote>
<p>I don't watch Ratigan's show, so I don't know for sure, but I would be surprised if he was pitching this proposal as a way to end lobbying as a legislative subsidy, much less as a means to address the revolving door problem. And of course there won't ever be a silver bullet that makes money completely irrelevant to the political process.</p>
<p>But, contra Matt, I think it's easy enough to see Ratigan's motivation. In the absence of contributions, campaigns would have to deprofessionalize and rely to an even greater degree on motivated volunteers. An optimist would say that this might produce less homogenous candidates and campaigns, but you could easily make the case that it would just entrench the electoral power of crazy old people.</p>
<p>On the legislative subsidy front, well-funded lobbying campaigns would no doubt still yield results. But it's not crazy to think the situation would be improved if corporate lobbyists were competing for legislators' attention with public interest NGOs on a level playing field. Matt says that &quot;it’s too difficult for elected officials to get expert technical opinion on issues without relying on interested parties,&quot; but outside of the government itself I'd say that avoiding interested parties when seeking advice is pretty much a non-starter.</p>
<p>I think the most compelling argument for defunding elections is that it might select for a different class of politician. I've read estimates from retired congressmen that put the share of their time spent fundraising in the 30% range. That's insane. To endure the rigors of constantly begging wealthy supporters for large sums of money -- to say nothing of excelling at it -- must require a very strange set of skills. I suspect that those skills don't relate much to aptitude for governing. And I suspect that that time investment comes at the expense of other duties. I'm not naive enough to think we'd have a wave election that stuffed Capitol Hill with policy experts. But perhaps we'd get a few, along with some better orators, coalition-builders, horse-traders and glad-handers.</p>
<p>To be clear, it's obvious that Ratigan's proposal is mostly about making good TV (a nobler motivation than most proposals to amend the Constitution). And I don't want to pretend that it wouldn't carry substantial problems. Offhand, it seems very likely that, short of explicit restrictions on political speech, this policy would just formalize the de facto requirement that candidates be personally wealthy; celebrity candidates would be massively empowered by their name recognition; the press's political coverage pathologies would become all the more problematic as their role in conveying campaign messages increased in importance; turnout might drop, leaving an electorate that behaves more like primary voters, selecting for politicians with more extreme views; and the whole thing would be an enforcement nightmare.</p>
<p>Still. It's hard to escape the sense that federal politicians have become so professionalized -- so good at the game they play, so aware that the incentives they face have little to do with the quality of governance they deliver -- that we're all beginning to suffer for it. I'm not sure there's a solution to this problem short of a societal collapse and reboot, but it's easy to see why an optimist reach for a different answer.</p>

                    <p>Matt pointed me to <a class="reference external" href="http://groups.drupal.org/node/176914">this post</a>, by Matt Rognlie, as an argument against my <a class="reference external" href="/2011/09/19/a-rare-opportunity/">previous post</a>'s a la carte pricing dreams. &nbsp;I've seen this pro-bundling argument before, but I'm not swayed by it. Still, since I now have several people who are smarter than me about economics telling me I'm wrong, perhaps it's best to spell out my objections here rather than via sputtering, half-formed tweets.</p>
<p>Unbundling might be desirable even if it reduces efficiency in dollars per entertainment program available. It might be desirable even if it raises the price per entertainment program consumed! &nbsp;As you might've guessed, what follows will have more than a whiff of paternalism about it. I know that some people feel that so long as a dollar isn't spent on a drug raid, a war, or some other destructive purpose, the appropriateness of its use shouldn't be questioned. I'm at least a little bit sympathetic to that view. Still, I think the TV industry has understandably structured itself in a way that maximizes television consumption (in both dollars and time--but mostly dollars), reaching a level above what most consumers would prefer. I think the industry has been able to do so because of various limits on competition. Consequently I'll be glad to see its size reduced, even if by some measures the result is a worse deal.</p>
<p>It's obvious that we have too much television. &nbsp;This should be apparent even if you consider me a snob for thinking society would be improved if <a class="reference external" href="http://www.spike.com/shows/repo-games">Repo Games</a> were disappeared forever (and, ideally, its creators imprisoned). The still-recent advent of high-quality time-shifting/on-demand technology removes 24-hour programming as a requirement for television outlets; and allows content, free of time constraints, to be efficiently recycled to viewers who previously couldn't watch it. This should have allowed us to dramatically reduce the amount of television that's being produced and sold while keeping viewers' satisfaction constant. But of course that didn't happen[1].</p>
<p>Now to Rognlie's argument. While in broad terms the windfall of utility from infinite supply born of zero marginal cost seems like it should dwarf any fixed costs, in practice -- at the level of an individual subscriber -- it seems as though the utility we derive from additional television consumption and variety falls off quickly. Netflix streaming's success -- despite wide acknowledgement that its selection is poor -- speaks to an appetite for satisficing behavior in this area, doesn't it? Most people would agree that there is a lot of garbage on TV and that they are paying too much for it. I appreciate that Rognlie's argument anticipates this, but in practice it seems doubtful that everyone will have perfectly idiosyncratic views about what that garbage is in the way that his parks example supposes[2]. It seems like there are good reasons for thinking that we are investing more resources in television production than a real market dynamic would afford.</p>
<p>I don't like Rognlie's use of parks. I think it's an appeal to emotion, and that it ignores parks' function as a means of progressively redistributing resources and as a source of positive externalities. The metaphor that's more commonly applied to the cable industry -- correctly, I think -- is an all-you-can-eat buffet[3].</p>
<p>The buffet business model allows for a lot of variety in dishes, but at a low level of quality. &nbsp;Diners will be stuck cross-subsidizing one another in fairly arbitrary ways, and may face incentives to overconsume as they draw near the grim end of their personal utility functions. &nbsp;Decisions about how to allocate resources within the restaurant will be made in a way that's only vaguely connected to market signals; to the extent that those decisions reflect diners' preferences at all, they will probably be plagued by selection effects.</p>
<p>Buffets suck. They're a bad deal for almost everyone.</p>
<p>Right now the home TV industry gives consumers few non-buffet choices. I think that's likely to change, that it'll mean fewer total resources will be directed toward the industry, that consumer satisfaction with the programming they buy will increase, and that that will be a good thing.</p>
<p>[1] There's no reason that consumer satisfaction would <em>have</em> to remain constant, of course. But in a real market you'd expect consumers to be able to take the gains from this type of innovation either as consumption or by saving money while keeping consumption constant, right? The television vendors' market power means that this latter scenario is not an option; gains have to be taken as consumption. The falling share of per capita hours spent on TV suggests to me that consumers would prefer to allocate this windfall differently.</p>
<p>[2] And in practice it doesn't seem as though the proliferation of channels really has afforded the kind of utility-enhancing long-tail variety that a la carte opponents suppose. &nbsp;Not to get all Current TV on you (assuming Current TV still exists), but economic and cultural realities have led to each new channel &nbsp;just carving out tiny new &quot;lifestyle&quot; niches in the same suburban, straight, white, consumerist orientation. The model can't even support a music video channel, for pete's sake, or programming for huge market segments (women! black people! hispanics!) that isn't an insulting, low-budget joke.</p>
<p>[3] Food has a real marginal cost, of course, but the price of cranking out one more steam tray of crappy lo mein is minimal compared to the operation's fixed costs (which, for this argument, include the costs of adding each new menu item). And in most cases adding another menu item won't push a diner to consume more in absolute terms; it'll just improve the diner's lot by providing them with more variety, shifting how they allocate their choices prior to getting full.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>It's not often that I disagree with Tim Lee, so let me relish this. &nbsp;I think Netflix is being smart! &nbsp;Or at least not-that-unwise. <a class="reference external" href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/timothylee/2011/09/19/netflix-is-not-facing-the-innovators-dilemma/">Tim casts his argument</a> in terms of movie availability, and from that perspective he's probably right: the DVD-only Qwikster (or however you spell it) might have a bit less leverage in amassing movie libraries than the currently-unified Netflix (then again, it might not; as far as I know Netflix has only committed to splitting its brand and customer base; the two entities might still sit together at the bargaining table).</p>
<p>But I think this fails to recognize the ambition of Netflix's plans. They're not competing with Blockbuster, or Redbox, or jeez, who is even in the movie rental business anymore? &nbsp;They're now competing with DirecTV and Comcast, first by agreeing to sell consumers video content by the ounce instead of the unwieldy, one-size-fits-all sacks of the stuff that the cable companies insist upon. &nbsp;Second, I imagine they'll begin riding the&nbsp;inevitable logic of a la carte pricing to its conclusion, making more deals with both marquee and low-cost cable channels, allowing customers to add that pre-time-shifted content to their lineups for a couple of bucks a month. &nbsp;Netflix is also pursuing <a class="reference external" href="http://www.deadline.com/2011/03/netflix-to-enter-original-programming-with-mega-deal-for-david-fincher-kevin-spacey-drama-series-house-of-cards/">original programming</a>, establishing itself not only as a cheaper, higher-tech and more convenient disintermediating marketplace for television, but as an exclusive provider of certain high-esteem shows (imagine if they do manage to land an exclusive on one Mad Men-style success...).</p>
<p>To Netflix customers who mostly think of the service as a way to get movies, I can understand why today's move seems dumb. &nbsp;But as someone who mostly thinks of the service as a way to watch television shows, it makes perfect sense. &nbsp;And of course I'm delighted to see a business/tech innovation achieve what the cable/satellite market and federal regulation could not: a la carte programming and the consignment of cable network operators to a bulk-bandwidth-vending fate (I've been saying for a while that the natural monopoly implied by the physical realities of cable systems means that they ought to wind up as utilities, every bit as boring and regulated as the water company; I think the net neutrality fight is best understood as the death throes of an industry that, understandably, doesn't want to be in a commodity business).</p>
<p>I think that this shift means that your Netflix bill will inevitably get more complicated as new option plans are made available. &nbsp;That by itself is a pretty good reason for isolating the DVD-by-mail side of things; those customers want different things, and the situation was already getting confusing. &nbsp;And I think the move really will free the company to concentrate more on the streaming product (I expect that they'll soon be pushing for more uniformity in the interfaces to the service that various integrated media solutions provide, for instance). The poisonous rage of the network operators that carry those streaming products' bits remains a real threat, but if Comcast &amp; co. can be successfully coaxed into a gentle senescence, I think the future of a net-only Netflix is bright.</p>
<p><strong>INCIDENTALLY:</strong> I think all of this can be understood as a huge indictment of Apple. &nbsp;Not that iTunes hasn't been a big success, but they're&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.macworld.com/article/161983/2011/08/apple_axes_tv_show_rentals_for_itunes_apple_tv.html">retreating</a> from the rental/streaming market. &nbsp;They never quite managed to move past thinking of the service as a content-supplier/&quot;we have legal content!&quot; validator for Apple hardware products, nor to meaningfully relax their quality standards (well, except for the iTunes software, of course) in order to compete for the market segment Netflix pursued. It's ludicrous that new receivers don't come with big &quot;iTunes-ready!&quot; stickers on it; that stereo equipment manufacturers have to play catch-up, <em>begging</em> Apple to let them provide iPod support. It's flat-out insane that Airplay is a closed standard, its proprietary nature used to help prop up a consumer router business. &nbsp;A fucking consumer router business! &nbsp;If ever there was a market you wouldn't want to be in... At any rate, it's a reminder that even Apple misses occasional opportunities. &nbsp;And note that I say all this as a mostly-satisfied Apple TV owner. &nbsp;They settled for a lucrative niche when entertainment industry world domination was within their grasp.</p>

<p>But I'm not sure that &quot;gamification is bullshit&quot;, as Bogost maintains. &nbsp;After spending an hour with someone who works for Zynga, I'm convinced it's not that at all. &nbsp;Here's what it is: price discrimination plus a radical version of behaviorial economics. &nbsp;It's the further weaponization of marketing's insights into consumer behavior. It isn't just something dreamed up by morons from the marketing department--it's actually much more frightening than that.</p>

                    <p>I mostly really like The Awl these days -- contra <a class="reference external" href="http://www.quinnnorton.com/said/?p=559">Quinn</a>, I think the site started strong, had a rough patch, and now is back to publishing a lot of great stuff. <a class="reference external" href="http://www.theawl.com/2011/08/was-aaron-swartz-stealing">But this is not a very good article</a>. It's credulous about things that call for skepticism, and skeptical about things that are perfectly reasonable.</p>
<blockquote>
A lot of people seem to believe that it doesn't cost anything to make documents available online, but that is absolutely not so. Yes, you can digitize an academic journal and put it online, but if you mean to offer reliable, permanent availability, it costs a huge amount of money just to keep up with the entropy. Plus you have to index the material to make it searchable, not a small job. Everything has to be backed up. When a hard drive fries, when servers or database software become obsolete or break down, when new anti-virus software is required, all this stuff requires a stable and permanent infrastructure and that does not come cheap. Finally, the more traffic you have, the more it costs to maintain fast, uninterrupted server access; you can see this whenever some little blog is mentioned in a newspaper and its server crashes five seconds later. In the case of JSTOR you are looking at many millions of hits every month, and they can't afford any mistakes.</blockquote>
<p>Actually, <a class="reference external" href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3/#pricing">all this stuff really is pretty cheap</a>. And then there's the other nice thing about the internet: digital content of genuine utility can be more-or-less counted on to self-perpetuate. &nbsp;Release a valuable DRM-free file onto the network and its preservation <em>somewhere</em> is more or less funded automatically by the people who exchange it.&nbsp;Besides, costs continue to fall while the size of scanned documents remains constant.</p>
<p>It's true to some extent that dealing with large-scale distribution and managing bitrot in any particular centralized location does involve costs. &nbsp;So it's not that JSTOR doesn't need money. &nbsp;It's more that we don't need JSTOR.</p>
<blockquote>
There are nearly 19,000 documents in this 33GB download [of out-of-copyright JSTOR documents uploaded in protest by Greg Maxwell], and anyone can take them off The Pirate Bay—and then what? It will tax an ordinary home computer quite a lot to search just this one file, the archives of a single journal of the 1,400-plus currently distributed by JSTOR; that's the tiniest drop in the bucket. The practical futility of Maxwell's gesture only demonstrates that JSTOR is providing an invaluable service to the public, even with respect to documents in the public domain—one that could be improved upon, maybe, but completely impossible for individuals to duplicate using existing technologies.</blockquote>
<p>This is just flat-out wrong. Someone who knows what they're doing will need to OCR those PDFs and dump the results into Solr or something like it, but the actual language-to-be-searched will be a fraction of that 33GB total. &nbsp;This was a big but tractable problem for a home computer a decade ago. &nbsp;Today it's basically trivial; my rough guess is that the task is on par with searching through a decade's worth of email. &nbsp;Besides which, people who actually need this data -- researchers, for instance -- can deal with not-that-much-more-inaccessible tools to get at it.</p>
<p>I'm sure JSTOR's system is impressive. &nbsp;But you know what? &nbsp;There are a lot of people on the internet who can build impressive systems, and many of them are willing to do so and make the results available for free if it's for a halfway decent cause.</p>
<blockquote>
It seems far more likely that if he meant to distribute any JSTOR articles on a file-sharing site, he would have stripped out any copyrighted material first (1.7 million of the 4.8 million articles he downloaded, according to the indictment.) That would be child's play for someone like Swartz to do, and it would certainly have decreased his chances of landing in the soup.</blockquote>
<p>Spoken like someone who's never had to figure out if a document is in copyright (much less do so programmatically). Unless JSTOR had already done the work of figuring this out, it would've actually been a very difficult task. &nbsp;That 1.7 million number is likely representative of documents that can be positively said to be in copyright. &nbsp;It is much harder to positively say that something is out of copyright.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Still,&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/60353785/Untitled?secret_password=1pnh76ns7nc9cnonp1sg#full">the government's indictment alleges</a> that he intended to distribute the stuff to the public &quot;through one or more file-sharing sites,&quot; without offering any details as to why they think he was going to do that. If they hope to prove this allegation based solely on the 2008 Guerrilla Open Access Manifesto, it would seem that they have got an uphill climb.</p>
<p>For one thing, Swartz has been working for years on analyzing huge data sets at Harvard and elsewhere. He has a longstanding professional interest in the study of large data sets. Sure, it's a little bit fishy that he didn't use the network at his home institution in order to access JSTOR. If the allegations in the indictment are true, it would also appear that Swartz took steps to cover his tracks in order to escape detection. I could think of a zillion possible reasons for this with one lobe tied behind my back: Did Swartz want to keep the nature of his work secret from a colleague for some professional reason? Had the Harvard IT department refused to permit him to take that much data down?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't really know what to say about this other than it seems like a stretch to me. &nbsp;Occam, etc.</p>
<p>From that point on, the article is actually pretty good, discussing the strangeness of the government's decision to indict, the specific charges being brought, and ending with a very nice wrapup that appropriately and respectfully invokes Lessig and Malamud. &nbsp;Still, while you all know I'm usually as cranky as anyone about internet utopianism, it really is the case that digital technology is both incredibly powerful and incredibly cheap. &nbsp;JSTOR and the journals are more rentiers than humble archivists struggling to cover costs.</p>

                    <p>Spencer is <a class="reference external" href="http://spencerackerman.typepad.com/attackerman/2011/07/nexus-7.html">right</a>: <a class="reference external" href="http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2011/07/darpas-secret-spy-machine/all/1">this Wired piece about DARPA's Nexus 7 initiative is very good</a>. Nexus 7 is an ambitious data processing effort meant to synthesize both traditional signals (e.g. vehicle tracking data) and unorthodox signals (market fruit prices seem to be their favorite example) into useful intelligence through sophisticated analytic techniques taken from the social sciences.</p>
<p>And it's a pretty good reminder of why I'm wary of the Big Data movement. &nbsp;These were my two favorite bits:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On the surface, there wasn’t much to it: just a graph of violence in the Jalalabad region, and a plot of those fruit prices. When the level of violence was stable — reliably low, or reliably high — so were those prices. Fruit sellers knew what to expect. But when there were sudden swings in the number of attacks, the prices shot up.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Nexus 7 team said, you could use the fruit as an indirect indicator of instability.</p>
<p>The reaction was less than rapturous.</p>
<p>“Right from the start, I’m like: Oh. My. God,” one of the people who attended a Nexus 7 presentation tells Danger Room. “A high school kid could do that.”</p>
<p>Afterward, Dugan presented the pilot as a triumph — a “big breakthrough” that impressed a bevy of four-star generals.</p>
<p>Privately, she was underwhelmed. Dugan was looking for projects that could save troops’ lives, and maybe even bend the direction of the war. By that standard, fruit-price swings seemed pretty inconsequential.</p>
<p>But the presenters maintained an aura of confidence. Oh, this is just a test. Give us more data sources, they said, and we’ll make better connections. We’ve got the hardware: a cloud computing platform that would soak up all kinds of classified and open source intelligence data. We’ve got the software: these social science PhDs and counterinsurgency veterans, who can figure out how to apply that data to rebuild Afghanistan.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and:</p>
<blockquote>
&quot;One assumed there was some secret mound of data to be exploited. But it’s just not true.&quot;</blockquote>
<p>I've fallen prey to this temptation: thinking that your mastery of <em>awesome tools</em> means you're about to do some <em>awesome stuff</em> (perhaps via some cleverly counterintuitive Freakonomic insight). Unfortunately, it's not that easy. You actually need to have a great idea before great things will happen, and it's difficult to come up with great ideas unless you both know and care -- deeply -- about the topic you're planning to examine.</p>
<p>It's important to acknowledge that the story of Nexus 7 seems to be told, to some extent, from the perspective of people in the military establishment who feel insulted or threatened by the project. &nbsp;But that in itself is telling: it's never a good idea to enter a field of inquiry with the assumption that those who preceded you were well-meaning simpletons -- particularly when your reasons for thinking so boil down to a difference in the complexity of your tools.</p>
<p>I think this same story is about to unfold in the tech industry, albeit with a more cheerful tone. &nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/jobs_for_data_scientists_explode_across_the_market.php">Consider this recent post from Read Write Web about the explosion in job listings mentioning the phrase &quot;data scientist&quot;</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
&quot;Right now, everybody with data knows that there's value in there, that they should be doing something,&quot; says Edd Dumbill, program chair for&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://strataconf.com/">Strata</a>, O'Reilly's new conference on Data.&nbsp;&quot;Trouble is, nobody's entirely clear on the next steps, but they do know that a data scientist can help frame questions and transform data into useful insight.&quot;</blockquote>
<p>They don't &quot;know&quot; this. They're assuming it. &nbsp;And this leaves me worried, because the ability to draw meaning from mountains of information is almost always going to depend on the specific question being examined more so than the tools being used or the investigator's level of enthusiasm for the idea of quantitative analysis.</p>
<p>It's not that I don't believe in the techniques and tools that have these folks so excited. &nbsp;It's not even that I think nothing will come of data-rich firms applying quantitative analytic techniques. These things have got me excited, too! &nbsp;I'm trying to make sure we take advantage of the same kinds of tools at work. &nbsp;Still, there's no substitute for good ideas.</p>
<p>To me, this wave of hype doesn't seem much different from the one that occurred at the start of the last decade. &nbsp;&quot;Look at the power of webservers and online payment processing!&quot; we exclaimed. &quot;Can you imagine the benefits they'll yield when applied to the problem of selling pet food?&quot;</p>
<p>Those things <em>are</em> powerful. But that's beside the point.</p>

                    <p>I am now substantially de-jetlagged! &nbsp;Let's get this published quickly, then deal with the chaos of my inbox.</p>
<p>Matt was nice enough to <a class="reference external" href="http://thinkprogress.org/yglesias/2011/06/19/248045/campaign-spending-and-broadcast-media/">respond</a>; if you haven't already seen it, you should go read it. A few quick things, presented in bullet form because I think trying to write narrative transitions often gets me in trouble:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Matt's right that broadcast spending matters most at the top, of course. &nbsp;I would suggest, though, that this affects many if not all other levels of office, as politicians feel obligated to give to one another in order to reify and ascend their parties' hierarchies.</li>
<li>When discussing broadcast media, I really meant to do so in the context of independent expenditures. &nbsp;It was foolish of me to link to the Obama campaign's spending breakdown -- that gesture, intended to convey the staggering scale of communications costs, mostly just confused the issue. &nbsp;The point I wanted to make was that restricting speech that affects a race but which is made by an entity other than one of the candidates' campaigns is thorny, but perhaps not as thorny as we pretend: the mediums of expression that are most relevant to this problem aren't, shouldn't and never will be places were we can guarantee perfectly free speech.</li>
<li>Still, I admit I probably emphasized broadcast more than it deserved simply because it was rhetorically convenient for me. &nbsp;I don't know if there are SuperPACs paying for (non-coordinated!) GOTV efforts -- I suspect that campaigns wouldn't like that idea, but who knows. But I'm sure that plenty of them are paying for direct mail, which is immune to the critiques I leveled at broadcast media. And I've read some decently compelling evidence that campaign professionals consider broadcast media and direct mail to be substitutable.</li>
<li>As for spending by campaigns themselves: I suppose I'd personally be open to the idea of providing a <a class="reference external" href="http://thinkprogress.org/yglesias/2011/06/19/248158/only-15-percent-of-virginia-house-of-delegates-seats-are-being-contested/">floor</a> of support for candidates, but I wonder how much of a difference it'd make. &nbsp;It would be silly to extend the analogy very far, but in some other culturally important areas, revenue sharing sure seems less helpful at generating healthy competition than salary caps have been. &nbsp;Besides which, it seems like more robust electoral competition is something you'd pursue to make elected officials more representative of the electorate's views. &nbsp;To the extent that this is a problem at all, my impression is that institutional structure is the bigger culprit.</li>
<li>I've heard various political science professors endorse variations of &quot;the more politics the better!&quot; but this has always struck me as pretty silly -- either&nbsp;a manifestation of a fairly pathetic urge to be counted the most cynical, counterintuitive and therefore sophisticated guy in the room; or an overextension of the term &quot;politics&quot; to encompass every aspect of every democratic system for reconciling conflicting claims, to the extent that the term loses much of its meaning.</li>
</ul>
<p>Maybe this is horribly consequentialist, but for me it really comes down to this: for several reasons it strikes me as deeply unwise to put our working legislators on a&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2010/12/voinovich_spills_the_beans_sen.html">constant fundraising treadmill</a> (particularly given our legislative institutions' other tendencies toward&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2010/12/21/keeping-congress-competent-staff-pay-turnover-and-what-it-means-for-democracy/">self-lobotimization</a>). Yet that's where we've found ourselves. &nbsp;Efforts to untangle this problem quickly run afoul of speech rights. &nbsp;But the speech rights in question almost invariably belong to people who wield incredible financial, social and political power. &nbsp;What's more, the rights in question tend to be concerned with the amplification of those individuals' speech in forums that are not and will never be available to most people, rather than rights associated with getting one's message across some threshold of discoverability.</p>
<p>My principled friends will be aghast, but the idea of trampling on that particular subset of super-speech rights bothers me basically not at all. &nbsp;Sure, I would prefer a solution to this dilemma that arrives in a neatly-packaged, internally consistent collection of philosophical and legal thought. &nbsp;But if I can't have that, I will be content with something that wades through the pragmatically-minded muck along with much of the rest of our system.</p>
<p>(For the record, I would be happy to support a compromise that allows unlimited political contributions in support of speech that takes the form of&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://ronpaulblimp.com/">blimps</a>)</p>

                    <p>There's no way to write this post without seeming like I'm just being a shill for my employer. And yet, as I write it, I need to be careful to point out that I am <em>not speaking on behalf of my employer</em>, and could easily get myself in trouble for posting it. Really, this is all downside for me.</p>
<p>But in the last week a couple of friends have written posts that begin, more or less, with &quot;Given that campaign finance legislation is fundamentally incompatible with the first amendment...&quot; And look, yes, I know that this is, if not the legal status quo, then at least what awaits us at the bottom of the legal slip and slide that our juridical institutions are gleefully hurtling down. But let me be the lame parent worrying about what all this water will do to the lawn: I still don't buy that money is speech.</p>
<p>It's probably necessary to look at this from a couple of angles. First, there's the case in which money is given to someone else in order to support that candidate or cause's speech. Our campaign finance laws remain relatively strong in this area, and understandably so: if it's not <em>my</em> speech, my speech rights aren't (as) relevant. Handing you a pen is not speech; neither is handing you a dollar to buy a pen.</p>
<p>The situation is admittedly more difficult in cases where we're talking about restricting individuals' ability to spend on their own expressions when those expressions benefit particular candidates or political outcomes. In a theoretical sense, I get it. It's an intractable problem. That pen might amount to a precondition to self-expression for you, making it, from a practical perspective, indistinguishable from the act of expression itself. If we can't summon the political will to guarantee everyone access to pens, we can sure as hell not start drafting pen-control laws and asking Staples cashiers to enforce them (in the case of the FEC, this is a generous metaphorical comparison).</p>
<p>I love philosophical abstractions as much as the next guy, but let's get real: most types of communication are cheap. <a class="reference external" href="http://www.opensecrets.org/pres08/expend.php?cycle=2008&amp;cid=n00009638">This is about broadcast media</a>. The money-in-politics discussion is about domination of a small number of more-or-less zero-sum distribution channels, most of which are subject to physical constraints that necessitate a high level of regulation. Your freedom to speak within these channels is already severely limited in both a <a class="reference external" href="http://transition.fcc.gov/eb/oip/">legal</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.google.com/search?q=nbc+won't+air+ad">practical</a> sense.</p>
<p>I think we ought to distinguish between advertising and speech. I think everyone's got a right to express what they believe and to see if it can convince others. I don't think the right to force your message in front of others' eyeballs is nearly so sacrosanct. It used to be pretty difficult to disentangle these two things, but every hour we spend marching deeper into the digital age makes the distinction clearer.</p>
<p>Or so it seems to me, anyway. I'm not claiming that our existing set of campaign finance laws is coherent; I'm not claiming that engineering a legally defensible alternative would be easy (though I have some ideas, many of them admittedly involving a jackboot on the throat of television ad sales executives). But I do think that the conversation about money's role in politics needs to be tied more closely to a conversation about broadcast media's role in politics. Personally, I think the latter is both a huge waste of resources and a wellspring of perverse incentives for politicians and the electorate. And I don't think it deserves to hide within the aegis of rights that we quite correctly treat with reverence.</p>
