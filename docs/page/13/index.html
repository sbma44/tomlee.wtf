                    <p>Yesterday <a class="reference external" href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2010/04/queueing">Ryan posted</a> about the dread he feels at the prospect of one day having to take his daughter to an amusement park.</p>
<blockquote>
Specifically, I'm dreading the queues. Endless, winding queues, lasting hours, all to ride a roller coaster for two minutes.</blockquote>
<p>He proposes the creation of a market for individual rides -- whether through actual pricing or some sort of scrip -- which would help shorten lines and, hopefully, do a better job of letting customers use the attractions they value most.</p>
<p>I don't like this idea! I am a roller coaster enthusiast -- though each visit to a theme park makes it clearer that adult bodies are physiologically unsuited for such entertainments -- and I would hate to have to participate in a market for rides. I'm sure it would lead to more efficient outcomes in a narrow sense. But the increasing body of literature around the power of &quot;free&quot; as a price point indicates why this would still be a drag: freedom from calculation, judgment and decision-making has utility all its own. This would be no kind of way to run a society, but for entertainment it often makes a lot of sense to excuse people from the burden of weighing pros and cons. Folks really like all-you-can-eat buffets, even if they have to pay a little more. Besides, nobody wants to take their kid to the park and be asked why the rich families don't have to wait in line.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I think technology can save us (surprise!). Disney's got something called <a class="reference external" href="http://disneyworld.disney.go.com/guest-services/fast-pass/">FASTPASS</a> that lets park visitors claim an electronic reservation for a ride, then wander around the park until the appointed time. Limits on the each customers' number of simultaneously-held reservations are enforced to prevent opportunistic oversubscription, and dynamic displays showing the expected wait times help regulate demand across the park's attractions. You spend much less time in line listening to the loud, looping and probably-broken pre-ride video presentation, and the park has successfully put you back into the market for games, concessions and other add-ons. Everyone wins! Plus, with the ubiquity of mobile phones, the up-front cost to implementing such a system is driven way, way down -- all you need to do is hand out some ziploc bags to make the system log flume-compatible.</p>
<p>So there. I think these systems will proliferate, solve Ryan's worry, AND still provide enough interesting data for an econ paper or two. I think everyone can get excited about that.</p>

<div class="line">Hello,</div>
<div class="line">The following material has been removed from your account in response to a DMCA take-down notice:</div>

</blockquote>
<p>As he points out, this didn't actually point to any copyright-violating files.&nbsp; The link just discusses the leak.</p>
<p>I don't think this is deliberate suppression of the <em>discussion</em> of piracy.&nbsp; What I think is probably happening is this:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Copyright-holding Corporation A pays Technical Vendor B to monitor Twitter for leaked albums. They can do this cheaply by creating an automated process that looks for band names and the word &quot;leaked&quot;, or through some other simple heuristic.</li>
<li>Matching results are turned into DMCA takedown notices with a minimum (or no?) human intervention.</li>
<li>Twitter receives the notices, removes the user's content and notifies the user with a minimum (or no?) human intervention.</li>
</ol>
<p>The user is then free to make a counterclaim!&nbsp; Unfortunately, there is not a button or script for that.&nbsp; Before long he or she will have to pick up the phone, find a lawyer, and pay that lawyer to fight on their behalf.</p>
<p>This is flatly unacceptable.&nbsp; The need for a DMCA-style simplification of the takedown process is understandable, but this level of automation of the process should not be tolerated.&nbsp; As currently structured, it's a surefire recipe for Type I errors.&nbsp; We've known this about the DMCA takedown process all along, of course, but this really brings it into stark relief -- there's a huge power asymmetry introduced by the DMCA, so much so that the rights-holders it empowers can't even be bothered to follow a link and read a paragraph.&nbsp; Why would they?&nbsp; There's no incentive for them to.</p>
<p>There ought to be substantial sanctions -- payable to the counterclaimant -- that can be recovered when copyright holders suppress legal content through spurious claims.&nbsp; Let's get some of those much-maligned trial lawyers up in here.</p>

                    <p>My colleague Kerry assures me that I am insufferable when I talk about the interesting things I do in an increasingly desperate attempt to forestall... well, whatever [INSERT SUBJECT OF EXISTENTIAL DREAD HERE].</p>
<p>Still, with apologies, I will persist.&nbsp; First, though: Emily tells me that research indicates that the utilitarian return on investment is better for experiential purchases -- things like classes -- than anything else.&nbsp; I believe this!&nbsp; I've been on kind of a class-taking kick lately: surfing, trapeze, microcontroller-programming and now welding.&nbsp; It's working out so far. Take some classes!</p>
<p>But okay, welding.&nbsp; I'm taking a class at the Art League.&nbsp; It's very affordable, but apparently in high demand.&nbsp; The subject is oxy-acetylene welding -- there are opportunities to learn to use MIG and arc welding setups, but the focus is gas welding, which is both easier and less dangerous than those alternatives.</p>
<p>Welding is neat.&nbsp; In the past, I've done quite a bit of soldering, a process in which a low-melting alloy is used to make electrical connections.&nbsp; This background proved to be both helpful and confusing.</p>
<p>It was helpful when cutting metal.&nbsp; This is probably the coolest thing I've done in the class -- it's a very different operation from welding.&nbsp; The oxy-acetylene flame is used to heat the steel to a yellow-hot state, at which point you press a lever on the apparatus that projects a jet of pure oxygen onto the heated spot.&nbsp; The steel then serves as the fuel, sending sparks everywhere.&nbsp; The oxygen both fuels the reaction and physically pushes the molten steel away.&nbsp; It's an interesting trick, playing with metal right at the edge of liquefaction, trying to melt some but <em>not too much</em> of the metal in order to blow away an optimally precise slice of steel.&nbsp; Soldering electrical components can definitely convey an understanding of how metal melts and flows.&nbsp; I was pretty good at cutting right from the start.</p>
<p>I sucked at welding.&nbsp; You learn to be tentative when soldering: you do have to work quickly, before the flux burns off, but in general you learn to be careful about applying heat.&nbsp; Too much and you'll burn the component; better to back off and resolder, if necessary.&nbsp; This isn't the case with welding. You need a lot of heat, and to patiently wait as the structure of the piece begins to collapse, forming an entirely new and unified hunk of metal.&nbsp; It's unnerving to watch this happen.</p>
<p>It gets even worse when you start to incorporate a feeder rod.&nbsp; I'm assured that this makes for a stronger (abeit less attractive) weld than working without one, but it sure is frustrating.&nbsp; When you feed solder into a joint, it dissolves, flows, incorporates.&nbsp; The feeder rod really wants to <em>stick</em>.&nbsp; Gently rocking it back and forth sort of works -- I can see how this will eventually make sense -- but it feels pretty unnatural.&nbsp; Particularly given that your other hand is manipulating an insanely powerful jet of superheated gas.</p>
<p>Anyway!&nbsp; Below is some evidence of my efforts at cutting, and my first and second weld (each of which is half with-rod and half without).&nbsp; It's all quite fascinating, I'm sure.</p>

                    <p>Now it can be said:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Those of you who enjoyed the new Titus Andronicus record -- which should be all of you, as it's really good -- would do well to reconsider the Bright Eyes records <em>Digital Ash in a Digital Urn</em> and <em>I'm Wide Awake It's Morning</em> (and maybe the rest of the oeuvre; I couldn't say). At the time of their release, I can't recall any friends saying anything even vaguely nice about these albums, with two exceptions: 1) Lindsay expressed delight at the phrase &quot;hoodie-clad trim&quot;, which I suppose doesn't really count, and b) Susan agreed with me that they were good and hey maybe all this NEXT DYLAN BUSINESS was maybe not so crazy, potentially? No: probably it was crazy! But pause for a moment and consider that, statistically speaking, Susan is almost certainly both smarter AND deadlier than you. Then reflect on whether you have given Conor Oberst a fair shake or whether you have discriminated against him just because he has <em>so many feelings</em>. Or because he was overhyped, or because his fanbase uses strange social networking sites that confuse and terrify you.Get past that. They're good albums, is what I'm trying to say, with timbre, cadence and emotional content similar to the Titus album. Worth a shot.</li>
<li>On Monday I listened, for the first time in at least half a decade, to the high points of the first big-hit Everclear LP. You know what? It holds up. This was not actually a surprise to me: I have been an apologist for <em>Sparkle &amp; Fade</em> and <em>So Much For the Afterglow</em> for years now (the other albums: emphatically not). What was surprising: this is an alt-country album! Sort of, anyway. The guitar work is a bit too clean, and there's nobody playing pedal steel while chain-smoking. But try listening to the phrasing of the songs on <em>S&amp;E</em> with the words &quot;Son Volt&quot; in your mind; I think you might be surprised. And anyway albums about heroin always tend to punch above their weight. Reconsider.</li>

                    <p>I hate being a NIMBY. The truth about city life is that it's crowded. Not unpleasantly so, not most of the time, but you're going to find yourself around a lot of your fellow men, and sometimes they'll get in your way and sometimes you'll get in theirs. It's your responsibility to try to hold your tongue in the case of the former and count on your obliviousness to the latter to even everything out. If everyone threw a fit about every inconvenience they had to suffer, none of us could enjoy the things that are great about living together.</p>
<p>But I think the disruptions accompanying the nuclear disarmament summit at the convention center go a bit beyond the normal give and take of city life. I hasten to add that I haven't suffered much personal inconvenience -- walking a few extra blocks on Sunday evening has been about the worst of it. My discomfort is more about how the event feels than what it's done to me, and maybe that means my objections should be ignored. But it's disturbing to see the streets barricaded, to feel suspicious eyes on you as you walk from the grocery story and past an idling Humvee. I don't like that the folks living in the apartments on the same block as the convention center are being physically searched before being allowed into their homes. I don't like that businesses in the area have had to shut down for the duration of the summit.</p>
<p>And it's hard for me to really see the case for hosting this event. DC has a lot of non-negotiable obligations to the federal government, many of them understandable. But the convention center? It's still a business, right? They could have said no, right? That they're sorry, but they can't handle the security requirements; that the economic boost that a convention is supposed to bring would, in this case, be swamped by the disruptions that would ripple across the city; that the city's facilities exist for its residents, and the proposal on the table asked them to make sacrifices without receiving comparable benefits.</p>
<p>Maybe they could have said this, but I think they probably didn't. And now a commuter has died <a class="reference external" href="http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/archives/2010/04/cyclist-killed-by-military-vehicle.php/comment-page-2#comment-1809745">what sounds like a truly horrific death</a> because of the decision to try to protect and accommodate the world's most important people in the middle of a working city.</p>
<p>I'm sorry to be upset by this, because I know this city is filled with suffering that I easily shrug off. It's stupid that I feel angry just because she and I got to work the same way.</p>
<p>But I am angry. Because people online are blaming the victim. Because the security equipment used to protect our leaders has continued to grow even as the threats they face have withered. Mostly because it could easily have been me, or someone I know.</p>
<p>I know it's the federal city. We will grit our teeth and mostly go along, thinking little of pausing for the daily motorcades down Connecticut, contenting ourselves with grumbling half-heartedly about a commuter tax from time to time.</p>
<p>But now that the planners' ever-escalating <em>24</em> fetishization has shown its deadly potential, it needs to be put in check. Military vehicles do not belong within city limits. I'm all for nuclear disarmament, but I hope federal officials take their next high-risk party to a more appropriate location. I intend to insist that city leaders do what they can to make that happen.</p>

                    <p>For the past few Sundays I've been heading over to HacDC for some intro-to-AVR classes run by Nikolas C. It's something I've wanted to learn for a while. Yesterday I actually got the toolchain working and managed to reprogram the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6OMX9pvuwo">Game of Life doohickey</a> that Kriston and I built to do something of my own design. Not anything as cool as the GoL code, admittedly, but still: it's a start. Now the door's open.</p>

<p>The AVR is a particular brand of microcontroller (&quot;uCs&quot; for short) -- the same one that powers the Arduino, in fact. I should maybe explain what that means. Microcontrollers aren't very useful by themselves. They need power supplies, things to interact with, and sometimes some supporting components to protect the relatively delicate chip. The Arduino platform adds a bunch of commonly-used circuitry around an AVR chip. It also provides a software environment -- both on the chip and on the computer you use to write code -- that's easier to work with than vanilla AVR code. With Arduino you don't have to worry about binary arithmetic or anything like that -- the metaphors in use are similar to the ones employed when programming a full-sized computer system. The software environment abstracts that stuff away. It makes for a much less daunting experience, particularly for those who have taken an introductory CS class.</p>
<p>As you might expect, Arduino has to make some sacrifices to achieve this ease of use. The AVR has some interesting features that aren't exposed, or aren't fully exposed, by the Arduino environment. Things like interrupts (a useful way to increase the responsiveness of your application and avoid messy loop structures), variable clock speeds (a good way to save power) and sleep modes (another good way to save power) are more easily worked with through direct manipulation of the AVR. Plus there's the fact that, for many applications, an Arduino is overkill. It's physically larger, it has circuitry for features you may not be using, and it costs $15 bucks or so, instead of as little as a dollar or two for an AVR.</p>
<p>The AVR/Arduino system is actually a great example of the power of abstraction: not only does Arduino make AVR development easier, but AVR taken by itself also represented something of a landmark in the simplification of microcontroller development. That's because you can write programs for the AVR in C, instead of the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.virtualdub.org/blog/pivot/entry.php?id=84">inscrutable assembly code</a> demanded by most other architectures (the PIC family of uC is also popular with hobbyists because it let them program in a flavor of BASIC -- but AVR is supplanting it).</p>
<p>Of course, to a scripting language-oriented CS fraud such as myself, programming in C is still daunting. I haven't really worked with compiled languages since college, and I certainly wasn't any good at them -- there's a <a class="reference external" href="/2010/01/29/the-stack/">threshold of understanding</a> that I didn't cross until years after graduation; I'm still years away from the sophistication on these matters that people like <a class="reference external" href="http://al3x.net">Alex</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://timothyblee.com">Tim</a> possess.</p>
<p>But even they would probably find AVR programming to be a bit bizarre. It mostly involves the manipulation of the specific bits located in specific places in memory. There are helpful macros for this stuff exposed by avr-libc, but figuring them out still involves trudging through <a class="reference external" href="http://www.atmel.com/atmel/acrobat/doc2467.pdf">novel-length PDFs</a>. And since there's obviously no monitor attached to the chip, debugging presents some unique challenges.</p>
<p>My advice to anyone starting down this path would be to find a class, like I did. Having someone who can supply you with a working Makefile counts for a hell of a lot.</p>

                    <p>If there's one flavor of reporting I find more irritating than innumerate science &quot;journalism&quot;, it's got to be the cybersecurity beat. <a class="reference external" href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=125598665">This morning NPR was the offender</a>.</p>
<p>I should admit up front that I automatically assume that anyone employing the prefix &quot;cyber&quot; is an idiot, and this unfortunately means that I'm inclined toward skepticism even when listening to actual experts in the field. But this NPR piece is symptomatic of a undeniably idiotic tendency to lump together every governmental system that takes electricity, then assume that summarizing the first twenty minutes of <em>Transformers</em> and asking &quot;WHAT IF?!&quot; qualifies you as some sort of digital Cassandra.</p>
<p>The piece starts out by discussing Russian vandals' successful efforts to screw with the Georgian government's website -- something that can be plausibly done by a disaffected teenager -- then jumps rapidly to &quot;monkey[ing] with GPS&quot; which involves, you know, <em>satellites</em>, or at least skill at building, concealing and fortifying radio transmitters; and, if anything other than a braindead denial of service, would also require the discovery of a novel attack on the system's design. These things are much harder than checking to see if the recently-launched website of a small ex-Soviet country is running slightly outdated software that someone else has written an exploit for.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Of course, the U.S. military is planning its own cyberattacks. Pentagon cyberwarriors have detailed plans to take down power, telecommunication and transportation systems just about anywhere.</p>
<p>There is just one problem: What if the other side strikes first? In cyberwar scenarios, pre-emptive attacks are favored, and effective retaliation can be difficult.</p>
<p>&quot;We have extremely good cyberoffensive capabilities and almost nothing in the way of cyberdefense,&quot; Clarke says.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?</em> Disrupting the operation of a website is very different from disrupting the operation of the internet, which is very different from interfering with military communication systems, which is very different from interfering with military <em>battlefield</em> communication systems, which is very different from being susceptible to the interception of digital communications. But all of these things are just jammed together, mindlessly.</p>
<p>What kinds of electronic attack are possible? To what extent are our defense systems susceptible to them -- in particular, are those systems at all tangled up with the internet? If not, what economic consequences could plausibly be inflicted on our country by disruption of the internet, and how do they compare to the historical example of, say, a blockade? If an online attack originates from overseas, what countermeasures are available? And do we have a protocol in place with the major backbone operators to implement them?</p>
<p>None of these questions are asked or answered. Blah blah blah cyber. That's it, over and over. This is a multi-part series, so perhaps future installments will resolve this problem. But so far NPR's approach is just to quote a bunch of people in the cyberwar pontification business making ominous intonations about our need to take cyberwar more seriously (i.e. spend more money on people like themselves).</p>
<p>Then there's this:</p>
<blockquote>
For a country whose economy operates largely in cyberspace and whose military pioneered Net-centric warfare, this is a serious failing.</blockquote>
<p>This author pretty clearly has no idea what Net-centric warfare is supposed to mean -- it's just used a nice lexical break from those relentless &quot;cyber&quot;s. Here, <a class="reference external" href="http://fpc.state.gov/documents/organization/33858.pdf">have a CRS report</a>. Yeesh.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>If you ask me, there are two excellent reasons for learning how to surf. When you're young, it seems to be a great way to achieve a lifestyle focused on taking drugs and having sex. And when you're older, the sport is a surefire wellspring for pretentious mystical ruminations, as memorably/disastrously demonstrated by <em>John From Cincinnati</em>*.</p>
<p>Well, I'm not young any more, but I'm also not yet good enough at surfing to bore you about it properly. Emily and I finished our Costa Rican vacation in <a class="reference external" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=dominical,+costa+rica&amp;sll=38.908292,-77.025269&amp;sspn=0.010035,0.017273&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Dominical,+Puntarenas,+Costa+Rica&amp;ll=9.698228,-84.04541&amp;spn=3.25376,4.421997&amp;z=8">Dominical</a>, a town only recently connected to the rest of the country by reliable highways, and still tucked behind an intimidatingly industrial plane of geometrically-arranged oil palms. It's everything you could want from a surf town: if there ever was an authentic local culture to feel liberal guilt about, it was washed away years ago by the slacker tide. Every restaurant is simultaneously a tourist trap and a locals' hangout. Every shop seems both dangerous and sleepy. Everyone is always at the beach; everyone is always hanging out; everyone is beautiful, tanned and weather-beaten. They all look like surfers, because they are.</p>
<p>We stayed a kilometer up the beach, at a place called <a class="reference external" href="http://www.rocaverde.net/">Roca Verde</a>, which has a reputation for hosting a particularly noteworthy and raucous disco every Saturday night. We missed it; for us, the place mostly made an impression as being comfortable, stocked with good food, and run by a scrupulously honest and helpful owner named Frank. He's the one whom we asked to book us a surf lesson -- this was the one thing I came to Costa Rica really wanting to do, and it was the reason we had come to Dominical. Frank left a bunch of voicemails for his preferred surf instructor, but never managed to connect with him. Finally, he reached out to a different guy, a local by the name of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.gatosurfcamp.com/">Jose Obando</a>. &quot;To be honest, this might be better for you,&quot; Frank said. &quot;Jose's probably the best surfer on the beach.&quot;</p>
<p>Well, I'm sure he says that to all the clueless tourists. But Jose was certainly an impressive surfer, and a very good teacher. Emily and I managed to each get up on our first try! The rest of the lesson went well, too -- well enough that I asked if we could take another lesson the following morning, before leaving town. I wanted to ride a real wave.</p>
<p>Jose said okay, so we met him the next day and drove to Dominicalito, a beach just up the road with smaller waves. As I said, our first lesson was on &quot;whitewater&quot; -- waves that had already broken -- and they weren't much to worry about. But further out the swells at Dominical's main beach are pretty big (the guidebooks insist: <em>don't surf while stoned</em>), so it made sense to head to a less ambitious location.</p>
<p>It was still pretty tough. The first day of surfing -- two hours of surfing, really -- had left us beaten up. Emily and I both got sunburns despite conscientiously-applied SPF 30. We'd picked up some nasty board rash, too -- proper technique involves a lot of time spent arching your back and placing your torso's weight on the bottom of your ribcage. For me, this translated into a bruised rib (exacerbated by my stupid tendency to flop onto my board like a wet sack of meat), which is still a minor nuisance three weeks later. And besides the injuries, surfing is <em>hard work</em>, particularly when you don't know what you're doing and are therefore not doing it gracefully, and even more so when you're responsible for managing an incredibly large (though incredibly stable!) surfboard.</p>
<p>By the hour mark of our second lesson Emily and I had both successfully caught several waves, albeit with helpful launching pushes from Jose. But my ass was dragging. Getting back beyond the break was a chore. Waves crashed over me, pushing me back, forcing me to roll with my board, only to be caught by the next wave, wasting energy, slowing down. My ribs burned whenever I lifted my head off the board, preventing me from paddling efficiently to where I needed to go. I still had a helpfully buoyant surfboard attached to me with an ankle leash, in water only slightly over my head. But I was swimming in the ocean, clearly near exhaustion, and there were moments when it started to get a little frightening.</p>
<p>We called it a day a few minutes shy of our lesson's planned two hours. Our board rashes had begun to produce spots of blood; worse, the backs of Emily's legs had been completely devastated by the sun -- her reward for staying on the board and paddling like she was supposed to. I'm glad to have done the second lesson, and I want to do more. But I left it utterly beaten up and exhausted.</p>
<p>So you should dismiss the pretensions to surfing lyricism that you're about to catch me spouting. My intermittently-ecstatic surfing experience was punctuated by a lot of exhaustion, pain and gulps of seawater. But I can definitely see why the surfer-cowboy-poets like it. The way Jose could pick developing waves out of the mass of water beyond the break; or point out riptides by sight; or know when to paddle hard to steal the wave's energy; all that stuff mystifies and fascinates me. It's somewhere between tracking a deer and doing a Fourier transform, and I sort of doubt it can be taught except by making someone's unconscious neural machinery stare at an undulating plane of water for hours on end, bobbing contentedly and not thinking of much of anything at all.&nbsp; And that sounds alright to me, too.</p>
<p>So yes, surfing. I think this could be a pretty good sport for an old guy.</p>

                    <p>This will interest nobody, but I need to complain (and perhaps spare others some fruitless googling): the iPhone version of Safari seems to be broken when using AJAX in offline caching in HTML5 applications.</p>
<p>&quot;Why would you want to use AJAX in an offline app?&quot; you ask, and it's a good question. Well, I'm trying to make an HTML5 interface to the <a class="reference external" href="http://sunlightlabs.com/blog/2010/our-door-opener-science-project/">office door-opening thingy</a>, because the native iPhone version, being a non-App Store offering, will be expiring soon in an irritating way (insert entirely different anti-Apple rant here).</p>
<p>Users will, of course, need network access to open the door. But I don't see any particular reason to make users download the 300-some-K of assets necessary to make a proper <a class="reference external" href="http://www.jqtouch.com/">jQTouch</a> iPhone app work every time they need to get into the office (or change their settings) -- particularly since I'm using a little onSuccess wav file (just for fun). So I set about using some offline caching to keep all that material decidedly on the iPhone, and not subject to the whims of Safari's caching policy.</p>
<p>This works fine until it's time to issue the request to open the door. The cache manifest file, which allows you to specify which items will be stored offline, allows for a whitelisted &quot;NETWORK&quot; section that will never be subject to the cache. Typically, you add your AJAX endpoint(s) to that section. Except in this case that AJAX request is made to a different domain than the one where the application lives (and when the application is being served from an offline cache who knows where it *thinks* it lives?), utilizing the now years-old-but-still-awfully-clever <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP">JSONP</a> to escape the same-domain restrictions of a vanilla AJAX request.</p>
<p>This all works fine, <a class="reference external" href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1911614/how-do-i-avoid-having-jsonp-returns-cached-in-an-html5-offline-application/2572077">according to other people</a>. But not for me. My application's endpoint uses SSL in order to protect users' door-opening credentials, and that seems to make the difference. It just. doesn't. work. If you change the cache manifest, prompting the app to be reloaded, everything will work fine. Once. When you reload the app, pulling from the offline cache, the AJAX request produces a momentary activity indicator in the status bar, but there's no response. (No error, either! Thanks a bunch, Apple and/or jQuery.)</p>
<p>I've tried <a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/p/jqtouch/issues/detail?id=179">updating jQuery</a>. I've tried whitelisting &quot;*&quot;. I've tried whitelisting the http version of the endpoint, and just the path portion of the endpoint, and the full domain name of the endpoint (SSL and not). No dice.</p>
<p>Here's the relevant code, for anyone feeling particularly curious/masochistic. I've tried a lot of variations on it -- at this point I'm pretty sure that this aspect of iPhone Safari circa OS 3.1.2* is just broken. Ah well. No caching isn't the end of the world, but it is kind of annoying.</p>

                    <p>Oh right: back from Georgia, only sort of jetlagged, back up to speed shortly. It was great! But let me share one useful lesson learned on my trip: guys, when flying, wear a jacket.</p>
<p>I wore a jacket on my way out; on my way back, I opted for a frumpier but more practical fleece. The difference in how I was treated by the airline staff was astounding. No <a class="reference external" href="/2010/03/24/they-call-it-wien-which-i-am-still-immature-enough-to-find-hilarious/">offered upgrades to business class</a> on the trip back; in fact, they wouldn't even let me hang up my garment bag -- not because there wasn't space, but because I was flying coach. This was not a problem on the way out.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I'm not going to back down from the idea that wearing dress shoes for 36 hours of travel is a terrible idea. &quot;Hip but important internet guy&quot;: I think that's the sweet spot I want.</p>

                    <p>Aside from some dude spilling tomato juice all over me, my next flight was uneventful. I got into town at 6 this morning, slept for two hours, then put in a full day at the TI Georgia offices. To say I'm going to sleep soundly wouldn't even begin to describe what's about to happen. Past jetlag-sleep episodes have featured slumber so sound that kindly old ladies held mirrors under my nose to check if I was still breathing. But that was after only half as much travel as this time.</p>
<p>But before I hit the sack, here's a video of my extremely comfortable accommodations, and of the broadcasting tower at the top of the hill above me. Driving into Tblisi was fun -- not just because of the high speed employed by my driver, but because of the way the city is lit. Grandiose architecture is lit with sometimes-garish accent lighting, and the effect is really pretty striking. It's near-Eastern Soviet decay under a layer of New Orleans' sinister pageantry -- that's the closest I can come to describing it, anyway. I actually really like it.</p>
<p>The tower in this video doesn't mesh with the color palette or static nature of most of the lighting, but it does seem to have sprung from the same mindset that launched the overall illumination program, which I'm told is only a few years old. The tower was the first thing I could see through the fog from my airplane window, and if it isn't visible from space I'm sure the administration will soon tear it down and build one that is.</p>

                    <p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/4460724758/"><img alt="Vienna!" class="alignright" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4038/4460724758_c1bdec9241.jpg" style="width: 375px; height: 500px;" /></a>I didn't realize exactly what I was getting myself into before this trip. It's not that anything's been a surprise, exactly (in fact, everything has gone almost miraculously well: I've caught every train, made every flight and even took the exact right number of euros out of the ATM for my layover). I wasn't mentally prepared, but I <em>knew</em> I wasn't prepared. It's been something like eight years since I spent a night in Stansted. I'm pretty sure that's the only trip during which I've spent more time in airports.</p>
<p>For what it's worth, the Vienna airport isn't bad. They seemingly want to stamp your passport every time you head to the bathroom, but otherwise I have no major complaints. Free wifi, an okay number of power outlets, and the above-average number of screaming children are offset by relatively humane bathrooms. Protip: the chairs between A and C terminals are your sweet spot for internet access and charging capability.</p>
<p>But this isn't to say that the trip has been sunlight and roses. Tbilisi is not exactly easy to get to, and this weekend, neither is Vienna. I'm told that some storms backed things up, and my flight was overbooked. They offered me business class to add an initial leg to Frankfurt, but I balked: Frankfurt is the only airport I've been through that insists on swabbing your laptop for explosive residue when you're merely trying to get to a connecting flight to the US or a Schengen country. They're nuts over there -- driven mad, perhaps, by the vast empty expanses of their concourse -- and I didn't want to put my connection to Tbilisi at risk: I suspected that if I missed it I'd be losing a full day. Besides, I was sort of looking forward to sightseeing during my layover in Vienna.</p>
<p>Two people at the gate changed my mind. First, the agent, who offered me cash instead of an upgrade. I was still wishy-washy and worried, though, until a grizzled Russian executive, who was lined up at the desk to arrange for a ride in the jump seat to an eye surgery appointment and seemed to be straight out of a Bond movie casting office's &quot;rejected: drunk&quot; pile, emphysematically gurgled assurances to me that the Vienna/Tbilisi transfer was a piece of cake. &quot;It's no problem,&quot; he said, occasionally clutching his throat, &quot;I've done it many times. Besides, you're on the manifest, your bags are checked through. They have to wait for you.&quot; That seemed convincing enough, so I took the deal and started wondering whether the Frankfurt airport had a casino suitable for blowing $400 of Austrian Airways' money.</p>
<p>As it turns out, the gate agent was confused, or he confused me, or I'm just bad at this. My time in Frankfurt was short -- as always, their crazed security almost made me miss my connection -- but I found myself in Vienna pretty much in line with my original schedule, and with much of the day to kill before my flight. By this point I was delirious with fatigue, so I performed the world's slowest toothbrushing, sat on a bench for a while, and eventually figured out how to pick up my voucher, check my garment bag and board the CAT train into the city.</p>
<p>From there I hopped on the U3 to the Stephansplatz -- an efficient but boringly off-the-shelf European subway line and central square, respectively -- then wandered around until I found a cafe that looked bearably non-touristy, but which still had wifi and some English on the menus. Cafe Mozart served me some overpriced but tasty <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tafelspitz">tafelspitz</a>, then I headed around the corner to the Hotel Sacher and had some <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachertorte">Sachertorte</a> (a damning IFA post is forthcoming) before strolling through the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.aboutvienna.org/parks/burggarten.php">Burggarten</a>, then doing my trip from the airport in reverse.</p>
<p>I'm now sitting at Terminal A's Cafe Johann Strauss (as you might have already inferred form the name, it's not as good as the other one), drinking a pleasantly metric-sized beer, and reveling in the suddenly-working-again wifi. My flight's been pushed back an hour, to 10:25, and if everything goes according to plan I should be getting into Tbilisi around 5 or 6 AM. At this point catnaps actually seem to be doing something, and I'm further from collapse than I might have expected. I am really, really, really looking forward to being in a hotel room, though. The vagaries of wifi access and waterproofing mean that I may not be able to liveblog the shower I'm going to take when I get there, but my suspicion is that it's going to be GREAT.</p>
