                    <p><img alt="a 555 timer chip" class="right" src="/static/2007/06/15/20070615_555.jpg" style="width: 250px; height: 250px;" />Ever since <a class="reference external" href="http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,71087-0.html?tw=rss.index">reading</a> about the body-modification folks who've implanted magnets in their fingers I've been <a class="reference external" href="http://www.zunta.org/blog/archives/2006/06/07/oh_dear/">kind of fixated</a> on the idea. Being able to sense magnetic fields seems like it'd be awfully cool. But even if the unavailability of anesthesia for the operation wasn't enough to scare me off, the apparently-guaranteed infection that follows would be.</p>
<p>As my meager knowledge of electronics has grown, the idea of building a tool has begun to seem more feasible, and promises to merely result in finger burns instead of outright amputations. I've been screwing around with a 555 timer and pricing Hall Effect sensors in preparation for building a gadget that'll whistle to me when it feels a field.</p>
<p>But <a class="reference external" href="http://www.instructables.com/id/EXPHY2GW12ERXTRZAS/?ALLSTEPS">look</a>! Someone already built <em>the exact same thing</em> and put it on Instructables. It's a good thing, too, since I a) didn't realize that Hall sensors put out varying voltage instead of resistance and b) wouldn't know how to change a 555's timing on that basis. In fact, due to my unwillingness to untangle resistors and figure out their <a class="reference external" href="http://www.zambetti.com/projects/resistulator/">color codes</a>, my 555 circuit keeps threatening to melt down. I'd still like to put this together, but I may substitute a vibrating motor that I scrounged from a walkie-talkie instead of making it sound-based — turning it into a tactile feedback mechanism seems like it'd do more to satisfy my fingermagnet lust.</p>
<p>At any rate, it's cool to see that the idea's workable, even if it's slightly disappointing to be beaten to the internet writeup of what I thought was an original(ish) idea.</p>
<p>The curious can find a little pedantry from a decidedly underqualified electronics expert after the jump.</p>
<p>The gadget works thanks to three components. First, there's a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.google.com/custom?domains=makezine.com&amp;sitesearch=makezine.com&amp;q=555&amp;sa.x=0&amp;sa.y=0&amp;cof=GALT%3A%23008000%3BGL%3A1%3BDIV%3A%23336699%3BVLC%3A663399%3BAH%3Acenter%3BBGC%3AFFFFFF%3BLBGC%3A336699%3BALC%3A0000FF%3BLC%3A0000FF%3BT%3A000000%3BGFNT%3A0000FF%3BGIMP%3A0000FF%3BFORID%3A1%3B&amp;client=pub-1711976718738240&amp;forid=1&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;oe=ISO-8859-1&amp;hl=en">555 timer</a>, a venerable chip that can be bought at Radioshack for about fifty cents. This ingenious little device can be wired up to do two things: it can either act as a one shot timer, turning on an output for a configurable amount of time and then switching off; or it can act as an oscillator, switching an output on and off continuously at a configurable rate. The first mode of operation is called monostable mode; the second is called astable mode. You generally configure the delay by swapping different-sized resistors and capacitors into a very <a class="reference external" href="http://home.cogeco.ca/~rpaisley4/LM555Monostable.GIF">simple</a> <a class="reference external" href="http://home.cogeco.ca/~rpaisley4/LM555Astable.GIF">circuit</a> that contains the 555. It's great for projects that flash lights or need to trigger action after a set delay, and it makes for a good Baby's First Integrated Circuit. That's certainly why I'm using it.</p>
<p>In this case the 555 is set up to work in astable mode, switching its output on and off very quickly. Its output is connected to the second major component, a piezoelectric element. This is a little ceramic disc that expands and contracts ever so slightly when voltage is applied to it. You may have run into piezoelectrics in advertisements for fancy pseudoscientific skis, or you may have heard about how quartz crystals work to keep time. It's pretty much the same deal. You can buy one at Radioshack for a couple of bucks. In this case the expansion and contraction is occurring so quickly — thanks to the 555 timer — that it actually generates sound waves. I'm not sure what the 555's nominal oscillation range is, but it's not hard to get it to fall within the ~20-20000 hertz range of the human ear.</p>
<p>The final bit is the sensor, which works thanks to something called the Hall Effect. In the absence of a good explanation, I'll simply state that it's magic. The spell amounts to this: stick it in a magnetic field and the voltage of a current run through the sensor will vary based upon the magnetic field's strength. Radioshack doesn't stock these guys, but they can be acquired from Digikey for a few dollars. You also might be able to scrounge one out of those ridiculous battery-powered home security alarms that you stick on windows — you know, the ones that come in blister-packs for $20 or so. That's how the window alarms operate: one side has a permanent magnet in it and the other has a Hall sensor. If the window is opened the magnetic field goes away, the sensor detects the change and an alarm is triggered. Hall sensors are used in all kinds of mechanical systems that need to detect the position of something without actually coming into physical contact with it. <a class="reference external" href="http://www.instructables.com/id/EEVRBRUWWIES9J6KPG/">Here's</a> an instructable where a Hall sensor is used to count how many times a drill head has rotated.</p>
<p>The basic idea here is that the Hall sensor's output changes the characteristics of the circuit that govern the 555's oscillation rate. When that rate changes, the pitch of the sound generated by the piezoelectric element is altered. For a lot of sensors, the internal resistance changes in relation to whatever's being sensed. You incorporate the sensor into the portion of the 555 circuit that determines its timing based on resistance, et voila. But in this case the sensor changes its output voltage, which the instructable author deals with by feeding it into the 555 in a way that is probably pretty simple, but never would've occurred to me.</p>
<p>The rest of the circuit is just stuff to regulate the power supply. It's a pretty simple doohickey, but I still think it'd be fun to build.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>Yesterday Kevin Drum <a class="reference external" href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2007_06/011482.php">quoted a ridiculous excerpt from the Weekly Standard</a> in which Irwin Stelzer frets about CEOs' solidly middle-class-ish income when compared to the titans of Wall Street.</p>
<p>Hilarious as that sentiment is, it may actually be part of a trend. We've had the May issue of <em>Forbes</em> kicking around the office (don't ask me why), and they have a feature on compensation that begins like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">TOP GUNS</div>
<div class="line">Think chief executives get fat paychecks? People who manage piles of money do much better.</div>
</div>
<p>If you fret about the outsize paychecks of America's chief executives, take a look at the kingpins who run private equity and hedge funds. Reaping the rewards of percentage fees, the 20 top Wall Street fund managers earned an average $658 million in 2006 versus $145 million for the 20 highest-paid chief executives. It's almost enough to think the chiefs ought to ask for a raise.</p>
<p>James Simons, who owns an estimates 40% of Renaissance Technologies, sits atop our list with earnings of $1.5 billion. That's $850 million more than the top-earning chief executive, Apple's Steve Jobs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It concludes like so:</p>
<blockquote>
Ever since the days of Cornelius Vanderbilt Wall Street has been a good place to build net worth. There are 16 billionaires on our list of top Wall Street earners but just 4 among the 20 best-paid chief executives.</blockquote>
<p>Those poor fucking guys! And with the rising cost of fuel, do you have any idea how expensive it's becoming to fly the kids to soccer practice on your private jet? That flat tax can't get here soon enough.</p>
<p>Okay, so hedge fund managers are obviously overcompensated. But <em>who cares</em>? The victims of their outsize paychecks are primarily other elites, who simply get a worse return on their investment than they otherwise might. They can take their business elsewhere if they're bothered by this arrangement. But when a company's resources are unjustifiably directed toward the top, many of the people who are negatively affected are typically powerless to do anything about it. <em>That's</em> the problem. CEO whining about how Billy's mom lets him stay up late (on his own private island) is unlikely to convince anyone.</p>
<p>All of which reminds me: <a class="reference external" href="http://www.reason.com/news/show/118315.html">I still need to see 28 Weeks Later</a>.</p>

                    <p>Like everyone else I just finished watching the Sopranos finale. Judging by the reaction among the folks I was watching with, opinions vary on exactly what the ending meant. I feel pretty strongly that Tony got popped. The cut to black occurred in the instant when Tony died.</p>
<p>Otherwise, what's the explanation for the final scene? A slice of Tony's life before life goes on? Nah. That makes no sense. The camera following Meadow was there to put us in the moment and make us start thinking about each shot as an immediate document of what was occurring at that instant. Otherwise it would've been wasted time in an obviously important sequence. And why would the camera have followed the guy in the gray jacket? Just to distract us during the culmination of the series?</p>
<p>No, Tony's gotta be dead. In <a class="reference external" href="http://grammarpolice.net/archives/001334.php">Kriston's comments</a> I mentioned that I thought Tony getting killed by a random, unknown killer was a possibility, and that it wouldn't be satisfying. But I was wrong — it was a good ending. It served nicely to underscore what I consider to be one of the series' central ideas: that violence is available to every living creature at every moment, despite all our fancy institutions, customs and frontal lobes. Those things just make its application a little more complicated.</p>
<p>The episode felt rushed as I watched it, but in retrospect cramming so much in makes sense. We had to be lulled into thinking everything was fine, proceeding as normal — that Tony might get prosecuted, or not, but generally continue to go about the business of a depressed Jersey mobster as defined by the past six seasons. I was even lulled into expecting a happy ending! But they pulled the rug out instead. I had expected something different, but I'm not sure what — or whether it could've been any better.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> There's a pretty good discussion of the ending over in <a class="reference external" href="http://matthewyglesias.theatlantic.com/archives/2007/06/more_sopranos_blogging.php">Matt's comments</a>. There are a bunch of folks interpreting the ending as intentionally ambiguous — a statement about Tony being condemned to live in perpetual suspense — but I don't really buy them. The camera laid things out in a pretty straightforward manner, I think. And my memory may be shaky, but I recall Tony being pretty relaxed in the final scene.</p>
<p><strong>ALLIES:</strong> Ezra's commenters <a class="reference external" href="http://ezraklein.typepad.com/blog/2007/06/sopranos_finale.html">seem to mostly agree with the Tony-got-whacked hypothesis</a>, and have some interesting theories about the episode title. More proof that the progressive blogosphere needs the fresh, objective eyes of a new generation and not the jaded establishment cabal represented by Yglesias and his ilk.</p>
<p><strong>WHILE I'M AT IT:</strong> John From Cincinnati was really abysmal. I was predisposed to dislike it sheerly on the basis of how hard it is to spell — the content of the show didn't do much to invalidate that prejudice. It came off as an SNL parody of a typical HBO drama: a troubled family in a quirky subculture; mannered, unrealistic characters who speak exclusively in non sequiturs, expository dialogue or profound-sounding riddles; a dash of magical realism; and, of course, the requisite heroin addict. I do like watching people surf, but Charles already owns <em>Blue Crush</em> on DVD. I'll probably still watch the next few episodes though, if only because changing channels is hard (and mostly fruitless on Sunday nights).</p>

                    <p>There's an <a class="reference external" href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/06/10/0645232&amp;from=rss">interesting thread</a> over on Slashdot in response to Time Warner's decision to begin selectively throttling some high-bandwidth applications like Bittorrent.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=238001&amp;cid=19457205">This comment</a> is particularly good. The author's right: traffic shaping is going to be necessary for consumer ISPs. At the same time, innovation will be best served if consumers have the option of unfettered access. There generally aren't enough competitors in the consumer arena in a given market to ensure that customers flitting between ISPs will whittle the field down to the optimal offering. And the jump from consumer-priced access to business-priced access isn't feasible — business service is just too expensive, for a variety of reasons. It's a market failure, in other words.</p>
<p>The slashdot nerds favor the same solution I do: metered data transfers. The common response to this is that customers hate metered access. I still don't buy that — millions of people do just fine with metered cell phone access. Pay for a monthly cushion of access, then pay a metered rate for overages. It's simple! And, I think, inevitable.</p>
<p>Sadly, I suspect that this will probably mostly serve as a way for ISPs to gouge geeks with new fees, rather than a revenue-neutral way for them to adopt restructured, more efficient billing practices. Oh well. It's still preferable to having my Bittorrent and encrypted traffic slow to a crawl and not be able to do anything about it.</p>

                    <p>It's been a pretty enjoyable, laid-back weekend. An early night on Friday, a leisurely Saturday afternoon and an extremely fun night out in SW and on H Street — we haven't even gotten to the Sopranos finale yet, but I'm prepared to declare the weekend a success.</p>
<p>It got off to kind of a rough start on Friday, though, as the universe seemed determine to tell me I'm over the hill. Sommer and I went to a party for Ramya, who in addition to being smart and wonderful is a few years younger than us. Our fellow guests were keen to congratulate us on dragging our geriatric selves out to a gathering of young people. Said one: &quot;Man, I'm pretty young and this party makes me feel old. You must feel <em>really</em> old.&quot; Said another: &quot;You're leaving? Yeah, I understand. This party is pretty young.&quot;</p>
<p>For the record, we ducked out early because we'd both had such AWESOME YOUNG-PERSON-TYPE TIMES the preceding weeknights and, uh, wanted to go home and go to sleep. And I'm fine with that! Still, it didn't help that when Charles and I checked out at the same Trader Joe's cashier he got carded but I didn't.</p>
<p>For the record, I remain relatively young and vital, and am prepared to take unwise risks and have opinions about MTV. As long as I can be in bed by 11 while doing it.</p>

                    <p>My software output has dropped off over the last few months. There are a couple of reasons for that: I've had a few private projects to work on for friends, I've been traveling a lot, the winter blues hit me — all kinds of minor things. But a bigger factor is that I've been a little bored with it. The technologies I use most are losing their sheen: PHP isn't glamorous; neither is Perl. I've made some half-hearted stabs at learning Ruby, but I'm a pretty application-oriented guy when it comes to technology (believe it or not) — if a technology doesn't let me do something new and cool, I'm not incredibly interested. Ruby's beautiful, but I'm not ready to spend time on Rails. And as a standalone scripting language, its packages are inferior to Perl. You can do less cool stuff with it (although when you do something you tend to do it in a satisfyingly elegant manner).</p>
<p>The buzzed-about technology platforms have been uninspiring, too. Second Life's brief luster has faded — it looks and performs like crap, there's nothing to do in it but make trouble, and development has to occur in-world, which is frustrating. Twitter's fun and refreshingly simple, but I think other devs have squeezed just about everything out of it that there is to be squozen. I find Facebook to be kind of dumb, and developing for it sounds like no fun at all — a crippled subset of PHP? No thanks.</p>
<p>So I'm stuck waiting for the next big, fun software platform. In the meantime, I've been trying to teach myself about microcontrollers. There's a lot to learn, and it's a bit of a pain in the ass — screwing around with software generally only requires downloading a tarball and firing up a text editor. Working with electronics is harder: debugging is tedious and difficult, and soldering irons take a while to warm up. And although it's a pretty cheap hobby, it's still more expensive than software. I've been doing a lot more reading than wiring.</p>
<p>Still, the potential for making technology interact with the physical world is irresistible, and I've gradually been piecing together the necessary knowledge from the inscrutable materials scattered across the web.</p>
<p>All of which is my way of introducing <a class="reference external" href="http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/present.php?p=BEE-1-PowerSupply">Spark Fun's tutorials on the subject</a>, which breezily cover the vast majority of things I've taught myself about uCs over the last few months. It sure would've been nice to have this a few months back. If you're interested in the subject, or even just curious what uCs are and can do, give it a read.</p>

                    <p>Ezra <a class="reference external" href="http://ezraklein.typepad.com/blog/2007/06/faith.html">wonders</a> why one religion can be considered more worthy of belief than another, using Christianity and the Flying Spaghetti Monster as examples:</p>
<blockquote>
The flying spaghetti monster and what-have-you are clearly not belief systems with the demonstrated resiliency or applicability of Christianity, but my crude understanding of the way faith works in all this doesn't provide much illumination as to why [Christianity and other mainstream religions] are more worthy of faith, as opposed to a sort of for-the-good-of-society adherence.</blockquote>
<p>But the answer is pretty simple, isn't it? The Flying Spaghetti Monster is designed to be an enormous &quot;fuck you&quot; to people of faith. It's pretty funny, but an idea grounded in that sort of aggressively negative impulse is obviously unworthy of genuine respect.</p>
<p>Other religions were designed for more genuine reasons, and those reasons matter to people. The extent to which a belief system appears to be genuinely concerned in helping its followers — that's important. I think this can be hard for devout atheists to see, because they tend to believe that all organized religions amount to systems of enslavement and oppression (whether or not they were intentionally designed to be) — religions' practical badness may vary, but they're all theoretically distasteful in the same way. I think that's a perfectly coherent way of looking at things, but it does assume that the observer is less naive than a large chunk of the earth's population. That's not necessarily an untenable position to be in — but while you're there, you should do your best to not be an ass about it. That means no <a class="reference external" href="http://www.subgenius.com/">ironic religions</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://evolvefish.com/">Darwin fish</a> or <a class="reference external" href="http://www.slate.com/id/2135499/">zealous anti-evangelism evangelism</a>.</p>
<p>Reducing all religions to one undifferentiated mass of irrationality is a bit hubristic. I think it's not unreasonable to say that if a tradition has meant a lot to a lot of people and isn't a completely transparent scam (e.g. Scientology), then it deserves to be accorded more deference than religious thought-experiments like the FSM. It's just a matter of showing respect for your fellow human beings, some of whom probably even deserve it. A tiny sliver of benefit-of-the-doubt isn't too much to ask.</p>

<p>More immediately: Charles is playing at Chief Ike's on Thursday. I guess that Aaron, Spencer and Bayes will be there too. You should still come, though.</p>
<p>And finally, EVEN MORE immediately, I think Emily and I will be heading down to the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.olddominionbrewhouse.com/">Old Dominion Brewhouse</a> tonight to consume towers of beer*, watch the NHL finals in glorious HD and, in my case, write the morning roundup.

                    <p>Via <a class="reference external" href="http://www.unfogged.com/archives/week_2007_06_03.html#006919">Unfogged</a> via <a class="reference external" href="http://highclearing.com/index.php/archives/2007/06/04/6562">Jim Henley</a> comes an extremely interesting feature in New York Magazine about <a class="reference external" href="http://nymag.com/news/features/2007/profit/">how NYC businesses make their money</a>. You can see the markup on fish at Nobu, how dollar stores stay in business and how to get into the fast-paced and exciting crystal meth industry.</p>
<p>But <a class="reference external" href="http://nymag.com/news/features/2007/profit/32900/">this</a> is the most arresting of the slides. You know, I've been reading <a class="reference external" href="http://pipeline.corante.com/">Derek Lowe's excellent blog</a> for a while now — he's a chemist working in the pharmaceutical industry, and provides fascinating looks at how the industry works on a regular basis. Unsurprisingly, he's more sympathetic to the drug companies than the average American. And he does a good job of convincing readers that these corporations aren't the merciless profit engines that we all imagine them to be. He's got me at least partially convinced — I stand ready with Lowe-penned rebuttals to arguments about universities doing all the drug discovery work, and a sense of pity for those poor executives who are stuck with astoundingly large bills for clinical trials. What else can they do, though, but stalwartly defend the public's health?</p>
<p>But the NY Magazine graphic undercuts all that. Everyone knows that drug companies spend huge amounts of money on marketing. I hadn't realized that the amount dwarfs the cost of trials, though.</p>
<p>And, having just read <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/03/health/03docs.html?_r=1&amp;oref=login">Sunday's article</a> about doctors continuing to receive payments for research, speaking and trials even after public disgraces, I'm left even less sympathetic. Lowe <a class="reference external" href="http://pipeline.corante.com/archives/2007/06/03/pecunia_non_olet.php">blogged about it</a> and also didn't come away happy. I agree with him that it's unlikely that drug companies are selecting <em>for</em> incompetent doctors. But the fact that they're paying even the bad ones implies that a large proportion of that &quot;marketing and sales&quot; budget goes to shoveling money at every doctor in sight. Presumably this is done to generally shift prescribing habits toward particular companies' medications — or at least to avoid falling out of favor when some other company's busty new sales rep comes by with promotional scrip pads and promises of golf junkets.</p>
<p>After all, that immense promotional budget couldn't <em>all</em> go toward commercials of newly-continent men toasting each other with water, could it? The evening news/<em>Wheel of Fortune</em> block simply doesn't have that much ad inventory.</p>
<p>I wonder whether this is the sort of thing that universal health care is supposed to solve. Maybe my wiser friends can clue me in. I can imagine a plan with a formulary making these sorts of payouts pointless. But it seems like it'd have to be a pretty strict formulary — probably stricter than would be medically wise.</p>
<p>Anyway, I'm not entirely sure why I'm blogging this. My best guess is that Ezra emits some sort of electromagnetic field that makes people interested in healthcare. I'm sure it'll wear off soon.</p>

                    <p>Catherine needs some help getting her <a class="reference external" href="http://outtamindouttasite.typepad.com/outtasite/2007/06/best_morning_ev.html">Kristen Bell voicemail</a> off her phone and onto the internet. As it happens, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.zunta.org/blog/archives/2006/01/05/usc_thoroughly/">I have some experience in this area</a>. It's pretty simple to do, but it still seems worthwhile to write it up in order to better preserve future generations' novel and/or hilarious voicemails.</p>
<p>So:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">Download <a class="reference external" href="http://www.skype.com">Skype</a> and buy some SkypeOut credit so that you can make calls to non-Skype phone numbers — in this case, your voicemail system.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Use some software to record Skype's output. On the PC, <a class="reference external" href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/">Audacity</a> should work, although you may need to fiddle with your Windows sound settings to make sure it's recording from the right sound source. On the Mac you'll want to use <a class="reference external" href="http://www.rogueamoeba.com/audiohijack/">Audio Hijack</a>, the free trial of which should work great for this purpose (provided that your VM is less than ten minutes long).
Audio Hijack is pretty simple to use: first, make sure Skype is closed. Then launch AH. Click the new button, name the entry &quot;Skype&quot; (or whatever else you'd like to call it) and point it toward the copy of Skype in your Applications folder. Close the dialog, highlight the new &quot;Skype&quot; entry, click Hijack. A copy of Skype will launch — but this version will pipe all of its sound through Audio Hijack. You can start and stop recording of this sound with the &quot;Record&quot; button that sits to the right of the &quot;Hijack&quot; button.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Dial your own phone number and let it go to voicemail. While your voicemail greeting plays, hit the star button on Skype's virtual keypad (this is how it works for T-Mobile — if your carrier's voicemail system works differently, get in touch with them to see how to check messages from phones other than your mobile). Then enter your PIN. You should now be in your voicemail menu, able to navigate using Skype's virtual keypad. Start recording in Audio Hijack or Audacity (don't do it while you're still entering touchtone commands, lest some weirdo steal your voicemail info). Get the voicemail to play and end the call. Stop recording in Audacity or Audio Hijack.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Edit the file that was just recorded (Audacity is a good choice for this on the Mac, too — whether you're on Mac or PC, make sure to install <a class="reference external" href="http://spaghetticode.org/lame/">this software</a> so you can save from Audacity to MP3 format). If you're using Audacity, the audio will already be in the editor, ready for pruning and saving. Audio Hijack places its recordings in a subdirectory of your Music folder by default. Once you've got the file properly edited, save to MP3, post to the internet and revel in its awesomeness.</p>
</li>
<li><div class="first line-block">
<div class="line">Oh, and to make it really easy for people to listen to this or any other MP3 on your website, create a hyperlink to the MP3, then include this line of code somewhere in the entry (or in your page's template):</div>
</div>
<blockquote>
<pre class="literal-block">
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;http://del.icio.us/js/playtagger&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
<p>That's it! I may have failed at making it sound easy, but trust me: once you figure it out the first time, it's all pretty intuitive.</p>

<p>Previously the only place I knew for acquiring Arduinos was <a class="reference external" href="http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/advanced_search_result.php?keywords=arduino&amp;x=0&amp;y=0">Spark Fun</a>. And although I like Spark Fun a lot, the $40ish price tag for an Arduino had me eying the possibility of learning how to directly program and use the AVR microcontrollers that make up the Arduino's heart, without using the other features that the Arduino platform makes available. $40 is a considerably bigger outlay for a pointless home automation project than an AVR (which only costs a few dollars) and some components I already have lying around.</p>
<p>But Modern Device seems to have realized some savings by pulling the USB-to-serial chip off the Arduino board and counting on it being in the programming cable. There's something to be said for having it on-board the chip — if you want your Arduino project to talk to a PC, you'll want the USB-to-serial interface to always be present. But if you're building an embedded device that stands on its own, there's no need for that functionality except when you're loading your program.</p>
<p>Of course, all of this is possible because the Arduino is an <a class="reference external" href="http://www.arduino.cc">open source platform</a>. Here's hoping they keep gaining marketshare and driving down prices. Competitors like Parallax may offer chips with more capabilities, but they're proprietary and more expensive. And given the low cost of full-blown PCs these days, the returns on adding functionality to a general-purpose hobbyist microcontroller begin to diminish <em>very</em> rapidly. There's just not much point in <a class="reference external" href="http://makezine.com/10/propeller/">building speech synthesis</a> into a relatively hard-to-use uC when a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.acrosser.com/Product/Embedded%20PC/3.5%20Biscuit%20SBC/sbc_eden_b1651.html">complete</a>, tiny <a class="reference external" href="http://gumstix.org/">embedded PC</a> can be had for a little over $100.</p>

                    <p>Well, I'm back. I brought with me a tan, a briefly-broken camera, five new pounds of body fat and a profound sense of bewilderment at having <a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/medildo/sets/72157600306784210/">missed my college reunion</a>.</p>
<p>Not that I would have gone — it would have been nice to see old friends, but I wouldn't have wanted to leave my vacation early. But I'm a little miffed that I didn't heard a peep about it from UVA. I guess they don't bother keeping track of you if you don't join the alumni association — something that I refused to do, despite many lame entreaties. &quot;Free Burrito Dinner!&quot; they'd proclaim, &quot;You just have to join the alumni association!&quot;</p>
<p>A delicious burrito did sound pretty good at the time. But since the deal basically amounted to $250/burrito, I declined. Admittedly, I wouldn't have had to make any payments for several years (it's the burrito interest that kills you). But the sense that someone was trying to trick me in an insultingly stupid way led me to foreswear the alumni association permanently. Hence: no reunion mailings.</p>
<p>I'm much happier to have spend that time at the beach, anyway. And there are pictures! My own collection is a little truncated, both due to apathy and to sand getting into my camera partway through the trip, making it unable to focus on anything. A little zooming in and out seems to have dislodged the wayward grain, though, and everything's okay again. Here are the ones I managed to snap before that happened:</p>
