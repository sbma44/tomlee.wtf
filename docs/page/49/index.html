                    <p>Let me preface this by saying that I am sorry to be writing it. There is nothing I wish for more than our people to live in mutual prosperity and comity. However, I feel that I can no longer remain silent.</p>
<p>It's an open secret that there are one or more undocumented mice living in this apartment. Although the arrangement is kept off the books, most of us adopt a live-and-let-live attitude with regard to it. You perform the vital burrowing and crumb-removal jobs that other apartment residents are unwilling or too large to do. In return we forbid our friend Jon from bringing his snakes over when he visits. The arrangement works well: perhaps someday your children will be able to live a better life as detectives, professional rescuers, or confidantes to exiled princesses. I'm even willing to fund the training and tiny anthropomorphic articles of clothing that they'll need to pursue these dreams.</p>
<p>But let's be frank: our peoples have something of an uneasy truce. You're here whether I like it or not. Everyone knows that proposals to build better walls or do the dishes in a timely manner are little more than the lunatic ravings of the Pat Buchanans and Lou Dobbs of the world. But just because we can't get rid of you doesn't mean we can't make your life <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falconry">more difficult</a>. It's in your best interest to work with us, not against us.</p>
<p>To be blunt, the events of the past 24 hours have been a grave breach of our unspoken covenant. You are not on the lease, and consequently you are not entitled to collect the services that are available to other apartment residents — in this case, mortuary services. We're not running some rodent hospice here, you know.</p>
<p>In the future, please ensure that your loved ones expire somewhere off the premises, or at the very least not in my room. Further, in the event of an accidental death on-premises I require prompt notification — preferably by email (and in an appropriately apologetic tone). Finally — and I can't stress this enough — <em>embalming or cremation must be conducted promptly</em>.</p>
<p>I am sure that this must be a difficult time for the family of the individual in question. Nevertheless, I must demand your prompt consideration and immediate compliance with these directives.</p>
<p>Oh yeah! I'm not issuing any more driver's licenses, either. I don't care what Geraldo said on O'Reilly.</p>

                    <p>Courtesy of a Saturday visit to the National Arboretum (or Arbotreeum, as one cellphone-using patron near us called it). It's pretty nice out there, and easy to get to on the weekend thanks to the X6 bus. In fact, it's so pleasant that you can easily forget how close you are to the Washington Times building.</p>
<p>They've got a bunch of plants &amp; stuff, I guess, but my botanical photography skills are pretty poor. This seemed worth showing, though: DC's state tree. It's surprisingly non-crappy, especially compared to, say, Indiana. Now <em>there's</em> a sorry-ass tree.</p>

                    <p>Look, I know that everybody's <a class="reference external" href="http://news.independent.co.uk/environment/wildlife/article2449968.ece">very concerned</a> about the disappearing honeybees. For the record, I am pro-bee: I enjoy consuming their sugary vomit both on toast and in tea. And out of all the invertebrates I think they run the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ilovebees.com/">best alternate reality games</a>.</p>
<p>But the last couple of weeks have seen a ridiculously large portion of the internet devoted to concern about them. It's difficult to find a comment thread that doesn't have someone chiming in about the fucking bees. &quot;This is somewhat OT,&quot; they'll say, &quot;But have you heard about how cell phones are killing bees? I'm just as concerned about [Bush administration malfeasance / a blogger code of conduct / Sanjaya getting voted off Idol] as anyone else, but if we lose the bees we'll have bigger things to worry about.&quot;</p>
<p>This is frequently accompanied by a quote from Albert Einstein that, in an oddly contemporary, half-colloquial formulation, opines about the agricultural importance of honeybees, despite Einstein seemingly possessing no particular expertise about either subject (at least when the bees in question are traveling at less than the speed of light). I'm skeptical of this quotation's provenance, but I do kind of like the idea of attributing random boosterism to history's great thinkers. For instance, did you know that Rene Descartes is frequently credited with coining the phrase &quot;Reduce, Reuse and Recycle&quot;? Or that John Donne was fond of composing epigrams pointing readers to the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.climatecrisis.net/takeaction/carboncalculator/">climatecrisis.net carbon calculator</a>? It's true! I'm pretty sure I read it on Wikipedia the other day.</p>
<p>Well, relax. According to a marginally-more-reputable source, the bees are probably going to be fine. As we drove to Stanford, Emily and I heard a full hour-long show on NPR about the disappearing insects. I can't find a URL for the show — this was the Bay area, so I guess it's probably only available on the goddamn WELL — but trust me: it was authoritative-sounding.</p>
<p>The roundtable discussion featured an entomologist whose lab was conducting the largest nationwide survey of colony collapse disorder, another entomologist who he seemed to not like very much, and a guy who'd written a book about California bees and, I think, lived among them and learned their ways. A parade of well-meaning San Franciscan hybrid owners called in with every possible bee-killing grievance that you, I and the rest of the internet could think of — electromagnetic radiation, GM crops, pesticides, the war in Iraq — and the bee experts methodically shot down each one. &quot;Yes, it's disconcerting,&quot; they'd say, &quot;But it's happened in the past, long before this particular [chemical / technology / front in the global war on terror] existed.&quot; They also said that there's no apparent correlation between affected colonies' proximity to developed areas, and that even bees that operate solely on organic crops have been afflicted. When the bees leave their colonies they abandon the site in a hurry — other animals avoid it for a while, too, even if there's still honey present. The experts seemed to feel that a fungus, parasite or other natural pest was probably to blame. It's happened before and the bees have recovered.</p>
<p>So let's all calm down. The most pressing bee-related problem of this spring has been and continues to be how to get rid of the threatening, probably-Africanized ones that seem to be setting up shop at the far end of my porch. Yet on this subject, the Kos diarists have remained strangely silent. Priorities, people.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Prompted by arguing the point in comments over at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.unfogged.com/archives/week_2007_04_22.html#006670">Unfogged</a>, I managed to track down the program in question.

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>I've taken another crack at my full-text RSS script, polishing it up for a release over at <a class="reference external" href="http://labs.echoditto.com">EchoDitto Labs</a>, and in the process I finally got around to adding a much-needed feature: letting users kill excess HTML with regular expressions. This isn't a feature for the non-geeky, but it only takes a single nerd a few minutes to work out the necessary expressions and share them with the class. The result is cleaner functionality: the algorithm used to leave some feeds with duplicate titles, comments, or other cruft. This allows you to strip them out automatically. As a side effect, your RSS reader stop thinking that old posts are new just because another dope added a comment calling for impeachment hearings.</p>
<p>My intention is for this project to be somewhat disruptive, forcing publishers and advertisers to realize that RSS is a legitimate way for people to read a site and not just a syndicated form of advertising. And the sooner everyone gets this through their head the better: if you publish free content on the internet, you will not be able to control how people will consume it.</p>
<p>But I do recognize that in the short term it's likely to be a pain in the ass for the bloggers I like and whose bosses don't understand how to count or sell RSS impressions. So let's start off by picking on someone who deserves the headache: <a class="reference external" href="http://www.metamonkey.net/fulltextrss2/?url=http://michellemalkin.com/index.xml&amp;regex=%2F%3C%21%5C-%5C-%5Cs%2A%3D%7B5%2C%7D.%2A%24%2Fsmi">here's a full text feed for Michelle Malkin</a>. It uses the new regex functionality to chop off the &quot;digg this post&quot; junk that would otherwise be at the bottom of every entry.</p>
<p>The way to use this new feature is pretty simple: pass URL-encoded regexes as GET parameters named &quot;/regex\d*/i&quot; (if you're going to use this, that made sense to you). Have at it, fellow geeks. I'll get things rolling and suggest the del.icio.us tag &quot;<a class="reference external" href="http://del.icio.us/search/?fr=del_icio_us&amp;p=fulltextrss&amp;type=all">fulltextrss</a>&quot; for the fruits of your labors.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE FOR REGEX AUTHORS:</strong> Looks like PHP's magic quotes and/or URL encoding are screwing up the use of the + character in regexes. D'oh. I'll have to see what I can do to fix that. In the meantime, both * and {} seem to work. For now just use {1,} as a substitute and you should be okay.</p>

<p>This is the second goddamn time, earning it the coveted title of the worst PHP software I've encountered that isn't also a Wordpress plugin. Enough already; it's gone. JP recently pointed me toward the decidedly more reputable-seeming <a class="reference external" href="http://www.phpsurveyor.org/">PHPSurveyor</a> this week, so I guess I'll be working on a DCist template for that.</p>
<p>Fortunately the jerk in question didn't do a very thorough job of trashing my site: he just killed the files in directories off the top level (sparing my blog, inexplicably) and put up some triumphal pages expressing his disapproval of US/Israeli foreign policy. Even more fortunately, my host has a backup from the 15th that they're pulling for me for $15. For those of you using the full text RSS script, sorry — it was one of the victims. A new &amp; improved version will be available soon at a different location anyway, though, so just sit tight for now.</p>
<p>And hey, you know the saying: God doesn't close a metasploit session without opening an interesting LUG thread. So I've got big things planned: a nightly backup to my own RAIDed SVN repository that in turn backs itself up to Amazon S3. It'll be great.</p>

But there may also be other giant robots of differing ideologies in this movie. I don't want to tip my hand.</p>
<p>Found via <a class="reference external" href="http://dansdata.blogsome.com/2007/04/19/if-you-download-only-one-157mb-avi-file-today/">Dan's Data</a> — he's got links to the original, full-resolution version. It's an amateur effort put together by a group of Italian CG artists (hence the occasionally laughable voice-acting).</p>
<p>Mostly this is just awesome. But I can't resist the opportunity to use a giant Nazi robot as a pretense for pontification — namely, about the capacity for entertainment produced by hobbyists to compete directly with the stuff made by professionals. I've argued <a class="reference external" href="/2007/01/31/its-all-just-bits/">this point</a> in the past, but have generally met with some skepticism about its capacity to apply to movies. I like to cite the fan-produced movie <a class="reference external" href="http://www.panicstruckpro.com/revelations/">Star Wars: Revelations</a> when I make this case. It's undeniably impressive from a technical perspective, but its lousy acting is an admitted sticking point for my larger argument.</p>
<p>This clip (&quot;Code Guardian&quot;) suffers from the same problems as SW:R — it looks pretty good, but the voice acting is lousy and the script, to the extent that there is one, couldn't be called remarkable. Still, I think this is a temporary problem. Perhaps it's my own prejudices showing, but I think there's a higher barrier to producing passable CG work than there is to producing a passable action/adventure screenplay or voiceover. Becoming adept at any of these tasks requires a lot of practice and/or talent, but only one discipline requires specialized tools and training. So in a way it's surprising to see the more technical disciplines become the first to succeed at producing high-quality hobbyist entertainment. But in another way it isn't surprising at all.</p>
<p>People participate in free software endeavors for a lot of reasons, but prestige and social interaction surely rank high on the list. The nature of the internet facilitates the free exchange of information, and the nature of technical disciplines results in heavy internet use by those who practice them. That makes the net a good place to for CG artists to compete for prestige and participate in communities like <a class="reference external" href="http://www.worth1000.com/">Worth1000</a>. Other, less wired professions — like, say, voiceover actors — haven't started generating and giving away online content in the same way.</p>
<p>But I think that's just a temporary problem — nerdiness is not a prerequisite for participation in these communities. Bands are an obvious example of a creative class that's thoroughly adopted the internet despite not making a living by sitting in front of a computer. The net's power as a promotional tool brought musicians online, and now there's a ton of free, professional-quality music available from non-professionals — and not all of it is being used as a promotional mechanism (look at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.songfight.org/">Song Fight</a> for a good, community-inspired example of music creation). Similarly, the graphics, documentation and internationalization of the average medium-to-large open source project are hugely better than they were just a few years ago. Or look at Wikipedia, where a prestige economy has led a swarm of hobbyist writers and editors to competitively product encyclopedia articles, of all things.</p>
<p>The actors and screenwriters haven't yet arrived in force, but I think they will. The net's simply too good of a promotional tool for them not to. When they do they'll build communities, and before you know it they'll be contributing to just-for-fun projects, too. I have a hard time imagining that as the accessibility of technology and the prestige of online interaction inevitably increase, the gap between professional and hobbyist endeavors won't continue to shrink.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> One of Matt's commenters brought up <a class="reference external" href="http://rvb.roosterteeth.com/home.php">Red Vs. Blue</a>. Of course! It's a perfect example of the other side of the coin: writers in search of technologists. In this case, they had a script but no CG geeks. They got around the problem by using the Halo engine to make <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machinima">machinima</a> (and, as the series progressed, grew in their own technical sophistication). If people like the RvB writers teamed up with people like the Code Guardian creators, they might end up with a pretty impressive product.</p>

                    <p>First, a discussion of <a class="reference external" href="http://neurophilosophy.wordpress.com/2007/04/16/diagnosing-dostoyevskys-epilepsy/">Dostoyevsky's epilepsy</a>. I haven't got much to add; it's interesting stuff, though.</p>
<p>Second, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.spectrum.ieee.org/apr07/4982/1">this article on Numenta</a>, the brain-like computing startup from one of the guys behind Palm and Treo. I'd read <a class="reference external" href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/15.03/hawkins.html">this Wired article</a> on the startup a little while ago. What they're doing is interesting, and I'm sure they've got some very smart people working for them. But in both articles Hawkins takes pains to poo-poo neural networks as a failed AI technology, and to distance his own &quot;HTMs&quot; from them. Yet after reading the descriptions of his technology (and the training and parameter-tuning it requires) and accounts of the sorts of tasks that HTMs can perform, the tech sounds a <em>lot</em> like multilayer <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron">perceptrons</a>. The dog-identifying tasks he points to are really just a more advanced case of the sorts of problems they had us solve in Intro to Neural Networks.</p>
<p>I'm all for moving beginner toolkits out of Matlab and into the open source world — I'm excited about Numenta, and hope it does well. But there's no reason to put down the accomplishments of those who came before you when what you're doing seems to be a variation on the techniques they pioneered.</p>

The author seems to think that Comcast dumping consumers who use a very large amount of bandwidth is an example of the non-neutral net in action, and then argues that neutrality == piracy OMG!!!</p>
<p>It's pretty lame. Net neutrality isn't about making people pay for the amount of bandwidth they use. It's about degrading the quality of service in a way that favors one business over another. Pretending that the two are the same is like arguing that because I can order as much food as I want in a restaurant, I should also be able to pay to make other customers' portions smaller or their waiters surlier. There have been a lot of attempts to confuse people in this manner, but this has got to be among the weakest.</p>
<p>Besides, there are plenty of ways to get on Comcast's bad side without joining the pirate hordes — try running the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.joost.com/">Joost</a> beta on a few machines for a month and see if it doesn't earn you an angry letter or two. Or try running through a few dozen Linux distros to find one that suits you. I bet Comcast wouldn't like that one bit.</p>
<p>Incidentally, the reason people justifiably hate Comcast's bandwidth caps isn't because they're anti-neutral — it's because Comcast won't tell its customers what the caps are. There's no hard limit set. Comcast just sends scary letters to the top X% of users every month, then terminates their contracts if they don't move themselves into the meaty part of the curve by the next bill. Upgrading to business service is a way around this, of course. But it's not priced for consumers (its cost reflects expected tax benefits as well as uptime, throughput and support guarantees that aren't relevant to the consumer market). Consequently it isn't a particularly viable option for most people, and they're left wondering whether Comcast is going to decide to drag its hungrier customers away from a buffet line that had been advertised as all-you-can-eat.</p>

<p>This graffiti may not seem very remarkable. But in a town where every other beer comes in a pint glass with an Eagles logo on it, and any group of three or more adults can be counted on to eventually disrupt the parade/checkout line/funeral they're attending with a chant of &quot;E-A-G-L-E-S EAGLES!!!&quot;, it's kind of noteworthy.</p>
<p>Also, note the stray mark between the N and S in &quot;Redskins&quot;. That's presumably the point at which the artist was dragged away from the wall and beaten to death.</p>

You might look at these pictures (particularly the ones near the bottom) and think that it was a special performance for an unusually large festival show. Nope. It all looks pretty much like what they did when I saw 'em at 9:30.</p>

<p>I saw the first two as I exercised at the gym.

                    <p>I've been holed up, building <a class="reference external" href="http://labs.echoditto.com/projects/sunlight">this</a> for the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.sunlightfoundation.com/mashup">Sunlight Foundation Mashup Contest</a>. My academically-minded friends will no doubt be horrified by the imprecision of the visualization — I'm really supposed to have done this by building a proper similarity tree, in which joined nodes become collapsed into their average. Those joined pieces are then treated as single nodes and everything is recomputed relative to them; repeat until every node has been added.</p>
<p>But that would've been hard! And I'd already written my algorithm. Nevertheless, thanks to <a class="reference external" href="http://bayes.wordpress.com">son1</a> for pointing me in some interesting directions.</p>
<p>You should also head over to <a class="reference external" href="http://blog.toneland.net/node/212">Tim's</a> — he's got an entry for the Sunlight contest, too, as well as a cool 2008 Presidential aggregator that he wrote with <a class="reference external" href="http://www.strangebirdlabs.com">Rich</a> (an improved version of which is coming soon to a glossy Washington-centered magazine near you). He's also written some smart Holovaty-ish thoughts on the the overlapping future of programming and journalism. To wit: hey, reporters! It's time to learn XML, regular expressions, some statistics and WWW::Mechanize (or an equivalent web-scraping package). I'm serious. The tools will get easier, but they're already accessible and applicable enough that you could greatly benefit from learning to use them.</p>
<p>Speaking of Mr. Holovaty, Adrian's busy these days <a class="reference external" href="http://www.radicalbehavior.com/5-question-interview-with-twitter-developer-alex-payne/#comment-125">getting my friends into trouble</a>, so he's <a class="reference external" href="http://www.holovaty.com/blog/archive/2007/03/08/2108">on the lookout</a> for a programmer-journalist at Washingtonpost.com to share the load. Sounds like it'd be a pretty cool job.</p>

                    <p>Potbelly, 2:30ish. I'm standing in line, having just ordered a delicious turkey-on-wheat, when I spotted an older gentleman in line behind me. He was wearing a pinstripe suit, a blue shirt with a white collar, and a yellow tie. His gray hair was gelled into a short, relatively tasteful euromullet. And he was carrying <em>not only</em> a copy of &quot;Who's Who In Real Estate&quot; — surely one of the most vacuous possible incarnations of a shamelessly vacuous line of scam-books — but also what I can only call a scepter. I guess it could've served as a cane, but the black shaft looked a little insubstantial. And the brass head was spherical in a distinctly uncanelike way. Also, he wasn't using it to walk — it was just tucked into the crook of his arm along with the book.</p>
<p>I don't really know what else to say about him. Have you ever seen somebody and instantly known that they were the X-iest example of X that you've ever seen, but still been unable to solve for X? I don't know what sort of world he'd just come from, but I've got a feeling I should be grateful that it only intersects with my own in sandwich shops.</p>

                    <p>I thought I'd love this software; everyone else does. And the UI <em>is</em> pretty good. But it keeps forgetting my entry-sorting preferences; it gets confused if I have identically-named feeds with different URLs; and it seems to be updating erratically, suddenly finding old posts that I know have been online for a few days. There's no way that this many different RSS feeds that I'm subscribed to have simultaneously become screwed up in the last couple of days — it's got to be the reader.</p>
<p>But that's just an irritating recent issue. Far worse is a long-term but difficult-to-spot bug I've been having wherein NNW occasionally loses a feed entirely, transmuting it into a clone of another one. After an initial honeymoon I'm being forced to conclude that this program can't even perform its core function. It kinda blows, and I'm surprised to have so many problems with a well-established program. I guess paying for software was a bad idea after all.</p>
