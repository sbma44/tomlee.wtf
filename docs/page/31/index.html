                    <p>Kevin Drum <a class="reference external" href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2008_06/013966.php">writes a bit</a> about John McCain's proposal of a $300 million prize for developing a new battery technology for electric cars. What this makes me really wish is that Marie had a blog, because, as a chemical engineer who just received her PhD working on fuel cell catalysts, this is right up her alley. I hope that she or <a class="reference external" href="http://jeffnye.org">Jeff</a> will pop up in comments and say smart things. And be kind if I say anything dumb.</p>
<p>But at the least I should be able to avoid saying anything as dumb as McCain's battery-prize proposal. Not that I don't like batteries, mind you! But if someone were to invent a better one they'd already be poised to make a huge amount of money through its commercialization. Offering prizes for innovation isn't always a terrible idea — for pharmaceuticals with a limited market of potential users it can make sense due to the huge costs associated with developing and testing a new drug. But <em>everyone</em> in the developed world needs better energy storage technology, and they need it right now. And while it's important to make sure your new batteries are safe and robust (e.g. they don't explode <em>too</em> much), that's still much easier and cheaper to do than it is to conduct a set of double-blind human trials. So sweetening the pot is unnecessary. Anyone who has a good idea about how to build a better battery is already working on the problem.</p>
<p>The other thing to mention is that Drum's concern over lithium is probably misplaced. Lithium's great, and a ringer when it comes to batteries. A cell's energy density is largely determined by the electrical potential between its anode and cathode — the bigger the gap between them, the better. And as you can see from <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_of_standard_electrode_potentials">this chart</a>, electrode potentials don't get much more negative than lithium.</p>
<p>But it's got its problems, too. Lithium wasn't incorporated into mass-market batteries for a long time because of its tendency to catch on fire when exposed to air or charged too quickly. And lithium batteries still tend to dramatically lose capacity about 18 months after they roll off the assembly line, mostly without regard to how hard they've been used. Both of those problems have and continue to be addressed by brilliant electrochemists, and the lithium polymer batteries we use today are fairly miraculous. But it would probably be a mistake to think that lithium technology will get dramatically better than it currently is.</p>
<p>It's also worth noting that not all hybrid or electric cars use lithium batteries. In fact, I don't think many currently do at all — the Prius uses nickel-metal-hydride, a less efficient but longer-lived chemistry. It would just be too expensive to replace the batteries on lithium's lifecycle. So worries about peak lithium should be tempered with the realization that we can make batteries out of other stuff, too.</p>
<p>But that doesn't mean we don't need a better battery. No-combustion vehicles are where everyone agrees we need to go, but they have much more significant battery requirements than hybrids. They have to charge and discharge faster and more completely, both of which are tough on batteries. And they need to provide more total power, too.</p>
<p>Right now the problem looks pretty tough. There are two promising technologies, though. First, nanotechnology and the unbelievably vast electrode surface areas it provides are making ultracapacitors look more and more viable. These devices will never be able to store as much charge as a battery, I don't think, but they can be charged and discharged very quickly and may not suffer the age-related effects that plague chemical cells. From what I've read, they also tend to be built out of less environmentally objectionable materials. As I said, this is no battery replacement, but it may make different kinds of vehicles possible — say, one that's inductively recharged every few miles by a plate embedded in the road. Or they may just replace the battery's buffering function in hybrids, and ease the charge/discharge speed problem in EVs.</p>
<p>The other technology is, of course, fuel cells. Marie tells me they're again falling out of favor, funding-wise, as their recent renaissance falls back in line with a century-long track record of failure to reduce cost and fragility. But it seems inevitable that we'll have to revisit the technology — there's just no better way to safely store lots of energy in a vehicle than with hydrocarbons or some other hydrogen-donating chemical system (I've heard some sort of ammonia pellet system suggested, too). And if you're going to store your energy as hydrocarbons (which isn't to say it has to be pumped out of the ground, of course), fuel cells are the most efficient way to turn it back into usable power.</p>
<p>That's my understanding of the situation, anyway. Hybrids seem likely to stick around for longer than many people suspect, I think. Electric vehicles may be great for getting around towns, but I think people are going to balk the first time they try to use the A/C and realize just how many watt-hours they're spending, and how few they have with them on board their petroleum-free car.</p>

                    <p>It was a busy weekend, one filled with baseball-watching, party attendance, delicious kitchen adventures, <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zack_and_wiki">videogame</a> <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassin%27s_creed">acquisition</a> and a screening of the better part of <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D.E.B.S._(2004_film)">D.E.B.S.</a> thanks to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.logoonline.com/">Logo</a> (they're sexy female high-school-aged assassins who can't be stopped — except, perhaps, by the charms of equally sexy arch-villainess Lucy Diamond). But along the way I also managed to conquer my technical problem du jour: getting transparent proxying with URL rewriting working under OpenWRT.</p>
<p>Those interested can read about the associated trials and tribulations <a class="reference external" href="http://labs.echoditto.com/proxy-based-mischief-with-openwrt">here</a> — it proved to be a just-tough-enough nut to crack. Those not interested can <a class="reference external" href="http://ex-parrot.com/~pete/upside-down-ternet.html">click here</a> and scroll down to see how this particular technical configuration can be put to mildly hilarious ends. All in all a pretty satisfying experience, and one that's left me considerably less intimidated and more impressed with <a class="reference external" href="http://openwrt.org">OpenWRT</a> than I expected to be. One weekend is about the right amount of time for a geeky challenge.</p>

                    <p>The Wii Twilight Princess hack (which I wrote about <a class="reference external" href="/2008/03/18/smash/">here</a>) was killed by the system's most recent update, received this week by all Wiis connected to the internet.</p>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="http://hackmii.com/2008/06/june-16-wii-update/">industrious hackers</a> of the net have already figured out a workaround, though. Apparently Nintendo's fix is targeted to Twilight Princess, and scans for the specific corrupted save files that enable the hack. That's already an encouraging sign — there are almost certainly similar vulnerabilities in other games, and if Nintendo is tackling the problem in this piecemeal approach it means that the homebrew scene is unlikely to ever be thwarted for long.</p>
<p>But the specifics of the update are even more cheer-inducing: <a class="reference external" href="http://hackmii.com/2008/06/wii-menu-tp-hack-killer-analysis/">apparently there are some bugs in the update code</a> which, when exploited in tandem, make it possible to continue using the TP hack. Hurrah!</p>
<p>All of this is comes from <a class="reference external" href="http://hackmii.com">hackmii.com</a> (via <a class="reference external" href="http://hackaday.com">Hack a Day</a> — yes, again), which seems to be home to some of the web's foremost Wii reverse engineers.</p>

                    <p>I've been thinking of something like <a class="reference external" href="http://jnhasty.com/embrace/">this</a> for <a class="reference external" href="/2007/06/15/beat-me-to-it/">a while now</a>. And I'd still like to build it — but maybe not one this big. A Hall Effect sensor, cellphone vibration unit and glove should just about do it, I think (although given my general ineptitude I'll have to integrate a microcontroller, I imagine). The main holdup is an unwillingness to commit to buying the parts — I'm not sure what kind of Hall sensor I need, and they turn out not to be as inexpensive as I'd thought.</p>
<p>Besides, I've got another project slowly coming together. But perhaps I'll bug the Dorkbot guys for advice once I'm done with that. In the meantime, it's great to see more of these things actually being built.</p>

                    <p>Via <a class="reference external" href="http://outtamindouttasite.typepad.com">Catherine</a> comes <a class="reference external" href="http://dc.mybikelane.com/">MyBikeLane</a>, an effort to document (with license plate annotation!) drivers' lack of respect for bicycle lanes. This is a subject dear to my heart as, during my twice-daily commute through <a class="reference external" href="http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&amp;ll=38.905428,-77.031112&amp;spn=0.004266,0.009538&amp;z=17">Thomas Circle</a>, I often keep myself bitter/amused by pondering how unimaginable it would be for a driver to be ticketed for violating the space defined by the bike lane.</p>
<p>Thomas Circle is a hotbed of bike lane atrocities. Putting such a lane on the outer edge of a traffic circle is a bad idea to begin with: you're inviting cyclists passing through the circle to cut directly in front of vehicles leaving it. Without the bike lane those cyclists would presumably join the regular flow of traffic, making them a lot more likely to be noticed by drivers.</p>
<p>But it's not just a problem of design. Drivers have no respect for the lanes, and unless they've noticed a biker in sight are all too happy to drift into them, whether from wanting to turn less sharply, a desire to pass stopped traffic or simple carelessness. Fair enough — I'd be looking for a shortcut if I was stuck on 14th at rush hour, too. But given drivers' general awfulness at noticing bikes, there really can be no middle ground: they need to stay completely out of what few lanes we've been given.</p>
<p>Perhaps most mystifyingly, a hotel located on the Southern edge of the circle has helped itself to ten feet or so of the bike lane, setting up white traffic cones in it, presumably to save themselves a spot for their valet service or something similar. Bad enough that they feel entitled to do this — but white? The color of every miscellaneous marking on the road? A color perfectly suited to blending into the gray background noise of the street? Who would make a traffic cone white?! An idiot, that's who. I don't know about anyone else, but I've already creamed one of those asinine cones, thankfully without injuring myself in the process. Next time it happens I'm taking the goddamn cone home with me.</p>

                    <p><a class="reference external" href="http://kaysteiger.blogspot.com/2008/06/name-changes.html">Marriage-induced name changes</a>! Everyone's blogging about it, so allow me to briefly chime in with my brilliant, completely foolproof solution to the problem. First, everyone keeps their name when they get married. That seems kind of obvious. Second, male children take the father's last name and female children take the mother's last name.</p>
<p>In this way each parent gets to preserve their family name, giving it to offspring of the gender that said parent secretly believes to rule (at least relative to the inescapable truth that the other sex droolz). Yet nobody has to mess around with hyphens! And, as an added bonus, if the practice ever became popular we'd soon have distinctly female and distinctly male surnames, which I think would be sort of neat.</p>
<p>More practically, of course, less-than-total adoption means that this would disadvantage female names. But that's all the more reason to embrace and fiercely espouse my crackpot idea immediately!</p>
<p><strong>WHOOPS:</strong> How heteronormative of me! Obviously this wouldn't work for same-sex couples. In that case, I suggest alternating kid-by-kid, with first dibs going to the winner of an American Gladiators-style obstacle course. Or, failing that, rock-paper-scissors (3 out of 5).</p>

<p>Matt <a class="reference external" href="http://matthewyglesias.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/06/segway_boom.php">mentioned electric bikes</a> in passing yesterday; as it happens, Hack-a-day had a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.hackaday.com/2008/06/16/electric-recumbent-bicycles/">roundup of electric recumbent projects the same day</a>.</p>
<p>I can't say that I really want an electric bike — they tend to look dumb, and are heavy besides. And I just don't need one, frankly — my legs are more efficient, require less expensive upkeep and are filled with fewer toxic chemicals than EV bikes.</p>
<p>But I do occasionally daydream about a bike with regenerative braking. Partly this is stupid: if you're paying for a drivetrain and motor you might as well go whole-hog and build a complete electric bike. But it's at least a little bit defensible: by designing a system solely meant to capture energy and then release it as a from-a-dead-start acceleration boost, you may be able to lower the requirements for the motor. Certainly your energy-storage requirements would be diminished — no bulky batteries! An array of (admittedly expensive) <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultracapacitor">ultracapacitors</a> could likely do the trick.</p>
<p>Some <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ativsolutions.com/cblog/index.php?/archives/24-Regenerative-Braking.html">actual EV bike manufacturers</a> have crunched the numbers on regenerative braking and concluded that it's a bad deal. But they did so assuming a chemical battery; ultracaps don't have the same slow-recharge limitations, and are considerably more efficient besides.</p>
<p>It may seem like a pretty trivial thing, but I think this could actually make a big difference for cyclists' comfort and safety. When you've been biking for a while you begin to appreciate just how precious momentum is, and how irritating it is to be forced to abandon it due to a motorist's trepidation or inattention. This leads to a lot dangerous behavior — when observing a stop sign comes at the cost of sweat and burning muscles rather than a penny's worth of gasoline, it's tempting to try to make sure things are safe enough and then proceed without pausing. If I could get even half of my momentum back after being forced to stop I'd be a lot happier about pulling the brake lever. It'd let me avoid downshifting when I stop, too.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> The Halfbakery folks <a class="reference external" href="http://www.halfbakery.com/idea/Regenerative_20Brake_20Bike">considered the same idea</a> a while ago using mechanical systems — hydraulic, pneumatic and spring-based. It sounds sort of promising! It's a bit more dangerous than an electric system, but would probably be somewhat cheaper and much more efficient. Unfortunately I know basically nothing about mechanical engineering, so there's not much more I can say about these systems besides noting that they sound cool.</p>

                    <p>Matt <a class="reference external" href="http://matthewyglesias.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/06/the_internet_destroyed_my_mind.php">links</a> to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200807/google">Nicholas Carr</a> expressing concern over the diminishing length of the texts he consumes. Is the internet killing our collective attention span? C'mon, sing along if you know the words.</p>
<p>Well, as Matt says, probably yes, in the aggregate. That's probably okay, though. It's easier to consume stuff, there's more of it to consume, and so we're going to adopt strategies and purchasing criteria that maximize our opportunities. But this won't come exclusively at the cost of intellectual depth — there's plenty of fat to be trimmed. Books and albums are typically somewhat padded in order to make consumers feel that they're getting their money's worth. As the digital age makes media cheaper (and physical delivery methods less relevant), that concern will diminish. More novellas, short films that actually succeed, mass-market EPs, nonfiction books that top out at 150 pages. That's all sounds fine by me.</p>
<p>But the larger point I want to make speaks to what Matt says at the end of his post: on an individual level it's not clear to me that this progression is a steady or irreversible one. Matt says he's meticulously rereading <em>The Brothers Karamazov</em>, despite a level of online immersion that should have left him unable to finish sentences, much less books. For my part, I'm currently reading a lot more novels and long-form articles than I have since I was being graded on it.</p>
<p>Part of this is about getting older. But a big part of it is also about a cycle of getting bored with the internet, which I believe to be an underappreciated phenomenon. I think there's an <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infradian_rhythm">infradian rhythm</a> to internet use — a repeating cycle of enthusiasm, engagement and consumption; boredom, disillusionment and retreat. The period of this cycle is different for everyone, and depends on their age, professional situation, technological sophistication and who knows how many other factors. In itself this is not so different from waxing and waning enthusiasm for any other pursuit. But, crucially, for a large proportion of online citizens/proponents, these rhythms were more-or-less synchronized at the beginning of this decade, during a time marked by (if not causally related to) the explosion of blogging.</p>
<p>That synchronicity led to a lot of shared enthusiasm, unsustainable cordiality and utopian dreaming. Now our cycles are drifting ever further out of sync, sometimes in waves and sometimes individually. This leads to reflections like <a class="reference external" href="http://www.outsidethebeltway.com/archives/2008/06/blogs_then_and_now/">James Joyner's much-blogged observations about the changing nature of the political blogosphere</a>, and to more meetings where people like me shift uncomfortably in their seats as junior associates suggest that creating a Facebook application for a client will change everything, man.</p>
<p>Of course it's important for people like myself, who (at the moment) feel a little burned out on the net, to realize that their lack of enthusiasm isn't necessarily more rational or sophisticated than the alternative. There's a tendency to complain:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">&quot;The internet was supposed to change everything, man.&quot;</div>
<div class="line">&quot;It <em>did</em> change everything. It is.&quot;</div>
<div class="line">&quot;Yeah, I guess. So what?&quot;</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>But that's self-evidently dumb. Those heady early days are gone, but their collapse was inevitable. A roiling convection of enthusiasm and burn-out is probably healthier, ultimately. For those of us drifting back to the bottom of the pot, the only solution is to read some books and unillustrated articles in badly laid-out magazines (the sorts that one could never explicitly name as being badly laid-out, lest one invite lengthy, godawful discussions of typography). The people riding the upward current will handle building widgets and integrating with social networks and reading everything via RSS for a while; I'm confident we'll rejoin or replace them soon enough.</p>

My favorite part:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">A very condensed version of copyright history could look like this: texts (1800), works (1900), tools (2000). Originally the law was designed to regulate the use of one machine only: the printing press. It concerned the reproduction of texts, printed matter, without interfering with their subsequent uses. Roughly around 1900, however, copyright law was drastically extended to cover works, independent of any specific medium. This opened up the field for collective rights management organizations, which since have been setting fixed prices on performance and broadcasting licenses. Under their direction, very specific copyright customs developed for each new medium: cinema, gramophone, radio, and so forth. This differentiation was undermined by the emergence of the Internet, and since about the year 2000 copyright law has been pushed in a new direction, regulating access to tools in a way much more arbitrary than anyone in the pre-digital age could have imagined.</div>
<div class="line">...</div>
<div class="line">For regulations like these to be effective, it is necessary also to censor the sharing of skills that potentially can be useful for coding illegal software. The circle of prohibition grows still larger: Acoustic fingerprinting technologies, which have nothing copyright-infringing to them, but which can be used for the same feared identification of individual tracks, must probably also be restricted.</div>
<div class="line">This domino effect captures the essence of copyright maximalism: Every broken regulation brings a cry for at least one new regulation even more sweepingly worded than the last. Copyright law in the 21st century tends to be less concerned about concrete cases of infringement, and more about criminalizing entire technologies because of their potential uses.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>I like the texts/works/tools breakdown, but I suspect this last phase is mostly a temporary blip rather than a fundamental legislative shift. The content industry, increasingly cognizant of the inescapable technological truths Fleischer details, is thrashing around like a robot moaning &quot;DOES NOT COMPUTE&quot; over a logical paradox. The DMCA and WIPO's efforts to ban &quot;circumvention devices&quot; no longer seem to me to be a credible long-term threat. For one thing, noteworthy political opposition has mobilized in response. For another, such regulations pose a real danger to technological advancement, and thereby corporate bottom lines. If a legislative battle is between the media companies and private citizens, the media companies are a pretty safe bet. If it's between the media companies and a score of other industries, the odds shift — and I think that's exactly what has begun to happen.</p>
<p>Or maybe my optimism is just born of boredom over endlessly reviewing the same inescapable logic. At this point it's clear: the only way we're going to return to a scarcity-based market for mass-appeal IP is if there's some sort of global cataclysm. Which I'm not ruling out! (But which most sane people do.)</p>
<p>Failing that, I agree with pretty much all of Fleischer's points — except for the one about Google. I know the people behind the Pirate Bay (with which Fleischer is affiliated) don't think what they're doing is criminal. But from their choice of name — and Fleischer's essay — it's clear that they understand the confrontational, norm-busting nature of their work. They're unapologetic revolutionaries, whereas Google makes a good-faith effort to play by the rules. That's a real difference from both a legal and PR standpoint. It's dishonest to the point of counterproductivity to pretend that it's all the same.</p>
<p>Anyway, from what I can infer from the Cato website, <a class="reference external" href="http://angryblog.org">Tim</a> will have a response up later this week, which I'm looking forward to.</p>

                    <p>I'm in the market for a sport.</p>
<p>It used to be that I stayed in pretty good shape by going to the gym a hell of a lot. In college I'd make it four or five days a week — an undergraduate schedule and a lack of real hobbies besides binge drinking made this relatively easy. But as I've gotten older I've been spending more and more of my time sick*, traveling, tired, working late or complaining about my knees. My post-work gym attendance has fallen off to about once a week (generously), and I'm increasingly unable to fool myself into thinking this will change.</p>
<p>Charles' boxing and yoga adventures have been an inspiration, too, and I think he's right when he says that I need to change up my routine. My short term goal is to find something I can do outside on weekends that'll actually get my heart rate up.</p>
<p>My longer term goal is more important, though: I want to find an activity that puts me on the path to one day being able to play the crazy old coot: the sinewy codger whose tanned hide hangs off his shoulders like a chieftain's furs, and who takes no greater pleasure in life than embarrassing the callow, pudgy fratboys who show up at his mountain/river/field, unaware that they are about to witness geriatric feats of strength and finesse.</p>
<p>It's ambitious, I know. But I think it's doable. My first thoughts are rock climbing and kayaking. I'm terrible at climbing, but know I enjoy it. I've done a lot of whitewater stuff, but never kayaking. The former seems a little cheaper, but right now I'm leaning toward the latter. Although the Potomac is disgusting, and climbing will probably lead to a more satisfyingly leathery payoff. So it's tough to say.</p>
<p>Anyway, I'd be glad to hear any suggestions from you, good people of the internet. All I know is that I don't want to be one of the weird old guys at the Y** who compete in endless handball ladders.</p>
<p>* This includes now. Yes, I'm sick again.</p>
<p>** Ask me sometime about the guy who either has Tourette's or listens to too much WTEM</p>

<li><strong>McDonald's &quot;Southern Style&quot; Chicken Sandwich</strong> As the commercial points out, this is less a fried chicken and pickle sandwich than an ascendant generation's rallying cry. These people have different habits — and tastes! And they're <em>not</em> going to submit to the tyranny of traditional breakfast, old man. Also, the chicken is juicy and perfectly seasoned, two points which I'm mentioning in an entirely ordinary, conversational way.
I wanted to reach out to the screen and plaintively tell these hip young sandwich consumers that I, too, have eaten chicken for breakfast. I understand! Oh god, take me with you! But their faces would have been no less implacable had they been in the room instead of on the screen. My time is over. I must go into the West, and diminish.</li>
<li><strong>Liberty/Freedom/Independence Disposable Catheters:</strong> DID YOU KNOW that a recent Medicare decision means that you no longer have to suffer with reusable catheters? I sure was sick of the tedious boiling and sterile procedure associated with my reusable catheters. But it was hard for a comparatively sexy, somewhat vivacious catheter user like myself to find time to call. Finally, my mother (STILL ALIVE) convinced me. Boy, am I glad I did! The folks at Liberty/Freedom/Independence were so friendly (YOU WILL BE LESS ALONE), and now I have much more time for my active lifestyle, pictured here (GINGERLY BENDING DOWN TO PET CAT). I use Liberty/Freedom/Independence every time I &quot;cath&quot;! (EW)</li>
