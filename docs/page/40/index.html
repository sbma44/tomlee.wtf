                    <p><a class="reference external" href="http://matthewyglesias.theatlantic.com/archives/2007/10/dreams_of_alexander_hamilton.php">Matt</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://ezraklein.typepad.com/blog/2007/10/the-why-is-not-.html">Ezra</a> are discussing pragmatic justifications for progressive taxation, aka WEALTH TRANSFER OMG. Will Wilkinson breaks things down <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cato-at-liberty.org/2007/10/12/why-the-mechanisms-of-inequality-matter/">here</a>, and his reading seems about right to me: Matt and Ezra are gunning for maximizing well-being rather than cosmic justice. Will's probably also right about it not being a very good idea to make this argument to the public.</p>
<p>But this struck me as wrong, or at least unfair:</p>
<blockquote>
But surely Matt understands that the inability of utilitarianism to acknowledge principled constraints on the way people may use one another is the main reason why most moral philosophers believe utilitarianism to be false. Perhaps Matt thinks these philosophers confused. But if so, then they share their confusion with most Americans, who also donâ€™t believe utility maximization is a good justification for the appropriation of their property.</blockquote>
<p>Sure, hardline utilitarianism is unappealing. But I doubt that Ezra or Matt actually believe in it. <em>Rule</em> utilitarianism works just fine, and lets us simultaneously accommodate the public's intuition that A) they should be able to go under anesthesia without having their organs harvested and B) there's a fuzzily-defined and slight but real inverse relationship between wealth and property rights — i.e. it's okay to take a few extra hot sauce packets from Taco Bell for later use. And isn't accordance with intuition what the validity of a philosophical system is all about?</p>
<p>Of course, this standpoint is still pretty paternalistic. To which I can only respond: meh.</p>

                    <p>Matt <a class="reference external" href="http://matthewyglesias.theatlantic.com/archives/2007/10/the_blog_of_knowledge.php">weighs in on DIY fruit harvesting</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
Kay Steiger, who went on the apple-picking trip Sara (pictured above, at the orchard) organized last weekend and that I attended under the time-honored principle &quot;go apple-picking when your girlfriend tells you to,&quot; retorts that apple picking's not inefficient, it's &quot;a form of entertainment.&quot; This would be a lot more convincing were agricultural labor entertaining. In reality, these are the jobs Americans won't do.</blockquote>
<p>But while Matt (and, one suspects, professional apple pickers) thinks it's silly to pay to perform this sort of labor — even if just with time — he's guilty of doing the same thing. Sure, he's a professional pundit <em>now</em>. But for a long time Matt belonged to the class of folks offering electronic ruminations for free — a practice that leaves a lot of professional writers scratching their heads. It's still not unusual to read a curmudgeonly journalist complaining about these damn kids writing without compensation. And while Matt may have done it as an investment in his future, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.dailykos.com/section/Diary">not everyone does</a>.</p>
<p>But writing and gardening are both at least conceivable as leisure activities. An even more astounding example of the reach of this phenomenon comes from <a class="reference external" href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/2007/10/08">Penny Arcade</a>, via <a class="reference external" href="http://bayes.wordpress.com/2007/10/08/brain-in-a-vatsim/">Quantum of a Wantum</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
There are a bunch of people in their basements playing Flight Simulator, and a bunch of people in their basements pretending to be air traffic controllers, running an application that simulates a radarscope. All wearing USB headsets, they are connected to a big network called VATSIM where they talk to each other and simulate realistic air traffic procedures as accurately as possible.</blockquote>
<p>It's strange but true! These people labor over hour-long preflight checklists, pore over FAA manuals and file flight plans before launching their virtual jumbo jets into the virtual sky and then sitting patiently as autopilot sends them across the virtual Atlantic. They create imaginary airlines and imaginary regulatory agencies. It sounds incredibly tedious to me, but I'm sure they genuinely love it.</p>
<p>Of course, crowdsourced air traffic control is probably a somewhat less practical idea than user-generated fruit harvests. But it's not hard to conceive of situations where that sort of energy and enthusiasm for tedium could be harnessed. And it's undeniable that a lot of people are expending considerable effort online creating genuine wealth without direct compensation. Some of this is being harnessed and even occasionally rewarded — open source software's sponsorship by big businesses like IBM and Novell is a good example. And various ventures are now trying to capitalize on the potential of crowdsourcing and UGC, with varying levels of success. But in many more cases it seems to be enough for authors to simply be allowed to create — so long as they continue to receive a sort of involuntary patronage from their regular employers.</p>
<p>In the past you could prove your mettle and gain entry to an industry via skillful amateur efforts, freely offered. The internet now makes it possible for those amateur efforts to actually compete with the industry they're emulating. One can't help but wonder if it's a race to the bottom: do your real job less efficiently to free up time for your fake job. Meanwhile, your willingness to do your fake job for free reduces the compensation available for doing that sort of work, making it harder to actually become a professional. The first movers will be fine, but eventually their fields will be bled dry.</p>
<p>But this is a pretty depressing perspective, and not at all in keeping with my general internet triumphalism. Explanations why I'm wrong will be welcomed with open arms.</p>
<p><strong>OH YEAH!</strong> I nearly forgot: I wrote about related issues in somewhat rosier terms <a class="reference external" href="/2007/04/20/giant-nazi-robots/">a while ago</a>.</p>

                    <p>Ryan, in a manner deeply unbecoming an economist, is <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ryanavent.com/blog/?p=525">questioning</a> the need for continued human progress:</p>
<blockquote>
I remember when men would shave with tools, real tools, that doubled as farm implements or at least good kitchen cutlery. And when we wanted a bracing splash of aftershave, well, thatâ€™s what the tumbler of scotch was for. All right, so I donâ€™t remember that, but I do remember when the two blade disposable you got in your freshman welcome pack was sufficient to hold things down until that study abroad trip junior year when you first tried growing a beard. Rust builds character, my friends.</blockquote>
<p>I'm sure this sentiment is heartfelt. But I can't help but note that both Ryan and certain other <a class="reference external" href="http://pygmalioninablanket.blogspot.com/2007/10/blood-tracks-water.html">razor traditionalists</a> can plausibly be described as Aryan Supermen. I'm sure it's very convenient to have the sort of blond, wispy facial hair that can be removed with gentle abrasion from, say, a disposable plastic dish scrubber. And I don't mean to disparage my own more problematic stubble — men like Kriston and myself find rough facial hair useful in a variety of situations, e.g. igniting a strike-anywhere match and using it, with cupped palms, to light a hand-rolled cigarette as we stare flintily at the loneliness of the great Western range. From horseback.</p>
<p>It's just that taming that sort of beard — some might call it the sort of beard that tamed America — requires more decisive, even violent measures. That's all.</p>
<p>Speaking of beards, here's a shot I took this morning before shaving:</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/1525538125/"><img alt="the october protobeard" class="center" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2129/1525538125_3dc59fe809.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: 375px;" /></a></p>
<p>As you can see, it still sucks. But I'm happy to say that this is only about five days' growth — reaching this point took much less time and involved much less discomfort than doing so has <a class="reference external" href="http://www.zunta.org/blog/archives/2006/01/02/personal_failur/index.php">in the past</a>. Like everything else in this increasingly globalized world, my beard's crappiness remains constant, but its cost is plummeting.</p>

                    <p>I am pleased to announce that I've recently upgraded my shaving technology. Before this I was using a red Mach3 Turbo that my mother gave to me, which worked well enough. Prior to that I was using a Mach3, which was indistinguishable from its successor except for a lack of redness and failure to incorporate the word &quot;turbo&quot; into its name. Also, it seemed slower.</p>
<p>But I'm now the proud owner of a Gillette Fusion PHANTOM, the most advanced piece of face-grooming technology yet wrought by man. It contains a motor, a microchip, and, at last count, SIX blades. From the name I infer that it also possesses some sort of Active Stealth technology.</p>
<p>As astounding as this all is, it's true that the PHANTOM is an evolutionary product as much as a revolutionary one. The motor, for instance, is not new: the Gillette M3 POWER was the first razor to leverage the key &quot;let's make the user's hand shake&quot; insight. But that was the rare technology for which I was not keen to become an early adopter.</p>
<p>And yes, I know what you're thinking. You're going to send me a link to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.theonion.com/content/node/33930">this</a> Onion article. Ha-ha. Very funny, you goddamn Luddite. If it was up to people like you we'd still be scraping our faces with oyster shells, squatting in the mud and waiting for the day when hyperintelligent bees conquer the earth. No thank you.</p>
<p>If you want to escape the prison of your anti-scientific prejudices, I highly recommend that you visit the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.gillettefusion.com/us/">educational website that Gillette has established</a>. There you can explore the futuristic lab where Gillette razorologists continue to probe the furthest reaches of beard physics. Your virtual guide will be the brilliant and surprisingly slutty Dr. Cassandra. Her come-ons become more intense with each click of the mouse, as Gillette's computers note your continued attention and furiously recalculate the likelihood that you can be fooled into buying a razor on the off chance that doing so will lead to sexual intercourse with a Flash animation.</p>
<p>Things really get crazy once you enter the Holosphere. I won't say anything more, except to encourage you to exercise caution: as with any holo-technology, there is always a small but real chance of cowboys, Nazis and/or literary villains escaping from the simulation and running amok.</p>
<p>I'll leave you with this sample of the high-quality educational resource that awaits you. Who are you to resist?</p>

                    <p>Yesterday I read Brian Doherty <a class="reference external" href="http://www.reason.com/blog/show/122765.html">claiming</a> that Radiohead's pay-what-you-want scheme for their new album would undercut piracy and thought &quot;Not so fast!&quot; In my experience folks will upload any content that's even marginally relevant to a site. I've certainly seem freely-available content redistributed through pirate channels before.</p>

<p>But in this case he may actually be right. Oink doesn't have it, although I suppose that makes some sense given that downloading an album from Oink comes at a cost (users have to maintain an upload/download ratio to keep their access to the site). But Isohunt hasn't got <em>In Rainbows</em> either. Huh.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> <a class="reference external" href="http://strangebirdlabs.com/">Rich</a> pointed out in comments that the band's preselling the downloads, but that nobody's actually got the files yet. That makes sense, and I feel dumb for not realizing that was how the whole thing was supposed to work. So: torrents in t-minus eight days!</p>

                    <p>Two other things occurred to me about that bird-supplied <a class="reference external" href="http://www.senate.gov/~govt-aff/index.cfm?Fuseaction=Hearings.Detail&amp;HearingID=441">testimony before the Senate</a>, so I'll share them quickly and then return to hi-tech frivolity. Apologies in advance for seeming to presume that I know things about terrorism; clearly, I don't. I do know things about the internet, though.</p>
<p>And that's the first thing that struck me: how typically internetty it all is. The networks as described in <a class="reference external" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/16/AR2005111602120.html">Michael Doran</a>'s testimony sound very much like other illicit online networks.</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">At any given moment in any given language, only a limited number of sites post original material produced directly by terrorist organizations or by religious authorities to whom the organizations have pledged loyalty. The majority of terrorist websites in operation are either mirrored versions of these existing sites or simply bulletin boards that disseminate material that originated on the websites under the direct control of the terrorist organizations.</div>
<div class="line">...</div>
<div class="line">Well, these are websites that are controlled by people who are known to each other and they will post authoritative information on the website and then it will be disseminated out by loyalists all across the Internet.</div>
<div class="line">On these bulletin boards — these are bulletin boards where they're password protected — certain individuals, their user names will become known as authoritative individuals.</div>
<div class="line">I'll give you an example. There was this American Johnson who was kidnapped in Saudi Arabia and killed. Within hours of his kidnapping, his wallet with his ID appeared — a photo of it — appeared on this website.</div>
<div class="line">So from an event like that, you can then conclude that that website is directly connected to the kidnappers and it's an authoritative website.</div>
<div class="line">Then an individual on that website, whenever an al Qaeda-related event would take place would tell you, if you want to see our statement about that event, go to the following address and then you go to that address. Once it's out there and authenticated, then it just spreads like wildfire.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>If you haven't, go read Jeff Howe's excellent &quot;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.01/topsite.html">The Shadow Internet</a>&quot; over at Wired. It describes the surprisingly centralized system that powers nearly all online piracy. There's a collection of &quot;topsites&quot; operating as a darknet — one that's known and accessible only to trusted individuals. Release groups compete within the topsites to see who can provide the best software fastest. From there the releases trickle into increasingly public places on the net: private bittorrent trackers, usenet, and finally public P2P networks. The same sort of tiered content distribution system seems to underpin terrorist website economy.</p>
<p>They're similar in other ways, too:</p>
<blockquote>
Jihadis — they compete for membership. They don't all like each other. It's not a monolithic organization that everyone supports everyone. They are discrediting and de-legitimizing their competitors online.</blockquote>
<p>This all sounds very familiar. It seems plausible to me that the same dynamic emerges in both cases: an ecosystem of poseurs, parasites and a very few elite operators who can provide the original content that powers the scene. These individuals arrange and rearrange themselves into groups that compete for prestige.</p>
<p>If this analogy is valid, the good news would be that the majority of people involved are hapless, subliterate, and totally useless to the purpose of the scene with which they've associated themselves. Getting groups to pick fights with one another would be relatively easy, and targeting elite users could yield large benefits. Check out how many pirated releases one user (or group of users assuming a single identity) named <a class="reference external" href="http://isohunt.com/torrents/?ihq=aXXo">aXXo</a> is responsible for, for instance. For all of our internet-powered talk of network effects, it's still the case that particular individuals can have an outsize effect.</p>
<p>But this analogy would bring bad news, too. Elite members of the piracy scene do what they do purely for the prestige that comes with it, and so are not prone to rationally responding to the risks and rewards introduced by law enforcement. They typically don't make any money from piracy — that's frowned upon — but they persist at their secret hobby despite the years or decades of jail time they face if caught. You'll occasionally hear a Marxist accounting of their pasttime, but it seems that in most cases that's merely a self-serving justification for their prestige-seeking behavior. It's tempting to see parallels between this and the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/04/28/AR2005042801315.html">apparently not-all-that-devout 9/11 hijackers</a>.</p>
<p>There's another analogy that became apparent to me, too, relating to how the government plans to assess and interdict these groups. The vast majority of online interest in jihad must come to nothing — like punk rock's endorsement of anarchy or hipster use of communist iconography, it's just a standard under which disaffected teenagers can unite. I've had a site <a class="reference external" href="/2007/04/22/nabopoll-is-terrible-software-dont-use-it/">vandalized</a> with anti-American/anti-Israel rhetoric before, for instance, but I think it'd be a stretch to call it a political act. And it would clearly be a colossal waste of resources for the IDF or US military to track down the perpetrator.</p>
<p>So what threat do these sites actually pose? Here's Mr. Doran again:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">The Internet is also a useful tool for recruitment. In addition to other social influences, potential recruits are flooded with propaganda, training manuals, and religious justification for joining the jihad via the Internet.</div>
<div class="line">It is difficult to say how much direct recruitment takes place on the Web. While it is likely that direct invitations to take party in terrorist organizations are usually delivered face to face, there is no doubt that the Web plays an important role in indoctrinating recruits before they are drawn in directly. Probably for this reason, extremist will not attempt to recruit overtly for violent action, but will instead legitimate the actions of terrorists and encourage readers to support the jihad however they can.</div>
<div class="line">Terrorist websites, chat rooms, and other forums make use of the Internet for fundraising. These websites often use the argument that every Muslim has a duty to support jihad but that participation on the ground is not required of everyone. The appeal for financial support alone is a method of permitting an individual to feel that they have done their duty as a Muslim but do not need to change their life in order to join the actual fight.</div>
<div class="line">Terrorist use of the Internet also includes operational training. Would-be terrorists can find training information in the use of small arms, mortars, rockets and artillery, guidance on where to fire at U.S . military vehicles in order to inflict the greatest damage, sniper training and detailed instructions about the construction of improvised explosive devices, suicide vests, et cetera. Training is also available for guidance on how, when and where to cross the borders of Iraq to join the jihad and how to avoid detection as a jihadist.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>So it's difficult to quantify the specific damage being done by these sites — we know there's fundraising, but don't have numbers for it (or at least none impressive enough to present to a Senate committee). We know that the sites probably lower the cost of recruitment for terrorist groups, but can't say by how much or whether the supply of offline recruits is sufficiently constrained for it to make much of a difference. And we know that some training information is available online, but don't know whether this is actually used to perpetrate violence or whether it's more akin to the ASCII copy of the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchist%27s_Cookbook">Anarchist Cookbook</a> that my friends and I nervously <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xmodem">XMODEMed</a> to one another in middle school and then never, ever used.</p>
<p>In short, we know these sites are bad but can't say exactly <em>how</em> bad (although if this was a budget hearing the answer would probably be &quot;very&quot;). What are we going to do about it?</p>
<blockquote>
We've got to do everything we can as quickly as we can to disrupt their websites when appropriate and necessary and compete with them for the attention of those who frequent their sites. We need to monitor their sites constantly for information and use them to exploit the visions among different sects and factions. And we need to recruit trolls who can sew seeds of doubt in the different extremists' websites and chat rooms. Obviously in the end, we need to develop the ability to shut down these sites when they represent an actual danger to us.</blockquote>
<p>And here's <a class="reference external" href="http://www.healthsystem.virginia.edu/internet/ciag/who_we_are/steering_committee/cilluffo.cfm">Frank Cilluffo</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
&quot;Honey pots&quot; offer one way to achieve these goals. Among other things, they could allow us to better understand how local political grievances may become appropriated by the larger extremist movement, which in turn could help us drive wedges and blast open existing fault lines between and among factions.</blockquote>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.bigchampagne.com/">Monitoring</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.afterdawn.com/news/archive/3101.cfm">poisoning</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.zeropaid.com/news/8877/Gotcha!+New+MPAA+Site+Tries+to+Trick+Users+into+Illegally+Downloading+Movies">honeypots</a>, and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.chillingeffects.org/">takedowns</a>. Sound familiar? It's what the media companies have been doing to fight piracy.</p>
<p>As you know, the results of that effort have been fairly dismal. It's true that the media companies have increased the effort and risk associated with downloading pirated content, but not by much — the return on their investment in services from firms like MediaDefender and Overpeer can't be very good.</p>
<p>It's hard to say how things would shake out when targeting extremist websites. On the one hand the effort seems likely to be much more expensive: the exchange of information on these sites must be predominantly legal, requiring more detailed scrutiny in order to find actionable offenses. And there are technical considerations that make it easier to automate catching P2P users than it is to catch visitors to a given website.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it seems likely that we could allocate more money for saving American soldiers' lives than we have for saving American executives' lifestyles. The scope (if not the implications) of iSlamofascism is smaller than that of piracy, too, and seems likely to stay that way: hopefully, deep down, the average human enjoys watching Bittorrented episodes of <em>Lost</em> more than they enjoy killing their fellow man.</p>
<p>Still, it seems likely to be an expensive effort that produces limited results against a threat that may not actually be all that threatening. As with piracy, the online problem seems likely to abate when the underlying condition is resolved: people don't like paying for mandatory content distribution systems that they don't need, and they like Western meddling in the Middle East even less.</p>
<p>The internet makes communication very cheap — but that's all it does. This lowers some of our enemies' costs. We can re-raise them, but it'll be expensive to do so. And given that the online extremist phenomenon seems to be primarily symptomatic in nature, I think it'd probably be a mistake to divert too many resources to fighting it.</p>

                    <p>In response to my last post a much-better-informed little birdy sent me a transcript of a Homeland Security Committee hearing about online Islamic extremism. It was an interesting read, and I may say something else about it later. But for now, here's the part that was most immediately striking:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">In an effort to raise its</div>
<div class="line">visibility and recruit new members... an Iraqi</div>
<div class="line">insurgent group held a website design contest open to anyone in the world with</div>
<div class="line">an Internet connection. And what was the prize given to the winner of that contest? The opportunity to launch a rocket attack against American forces in Iraq with just the click of</div>
<div class="line">the mouse from the winner's computer.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>It's inhuman and morally outrageous, yes. But <em>man</em>, that's a pretty good idea for an online contest. If you could just tone down the evil you might really have something there.</p>

                    <p>Has anyone written up the l33t hax0r implications of the Petraeus Report? I've been patiently waiting for someone take up the gauntlet ever since the general included this line in his prepared statement before congress:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Finally, in recognition of the fact that this war is not only being fought</div>
<div class="line">on the ground in Iraq but also in cyberspace, [my recommendations to the Join Chiefs note] the need to contest the enemyâ€™s</div>
<div class="line">growing use of that important medium to spread extremism.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>I first heard this on the radio, and it seemed a little weird to me. Not because I doubt the existence of insurgent-run websites filled with flash video of roadside bombs, LOLcatted stills from <a class="reference external" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0829459/">A Mighty Heart</a> and comment threads filled with &quot;INSURGENCY FTW!!&quot;, &quot;ANBAR SUX0Rz&quot; and unflattering analogizing of Sunni Islam to the Playstation 3. I'm sure those sites are out there. I can even believe that they serve a significant recruiting function for people who do genuinely bad, genuinely non-virtual things.</p>
<p>But it was a bit odd to hear a military commander say that, in addition to the attention we're paying to people getting shot and blown up, we also need to spend more time dicking around on the internet, presumably countering the nasty internet trouble made by our enemies. For one thing, suppressing online content does not have a particularly storied history. Given that, it seems like the intelligence value of these sites would probably outweigh the utility to be gained by shutting them down. DMCAing the Mahdi Army's MySpace page would just shut down a marginal source of propaganda. Why bother? It'd be far better to just quietly keep an eye on their top 8 (who is this shady &quot;CamGirl69&quot; character, anyway?).</p>
<p>For another thing, I have a hard time believing that the issue requires more attention. As far as I can tell there's no shortage of government funds for boondoggles aimed at preventing Kim Jong-Il from interfering with Americans' Facebook feeds. I trust that there are already people paying close attention to these issues.</p>
<p>But who knows? The internet refuses to tell me anything, so I'm left to wonder why General Petraeus thought that cyber-warfare deserved relatively prominent billing. You've failed me yet again, mainstream media! Was there some analysis of this initiative that I missed, or did the entire punditocracy inexplicably decide that there were more important aspects of Petraeuspalooza for them to attend to?</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>I realize that many <a class="reference external" href="http://www.tvsquad.com/2007/09/24/six-creeps-id-rather-date-than-vh1s-mystery/">already have</a>, but I think we need to talk about Mystery. I only became aware of the guy recently, as he unexpectedly began appearing on various TV shows that play in the background of my usual late night routine (which usually consists of fervently trying to load ROMs onto something or other).</p>
<p>I guess that Mystery's gotten himself a publicist and is making the rounds. I realize that in my own small way I'm playing into his hands by writing this. But I can't help it. He's just so awful.</p>
<p>He's also the host of a reality show on VH1 that's devoted to teaching guys how to pick up girls. Mystery is a pick-up artist, you see — the world's greatest, apparently, although it seems difficult to find solid metrics about this sort of thing. He's tall and not bad looking, although his wardrobe makes it instantly obvious that at some point in the past Pam Anderson and Tommy Lee had a garage sale. He paints his fingernails black. He used to be a magician.</p>
<p>I have to confess that I've never seen his VH1 show. I also haven't read Neil Strauss's book <em>The Game</em>, in which I'm told Mystery plays a prominent role (as you all know, I refuse to read any books that aren't about wizards). I'm speaking from a position of blessed ignorance.</p>
<p>But I have visited <a class="reference external" href="http://www.venusianarts.com/sl/va/VenusianArts.aspx">Mystery's website</a>, which he runs with a guy called Matador. &quot;Wait a minute,&quot; you may be saying, &quot;I'm beginning to think that these guys aren't using their real names!&quot; Right you are, my sharp-witted reader! It seems that people in Mystery's line of work like to use pseudonyms — like bloggers, except with venereal disease instead of comment spam. For example, the coauthors of Mystery's book include Lovedrop, Style, Sinn, Wilder, and Toecutter (Style is Neil Strauss). My favorite is <a class="reference external" href="http://www.thundercatseductionlair.com/2007/09/mystery-and-gre.html">Thundercat</a>, who I found while googling in support of this post (bonus: he describes a Daily Show &quot;sketch&quot; as &quot;chick humor&quot;). Mystery was well-prepared for pseudonymity, having already <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_%28venusian_artist%29#Biography">legally inserted</a> an unnecessary &quot;Von&quot; into his name in his early twenties.</p>
<p>Back to the website. It's pretty sad. Not because there are 473 of 500 backstage passes available for the next seminar, or even because it's running on a Microsoft webserver. No, it's the testimonial video. You really need to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcEo_HTKGFA">see it for yourself</a>, but for those unable to watch at work, allow me to summarize.</p>
<p>Three former students of Matador recount their experience at the &quot;backstage&quot; portion of a seminar. It's instantly clear how these men have been instructed to make their appearance more appealing to the opposite sex.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line"><img alt="some poor sucker" class="center" src="/static/2007/09/26/mystery_1.jpg" style="width: 422px; height: 317px;" /></div>
</div>
<p>&quot;You! The paunchy guy! Bleach some of your hair! Think 'guy who runs the sound board at a Fallout Boy show' — that's what we're going for.&quot;</p>
<p><img alt="image1" class="center" src="/static/2007/09/26/mystery_2.jpg" style="width: 422px; height: 317px;" /></p>
<p>&quot;You! Yes, the gentleman who looks unnervingly like the older brother of Tom's friends Jon and Mark. Your look will be 'the neck'. Girls love necks — they practically insist on them! You want to direct as much attention as possible to the area between your clavicles. Go!&quot;</p>
<p><img alt="image2" class="center" src="/static/2007/09/26/mystery_3.jpg" style="width: 422px; height: 317px;" /></p>
<p>&quot;As for you... well, uh. Hmm. How about you just try to appear in silhouette as much as possible? That might work, right?&quot;</p>
<p>Just listen to these poor dopes talk about the experience. It's all about how great Matador was at performing &quot;sets&quot; and &quot;going caveman&quot;. Yes, it sounds like Matador is awfully good at adhering to the principles of the system he invented to describe the things that he does. Similarly, I'm currently in the twenty-seventh year of a record-defying game of TomBall.</p>
<p>None of the gentlemen pictured above mention the girls that they've gotten as a result of paying $4000 to cretins. That, they presumably presume, will come later. It's a bad presumption, though (theirs, not mine — my presumption is fine). For one thing, these seminars seem likely to attract the least-promising students available. It's like those real estate seminars you see advertised late at night on channels that required the use of the second, clickier TV knob back when you where a kid. While it's true that some people make a lot of money at real estate speculation, it's also true that paying someone thousands of dollars to tell you that you should staple some signs to utility poles is not an effective way to gain admission to the plutocracy.</p>
<p>But the bigger problem is the lack of focus. For a bunch of guys desperate to improve their luck with the ladies, these three sure seem to have hard-ons for their greasy instructor. It's understandable: talking to strangers while wearing strange new clothes is hard. It would be much easier if you were less insecure — and surely someone who's enough of a jackass to call himself &quot;Matador&quot; must be comfortable in his own artificially-tanned skin. The goal gets shifted: before they know it they're simply trying to continue hanging out with a more dominant male, and paying to do so.</p>
<p>It's all right there on the website. Just check out Mystery's personal guarantee:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">&quot;If you are at all dissatisfied with my Training program, after you have fully attended all three days, I insist that you approach me on Sunday night, after the training is over.</div>
<div class="line">&quot;You can do so discreetly; I will not embarrass or expose you in front of other students — remember, you're family now.</div>
<div class="line">&quot;Explain to me the nature of your concern, and I will personally see to it that it will be addressed by me or my staff, as quickly as humanly possible.</div>
<div class="line">&quot;Should I still be unable to provide the value that you expect from me, I will gladly and promptly refund your attendance fees, including the (normally non-refundable) deposit.</div>
<div class="line">&quot;And guess what? We'll still stay friends. That's my commitment to you.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Hear that? Mystery — the man who's in the business of inventing ways to bypass women's agency and capacity for critical thought, reducing them to consumable objects to power his reality shows and ejaculations — respects and admires <em>you</em> as an individual. So much so, in fact, that the deep friendship forged by your commercial interaction trumps his desire to charge $4k to the Mastercard you applied for outside the campus dining hall. Even though he could buy a pretty sweet fuzzy hat with that money (and he could really use a new fuzzy hat). No, it's more important that the two of you stay friends. And seriously, as soon as his schedule frees up he'll swing by your folks' basement for that game of Halo you've been talking about. He hasn't played before, but he bets you're really good!</p>
<p>I know this, because it happened to me. During my freshman year of college I lived in a dorm suite that had a doorbell made from scrounged parts before the sun set on our first collegiate day. By the end of the semester it would also house an animatronic Tigger doll. I liked my suitemates a lot, and we all got pretty good at Starcraft. But there was no denying that the devout Christian guy was the second-coolest person among us.</p>
<p>But the first-coolest was Dave. Dave was friendly, short, and very successful with women. I hung out with Dave, and superficially tried to figure out how <em>I</em> could become the one to pull the fire alarm in the middle of the night to get my roommate out of the room, allowing me to lock the door behind myself and a coed. But soon I just mostly just trying to hang out with Dave. He was charming and self-assured, and having that all the time seemed even better than having drunken sexual encounters some of the time. But it didn't make me any more charming, or get me any more girls.</p>
<p>Ugh. I have to admit, though, that I'm kind of fascinated by this awful, awful scene. Much like when Kriston regaled the Jagermeister promotional team with the true, sordid origin of their employer's wares, I think it would be pretty fun to catch it <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seduction_community#Approaching_and_opening">in action</a> and have a chat with them about it. To McFadden's!</p>

                    <p>From the bizarre opening <a class="reference external" href="http://www.showbox.co.kr/">production company logo</a> to the moment in the climactic battle when the dragon goes through puberty, that was just about everything that one could ask for from a Korean dragon-versus-dragon movie. Along with awesome CGI and memorable catchphrases (&quot;What are you talking about?&quot;; &quot;That doesn't make any sense&quot;), it boasted the most convoluted plot in a movie of Asian provenance that I've witnessed since my third viewing of <em>Ninja Scroll</em> revealed that the elite team of ninja monsters who poisoned the village's well did so in order to manipulate gold prices in a bid to destabilize the Tokugawa Shogunate. The fiends!</p>
<p>The actual dragon-on-dragon violence occurred in a modern-day Los Angeles where Americans spend most of their time brandishing guns and familiarizing themselves with obscure aspects of Korean culture. Sommer was at the football game, so I haven't yet been able to ask whether this constitutes a creative liberty. Either way, it won't diminish the reptilian awesomeness contained in D-War. I don't know if South Korean movies make it to the north end of the DMZ, but if they do I bet Kim Jong-Il is kicking himself for trading away his nuclear ambitions. Fuel oil isn't going to do squat against an angry Imoogi desperate for Yuh Yi Joo.</p>

<p>None of this is likely to matter much to iPhone users who know how to use Bittorrent and IRC, however. If Apple got serious about the effort I could imagine users getting locked out of firmware upgrades and iTunes use (lest they lose their hacked functionality permanently).
