                    <p>Well, I'm sitting in Dulles airport. Rain fell for about ten minutes during the drive out here, and the consequences have been dire: not only is my flight delayed, but the jetway has somehow been damaged and a power surge left the display board frozen in a cruel &quot;ON TIME&quot; rictus.</p>
<p>In other words, it's a great time for complaining. But not about any of this, actually: I've got the internet, a nearby Five Guys, and a power outlet. My boss, JP, is sitting next to me, obsessively checking our flight status in a way that ensures I don't have to pay any attention to what's going on. And the other guy sitting next to me has now made three consecutive phone calls expressing his nearly-outraged incredulity regarding the type of solder and flux that a subordinate suggested using for a project (&quot;40/60?! Who does he think he is?&quot;). I think he's talking about plumbing, but I'd like to believe I have it within my heart to embrace soldering in all its many forms, so this background noise still counts as soothing.</p>
<p>No, I'm pretty well set-up here. This carping has to be backdated: it's about what happened on Sunday when Emily, Charles and I flew out of SFO. The security area wasn't crowded. Charles had gone through the metal detector, I think, and Emily and I were the only two people at the table to which we'd been assigned.</p>
<p>&quot;Excuse me, miss!&quot; said a busty, bustling TSA representative. &quot;I have a registered passenger here!&quot;</p>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Registered_Traveler">Registered Traveler</a> program, you might recall, is a fairly new initiative by which air passengers can pass through expedited security lines by paying a $100-ish yearly fee to one of several private firms that then run regular background checks. Those who enroll pass through faster lines, and eventually may be allowed to do things like keep their shoes on or their laptops in their bags. It's meant for frequent travelers, and we, the public, are assured that the fees will provide additional lines and personnel — there should be no effect on those who don't enroll.</p>
<p>This was not our experience. The young woman brought by the TSA employee was allowed to cut in front of us, and was then personally led through the security process like a blind baby kitten. That was irritating, but not a particularly large inconvenience — like I said, the lines weren't long. But there also wasn't much of a point to plopping that lady's patrician ass in front of us and escorting her through — it probably made her feel special, and us less so, but nobody was saved or cost any meaningful amount of time. Still, if this is the system they use during busy periods, it really <em>is</em> going to make air travel worse for everyone who doesn't pony up $100/year to gain entry into the program.</p>
<p>Now of course there's nothing wrong with charging more for better service. But I think there's at least a <em>little</em> something wrong when that service is a government-mandated barrier to travel, and more so when it's one powered by secret lists and standards about which appeal is nearly or completely impossible. It also seems like a bad idea to give richer — and therefore more influential — passengers a way out of a system that, without some sort of opposing pressure, will inevitably become more and more irritating and inhumane as bureaucrats try to save their jobs by figuring out up ways to prevent plots that no one can anticipate.</p>
<p>I suspect the registered traveler is doomed to descend into the kind of corruption that surrounds Russian cars' <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/17/world/europe/17moscow.html?_r=4&amp;ref=world&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin">flashing blue lights</a>, although probably in a somewhat less glaringly tacky fashion. It's an inherently elitist system administered by private interests that's granted the power to short-circuit an allegedly vital security system. How could anyone think this will end well?</p>

                    <p>You might want to go check out <a class="reference external" href="http://flickr.com/photos/ethorson/tags/jeffandmarieswedding/">Emily's first batch of photos from Jeff and Marie's wedding</a>, which include a number of shots of me looking pre-tty stupid. I seem to have lost my camera somewhere between DC and the beach — it sufficiently close to death that I can't say I'm too broken up about it — but while I wish I could supplement them, the pictures Emily took are more than enough to convey just how beautiful the wedding was.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.jeffnye.org/wedding/2008/06/survive_wedding_check.php">Marie and Jeff</a> rented a gorgeous house in the middle of a bunch of vineyards in the middle of wine country in the middle of a state that's so beautiful it seems like it must be cheating. There were a number of high notes: driving down the coast in a rented convertible; lots of delicious food, wine and beer; hours spent playing an inscrutable German board game; Jon stripping down and jumping in the pool near the end of the reception. Arguably more importantly, the bride and groom are great for each other, and have been for a while now. They seemed to actually enjoy the wedding while simultaneously making sure that their guests did, too, which seemed like a pretty impressive accomplishment.</p>
<p>All in all: a huge success. Way to go, guys.</p>

I have to admit that I'm not familiar with much of Orson Welles' body of work beyond <em>Citizen Kane</em> and his famous <em>War of the Worlds</em> broadcast. So I had assumed that there was no more complete and cruel affirmation of Welles' final, nihilistic hopelessness than his next-to-last acting credit: <a class="reference external" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092106/">the voice of Unicron in the Transformers movie</a>. But it appears that history has come up with innovative new sleights since then.</p>
<p>Within <em>F for Fake</em> there's a monologue about Chartes Cathedral in which Welles expresses the idea that our individual impermanence doesn't imply futility — that there's dignity to be had in the moment and within our collective history. It's quite beautiful.</p>
<p>Anyway, be sure to check out the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/comment_servlet?all_comments&amp;v=pUrKCUTUSPo">associated Youtube comments</a>, which together form a convincing rebuttal. I especially like the one comparing Welles' work (unfavorably) to that of Quentin Tarantino.</p>

                    <p>Some of you may have noticed that I updated my Facebook profile this morning in various ways, including the addition of an embarrassingly MySpacey profile photo (dig that soulful staring into space). Please note! I'm still not using that damn platform. I was mostly just trying to figure out how to put a note on my profile stating that I don't really use FB, and that folks should try contacting me elsewhere. Yes, I could just delete my account. But without a Facebook account many people cease to realize you exist, making detainment in secret government prisons all but certain.</p>
<p>Anyway, back to my attempts to add a note to my profile: they ended in abject failure. Which brings me to my suggestion: can somebody build a &quot;I don't really use Facebook&quot; Facebook application? Something that would display itself prominently on my profile page and respond to any messages by politely inviting the sender to email me instead?</p>
<p>I'm not trying to be a jerk, I promise. I have more or less made my peace with FB; I just don't have the time or inclination to start using it seriously, and I'm getting sick of sending notes to new online acquaintances politely explaining that it's not them, it's me.</p>

                    <p>For a moment, anyway. Beginning two Saturdays ago it was the beach in North Carolina; then it was Jeff and Marie's wedding in California; today it's Emily's birthday(!) in DC; tomorrow it's back to California for work; Friday it's the City Veins' CD release party at Iota; Saturday it's a belated birthday dinner with Emily in Philadelphia, hosted by our friends Tara and John Carlos.</p>

                    <p>Inspired by <a class="reference external" href="http://www.flight404.com/blog">Robert Hodgin</a>'s <a class="reference external" href="http://www.flight404.com/blog/?p=121">impressive work</a>, I decided I wanted to take a crack at making animations in Processing. Inspired by <a class="reference external" href="http://goodspeedupdate.com/">Rob Goodspeed</a>'s thoughtful experiments, I figured I might as well try to make it about something interesting.</p>
<p>The DC <a class="reference external" href="http://dcstat.octo.dc.gov/dcstat/site/default.asp?dcstatNav=%7C30914%7C">Office of the CTO</a> makes a lot of interesting data available, so I decided to take a crack at doing something with it. Here's my first pass: it's a visualization of every reported crime incident in 2007.</p>
<p>Blue means property crime — robbery, larceny, etc. Red means violence — assaults, murders and the like. Green means sex crimes. The color-coding is obviously less than perfect, but is at least sort of interesting. Each frame in the video represents 8 hours — one police shift. Colors gradually fade to a dark, translucent gray after two weeks' worth of time has elapsed. You can view a larger version of this video by clicking through to the movie's <a class="reference external" href="http://vimeo.com/1049199">Vimeo page</a>, and an even better-quality version by then scrolling down to the lower right for a Quicktime download link. You'll need to log in or create a Vimeo account for the Quicktime — but you should! Vimeo is the best videosharing site I've used by a mile.</p>
<p>At the moment I'm trying to figure out where I should go from this point. A few ideas:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Add graphs and a calendar display to help users see the relative levels of crime over the course of the movie</li>
<li>Identify and place a street map under the crime visualization</li>
<li>Produce a static, high-resolution render showing the differences in location of crime between 2007 and 2008 (YTD)</li>
<li>Do it all over again with the city's pothole data (also geocoded!)</li>
<li>Add a jaunty soundtrack</li>
</ol>
<p>If you have any other suggestions, please let me know. Those of you interested in the geeky details should keep an eye on <a class="reference external" href="http://labs.echoditto.com">EchoDitto Labs</a> — if I can find time I'll be posting an accounting of the tools I used over there.</p>

                    <p>Yglesias <a class="reference external" href="http://matthewyglesias.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/05/thick_moral_concepts.php">links</a> to a <a class="reference external" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Feministing/~3/295051381/009237.html">Feministing post</a> about a GOP consultantdefense of the word &quot;bitch&quot;, then discusses the difficulty of untangling the high-minded, purely pejorative nature of the insult from its sexist connotations.</p>
<p>As it happens I found myself thinking about this just the other day when, while biking, a driver cut me off. I immediately thought some unkind things, then found myself tentatively rephrasing them when I saw the driver was a woman, then found myself backing off from the effort entirely when the most obvious alternate reformulation struck me as inherently sexist.</p>
<p>To be clear, I think that justifying the application of the word &quot;bitch&quot; to Hillary Clinton, as the consultant in question is trying to do, is pretty obviously sexist — Senator Clinton seems just as amiable as the next politician, and I doubt she's ever done anything to this specific guy other than disappoint him by not having murdered Vince Foster. But in the abstract I wonder if the use of sex-specific insults is any more inherently problematic than the use of sex-specific pronouns. Obviously any such epithets will inevitably become tangled up with indefensible opinions and prejudices related to the gender with which they've been associated; but equally obviously, a truly egalitarian society will make it equally easy to spew venom at someone, regardless of their sex.</p>
<p>And, given that people will continue to get upset with one another, it seems like we're probably stuck with gendered swearwords: perhaps my capacity for creative profanity just isn't up to the task, but it seems like androgynous put-downs are inevitably stilted or lame. Whether that's because they aren't in common usage or because harsh words lose some impact when divorced from visceral, unspeakably ugly hatreds like racism and sexism, I couldn't say. Ideally it'd be the former — and on this score, the decreasing (but still significant) ridiculousness of the word &quot;frak&quot; is encouraging.</p>
<p>But I suspect that all the best insults — the single words that actually sting — will remain connected to sexist conceptions of gender roles. But we can all at least aspire to liberally apply these horrible oaths more evenly across gender lines. That's the future I'd want to live in, anyway. Call me a utopian dreamer if you must, but the next time I'm endangered by a driver I'll call them an asshole loudly, proudly, and without consideration of their sex. To do any less would betray a lack of respect for a fellow human being.</p>

<p>For a while now I've been encouraging people to jailbreak their iPhones. And for a while now I've found myself without a good answer when they ask, &quot;Why should I?&quot;</p>
<p>Thanks to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ziphone.org/">ZiPhone</a> it's not a difficult operation, but the payoff to replacing the little AT&amp;T logo with your name isn't enough to overcome the fear most people feel when they contemplate fiddling with their shiny new status symbol's brains. I think it's worth it: the Terminal app is incredibly handy if you're the sort of person who regularly has to SSH into their own laptop to manually kill a runaway process. But there aren't too many people who fit that description. Tinyproxy, which can theoretically provide emergency internet for your laptop over the phone's cell connection, is a comforting safety blanket. But of course the connection is incredibly slow, and it takes a good five minutes to complete the necessary configuration on the laptop and phone prior to each use, and it didn't work at all the last time I needed it.</p>
<p>But lo! There's finally a reason to unlock your phone that doesn't include pornographic videogames or touchscreen guitar simulations: <a class="reference external" href="http://www.intelliborn.com/">IntelliScreen</a>, which adds weather, email, calendar and other notifications to your phone's lock screen. It's pretty nice; give it a try.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>It's hard to maintain a sense of what counts as novel. I run into this all the time when trying to come up with posts for <a class="reference external" href="http://techdirt.com">TechDirt</a>: the struggle to construct an interesting perspective rather than a bland restatement of what should be obvious to any casual observer. Yet, often as not when I fail and post something that seems like a vanilla rehashing of well-trodden ground, the comments fill up with people who are confused or shocked or in violent disagreement over what I thought were settled issues.</p>
<p>Basically, I need to get out more. On the internet, I mean.</p>
<p>Or I at least need to recognize that there might be some merit to repeating myself. With that in mind, let's talk about software patents — partly because of this newfound resolution, and partly because I just can't help myself.</p>
<p>So: Matt put up a <a class="reference external" href="http://matthewyglesias.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/05/math_you_cant_use.php">post</a> pointing to Tim's <a class="reference external" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/techliberation/~3/290419187/">review</a> of <em>Math You Can't Use</em>, a book which explains why software patents are a bad idea. Yglesias's commenters are being surprisingly dense about this. Let's try this one more time:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">When ever anyone owns property (real, personal or intellectual) there are always those complain the whole system of ownership is a drag on them. They are right. They are also blind to the bigger picture. Failure to protect legitimate property interests has bigger problems, long term, in that there is no incentive of the property owner to invest and develop the property if he cannot obtain a return on his investment. It is no surprise that there is a strong relationship between protection of property rights and long term economic growth.</div>
<div class="line">Last I looked, I didnt think that those countries who had nationalized property for the &quot;national interest&quot; were doing so well, economically.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>But of course physical property transfers are zero sum. That's not true for intellectual property transfers — copies of ideas are free. Screaming &quot;commie!&quot; at a copyright reformer is incoherent and always has been.</p>
<blockquote>
[W]hat I see is that A gets a patent, B finds it inconvenient, and argues that the whole system is broken. The main argument presented by B (and friends) is that it makes life and business difficult for B.</blockquote>
<p>Well... yeah. But this is a <em>good</em> argument. Again, the glaringly obvious: the enforcement of intellectual property laws (and thereby the concept of intellectual property itself) is about costs and benefits. What cost shall we impose on society by restricting the value-generating copying of ideas in order that new ideas will remain plentiful and of high quality? We stop people from copying songs so that singers will keep singing. We stop people from copying drugs so that chemists will keep formulating. We stop people from selling counterfeit Mickey Mouse paraphenalia so that crazed fascist sympathizers will continue to dream up beloved children's characters and, one day, be able to afford to cryogenically preserve their bodies.</p>
<p>Clearly, there is an equilibrium to be sought. We need new drugs, but we do not want aspirin to cost $10 per pill. The thing is, the last few years have demonstrated that for many areas of creative endeavor we have <em>massively</em> overestimated the compensation that must be provided in order for society to continue enjoying plentiful ideas. The success of the open source movement and the continued fecundity of the music industry, for example, clearly show that we, the greedy masses, can help ourselves to considerably more free intellectual output than we'd thought without endangering the whole system. We'll all enjoy the benefits — as well as the savings to be had by not spending as many of our resources on enforcing IP laws.</p>
<p>Of course, how far this can be pushed is up for debate. Other fields — publishing, filmmaking, drug discovery — may not be as adaptable. In some cases I'm optimistic that the associated capital costs have or will fall to the point where creator compensation can be safely diminished in order to benefit us all. But now we're getting into the weeds. Clearly there ought to be a negotiation around each IP-producing field to determine whether the benefits provided by restricting the use of its output outweigh the value lost by imposing that restriction.</p>
<p>And for software patents, the situation is extraordinarily clear: it's very hard to find a software author who thinks that patents have contributed anything useful to the process of innovation. In fact, most developers think that patents have exerted a significant retarding effect. If that weren't the case — if the ideas produced and protected under the software patent system were the sorts of novel and valuable contributions that the system is designed to encourage — one might expect to have heard about them.</p>
<p>Well, which ones <em>have</em> we heard about? The three most famous, I'd say, are the Amazon 1-Click patent, which concerns users buying items with a single mouse click; the LZW patent, which involves the compression algorithm used in the GIF file format; and the Eolas patent, which is about a web browser's ability to embed other programs, like Flash movies, Java applets or ActiveX controls, into rendered webpages.</p>
<p>The first thing to realize about all of these is that they're pretty stupid. The Amazon patent is famous because it's such an obvious idea that its legal protection inspires disbelief. Perhaps more compelling is the Eolas patent. But again, the notion of having an application deputize another program to render content is pretty obvious; in fact, there was <a class="reference external" href="http://www.w3.org/2003/10/27-rogan.html">prior art</a> that many thought should have prevented the patent from being granted. It was not an idea that needed protection in order for it to spring to life.</p>
<p>But the LZW patent is probably the most emblematic. <a class="reference external" href="http://www.dspguide.com/ch27/5.htm">LZW is a compression algorithm that was granted patent protection</a>. Compuserve baked it into the GIF file format without realizing it was protected, and GIF attained widespread use. Then the owners of LZW came forward and started asking for payments. Whoops! Almost immediately the PNG format sprang into being — it turns out that LZW wasn't all that important; there were plenty of other ways to solve the problem, many of them free. But by that point GIF was baked into enough applications that for many there wasn't much choice but to knuckle under to the demand for royalties.</p>
<p>This kind of so-called &quot;submarine&quot; patent is the real threat. It's a tremendous boon to our society that a creative individual can start writing valuable software with a few hundred dollars' worth of hardware and an internet connection. Software patents add &quot;... and an attorney on retainer&quot; to that list. It's simply not possible to know if you're in violation of a patent without conducting an expensive search. And even that's no guarantee.</p>
<p>Imposing significant costs in order to subsidize things that don't need subsidizing is wasteful and dumb — particularly when the relative costs and benefits are this far out of whack.</p>

                    <p>On Saturday night Emily, Charles, Kriston, Becks and I staked out a table at Temperance Hall. And, while engaged in the larger project of noticing how much I like the bar's jukebox, I was reminded how <a class="reference external" href="http://www.zunta.org/blog/archives/2006/04/13/wolf_parade_bla/">god-damned great</a> Wolf Parade is.</p>
<p>Or how great they were, anyway. It's been a while since that album came out. In between then and now most of the attention directed to Wolf Parade has been transferred to Sunset Rubdown, the incredibly self-indulgent side project masterminded by Spencer Krug, one of the band's two founders. I did not approve.</p>
<p>WP is getting ready to finally release a new album (due to what I can only assume is a hilarious swapped-briefcase incident with the folks who run <a class="reference external" href="http://www.pancakemountain.com/">Pancake Mountain</a>, it's called <em>At Mount Zoomer</em>). And, as these things must, it's trickled onto the internet and today, finally, onto my ipod. Stereogum <a class="reference external" href="http://stereogum.com/archives/premature-evaluation/premature-evaluation-wolf-parade-at-mount-zoomer_009536.html">gave it a review</a> and liked it; I'm not so sure. It's too early to say, really — these tracks sound to my uneducated ear like a rough mix. Either that, or the production is going to fall far short of the mark set by their debut's trademark &quot;being pursued in the dark through the wreck of an abandoned spaceship&quot; timbre.</p>
<p>But even if that's fixed, I doubt these songs are going to live up to <em>Apologies to the Queen Mary</em>. I need to give it a few more listens, though.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>More cheerfully on all fronts: <a class="reference external" href="http://www.myspace.com/matesofstate">you can legally stream the forthcoming Mates of State album on MySpace</a> right now. It's short but excellent. Not as good as <em>Bring It Back</em>, maybe, but that record is one of my favorites. This new album, <em>Re-Arrange Us</em>, seems to me to be a little more emotionally one-dimensional — at least at first listen — but the band is continuing to avoid repeating itself while maintaining a beautiful pop center that somehow fails to be embarrassing. Not, of course, that I'm very good about being embarrassed by pop music, even when I probably should be.</p>

                    <p>You know I love you. But these two stories are really, really embarrassing:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=90309540">Cyber Attacks in China Target Activists, Journalists</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=90285155">Elvis, bin Laden and Hitler Join Mission to Mars</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Story A:</strong> A number of people with interests that generally or specifically oppose those of the Chinese government have received emails carrying trojan malware payloads. Some of these emails appear to be from the recipients' trusted contacts.</p>
<p>Nobody involved with the story seems to realize that a lot of email trojans replicate by opening the victim's address book and sending themselves to everyone found within. Nor is it unusual for keyloggers to be installed. As far as I can tell there is nothing linking these attacks to China — although of course there are a lot of hackers in China, and hackers frequently employ nationalist (e.g. anti-Israeli, anti-American) rhetoric when defacing websites. Again, there's no reason to believe there's a government link here.</p>
<p>If the Chinese government wanted to go after these people, they would employ more sophisticated methods. This is not a story.</p>
<p><strong>Story B:</strong> NASA is running a few different outreach programs whereby internet users can submit names or messages that will be burned to DVD and shot into space. The reporter repeatedly asks affiliated officials: &quot;What if someone includes Osama Bin Laden's name? Or Adolf Hitler's!!?&quot; Someone already has, apparently. The officials correctly respond to this by shrugging.</p>
<p>Really, NPR: what do you think is going to happen? An alien-assisted Caliphate spurred by the inclusion of our enemies' names? Who do you think is going to retrieve this DVD from the infinite emptiness, and know how to decode it, and then know what a bunch of <em>proper nouns</em> mean?</p>
<p>And if your critique has more to do with the inappropriate use of government resources, then let me ask you — what do you think the marginal cost of an extra dozen bytes on a DVD is? A hint: it's less than the cost of paying someone to vet every submission. And it's certainly less than the value of several minutes of broadcast time on public airwaves.</p>

                    <p>Slashdot <a class="reference external" href="http://hardware.slashdot.org/hardware/08/05/06/2032216.shtml">posted</a> something yesterday; today I gave it a try. Apparently the <a class="reference external" href="http://chdk.wikia.com/wiki/CHDK">CHDK project</a> allows you to supplement your Canon camera's firmware. The modified software allows you to override the rather constrained exposure times and ISO settings, and do other fun things like shoot in RAW, trigger exposures via USB, record longer movies and even set the camera up to take pictures whenever it detects motion. There are also a few less useful applications thrown in:</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/2473392789/"><img alt="playing reversi, compliments of CHDK" class="center" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3248/2473392789_48512f6896.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: 375px;" /></a></p>
<p>Reversi! Neat.</p>
<p>Installation is pretty painless: after figuring out your camera's firmware revision, you download and copy two files to the root directory of your SD card. Then boot into picture-viewing mode and go to the &quot;update firmware&quot; menu option. Despite what this sounds like, it's all reversible: by default you'll have to repeat the operation every time you turn the camera on. And even if you set it to automatically boot, you can always revert to the stock firmware by deleting the files from the memory card.</p>
<p>My geriatric SD400 is juuuust below the cutoff for official distributions, but a little searching turned up a <a class="reference external" href="http://chdk.wikia.com/wiki/SD400">beta release</a> that seems to work fine. If your camera isn't listed as being supported, use the wiki's search function.</p>
<p>I'm afraid that my camera hasn't got enough life left in it to really make good use of this new photographic freedom — the focus hasn't been great ever since some sand got into it at the beach. But knowing that these capabilities exist makes me virtually certain to buy another Canon when I finally decide to replace it.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>So! Let's talk about what I've been working on. I wasn't very good about documenting my WMATA picture frame build. This time I'm aspiring to do a better job.</p>
<p>At the moment I'm working on getting a 10x20 array of LEDs working. I haven't completely made up my mind about what I'm going to use it to display, but it'll be something that can be hung on the wall, I think. At the moment there are two parts to the project.</p>
<p>First is the array of LEDs. I'm using a sheet of pegboard for spacing; last night I began soldering them together. As you can see, I still have a lot of work ahead of me. I installed 70 LEDs last night over the course of two or three hours (admittedly, with breaks for dinner and the expression of my very important opinions regarding American Idol). That's 35% of the total number.</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/2473114747/"><img alt="miles to go..." class="center" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3276/2473114747_7ed146e1bb.jpg" style="width: 375px; height: 500px;" /></a></p>
<p>Each hole in the board has an LED, to which a resistor is attached. The anodes of every LED in a row are electrically unified; the cathodes in every column will be, too. This lets me avoid having to use 200 individual on/off connections. Instead I'll rely on persistence of vision: each row will be powered up in sequence, and during that period each column will be switched on or off. One row — ten LEDs — will be illuminated at any given instant. By flipping through rows very quickly the display will appear to be continuously on. Our retinas are stupid that way.</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/2473934182/"><img alt="closeup of the assembly" class="center" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2208/2473934182_d09f376304.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: 375px;" /></a></p>
<p>The advantage gained by this is that I only need 30 connections instead of 200. That's an improvement — much less soldering! — but still more connections than the Arduino has to offer.</p>
<p>So, to expand the available connections (which I should really be calling pins, and will be from here on out) I'll be using four daisy-chained five-bit shift registers. These are integrated circuits that require various connections — power, ground, and some others supporting optional functions that I'm not using — but the real action happens on the chips' input and clock pins. You set the input pin to a desired value; you then flip the clock pin on and off. The chip then remembers the value that was on the input pin, and begins displaying it on its first output pin. If you do the same thing, the originally-remembered value is moved to the second output pin, and the new input value takes the first position. In this way you can shift bits down the line — and by connecting one chip's final output to another's input, you can make the line arbitrarily long. Voila: as many output pins as you need, all at the cost of a mere two Arduino output pins.</p>
<p>The video below is a proof-of-concept for this commonly-used idea — it's just my effort to make sure I know what I'm doing before I start making irreversible soldered connections. The Boarduino (the thing with the blinking red light) is connected to the first shift register (the chip closest to the Boarduino), and set to send four ON signals, then four OFF signals (distinguishing the divisions between each one by flipping the clock signal, which is indicated by the flashing red LED).</p>
<p>In the actual device each shift register output will provide power to an entire row's anodes — there will only be one ON bit at a time, and it will travel down the twenty outputs in sequence. This is why there are transistors in the setup, too: the shift register could provide enough current for a single LED, but ten would be pushing it. The transistor allows a very small current from the shift register to switch on a much larger current.</p>
<p>Electronically astute readers might be asking themselves why I'm going to the trouble of attaching 200 resistors (and for my electronically non-astute readers: the resistors are necessary to keep the LEDs from consuming too much current and burning out). After all, if only ten LEDs will actually be on at a time, why not just have ten resistors — one for each column?</p>
<p>There are a couple of reasons, most of them related to a lack of confidence in my ability to keep just one row enabled, particularly during the debugging process. First, in general it's a bad idea to have LEDs sharing resistors. If one LED fails the other one may suddenly experience twice the current you had intended, and will also fail immediately. Second, the resistors are rated for a half-watt of power dissipation. Each LED consumes about 30 milliwatts; if an entire column is illuminated, that'd put me 20% over spec for the resistors. I probably could've gotten away with shared resistors in this case, but I'm still sufficiently unsure of what I'm doing that I didn't want to risk it. Besides, all that additional soldering will build character.</p>

                    <p>So where can I sign up for more timely updates from the media conspiracy? I'm imagining an email list. Or maybe a dashboard widget with Growl notifications telling me when and how to unfairly marginalize the Ron Paul campaign.</p>
<p>When I went to bed last night, MSNBC had begun expressing doubts about Senator Clinton's prospects. But that was it! By this morning the floodgates had opened and suddenly everyone is willing to acknowledge what has been true for weeks: that there's really no way for her to catch up that doesn't involve people taking to the streets. It really is striking, bizarre, and a bit frightening to see how suddenly, uniformly and arbitrarily this change occurred. The most generous interpretation is that after one or two people risked embarrassment by acknowledging the actual situation, everyone else felt free to adopt the new storyline.</p>
<p>Without the fourth estate to help it play make-believe, I guess it's unlikely that the Clinton campaign is long for this world. That's fine by me. But I'm still a little bitter: I'd gotten pretty good at writing rote, despairing <a class="reference external" href="http://dcist.com/2008/05/07/morning_roundup_252.php">morning roundup</a> introductions about the primary campaign's interminability. When I woke up this morning and rescanned the headlines I had to throw away a rather clever paragraph. Sucks!</p>
<p>So please: a little more warning next time the media conspiracy suddenly and arbitrarily shifts direction — those of us at the distant bottom of the org chart would really appreciate it. Maybe you guys could set up a Google Calendar or something.</p>
