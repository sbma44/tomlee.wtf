Amusingly, those who've jailbroken the new 2.0 firmware have had access to a copycat app since yesterday. It makes me sort of wish Apple hadn't pulled the app — now the free app won't proliferate and those eight dopes will be able to continue to enjoy showcasing their elite levels of wealth/idiocy.</p>

I suppose it ought to have been, since the Travel Channel is based in Chevy Chase. Still, it was kind of surprising to see someone do a not half-bad job representing the city. Brown herself is charming and funny, and I hear she killed Andrew Zimmern in personal combat in order to land her own show. Hell, I would've given her a show for any two of those three.</p>

<p>I've been to <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goshen_Scout_Reservation">Goshen</a> many times. My troop (and Mike's) was 647 — the fightin' 647th! — and every summer most of us would head to camp Bowman. Sitting on land originally donated by the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merriweather_Post">Post family</a>, Bowman is one of several camps surrounding Lake Merriweather on the Goshen reservation. And, if I may say so, it's the baddest-ass of them.</p>
<p>The point of all of the camps is to aid in rapid merit-badge accumulation. Earning these badges is a worthwhile pursuit since it lets you gain rank, which affords you the opportunity to boss around little kids. Normally the process involves performing some tedious task in isolation (a week's worth of pullups; wandering around a field with a compass) and then going to the home of a stranger you sort of know from church. He's all pissed off because you couldn't find his house and are late, and anyway he only signed up for this because he had to to help his own kid earn the badge. But eventually you have an awkward conversation about citizenship, he signs something, and a few weeks later your mom sews a new badge onto a sash that evokes dueling senses of embarrassment and pride.</p>
<p>The process for earning badges at Scout camp is very different. On the first day you go to each of the various stations: Orienteering! Pioneering! Aquatics! Archery! Riflery! Shotgun! Counterterrorism! Well, alright, not counterterrorism. But there are a number of awesome things that you can sign up for. And if at the end of the week you've managed not to shoot anybody or drown, you're rewarded with a pile of badges — that, and a disturbing eagerness for society's collapse, thanks to a newly-acquired suspicion that you'd excel in the state of nature (presumably on the strength of your ability to tie a proper bowline).</p>
<p>But this can be said of all the camps surrounding the lake. Bowman differentiates itself: its attendees are counted on to work together as patrols to prepare their own meals, maintain their campsites and generally do their best to forestall the descent into savagery that will inevitably have occurred by week's end.</p>
<p>A typical dinner involves picking up ingredients from the central commissary, laboriously preparing them over an open wood fire, then changing into a filthy uniform prior to sitting down to a half hour of picking specs of ash out of inedible mush. Sorrow-drowning is accomplished via powdered fruit punch mixed beyond the point of supersaturation, such that muddy pockets of crystalline sugar whirl around your mouth, barely noticeable under the burning tang of the, um, Tang. There are adult leaders present at these meals, but they typically abstain from scout-prepared food. Instead they subsist on staples purloined from the campsite's collective stores at the week's start (&quot;Almond butter? No, you're right, campers, no one would want to eat <em>that</em>...&quot;); and, in my experience, packets of Taco Bell hot sauce that they wisely smuggled in. The situation is about as dire as you'd expect.</p>
<p>The menu was usually the same from year to year, so I know exactly what caused this food poisoning: the foil packets. These hamburger concoctions were popularly referred to as &quot;Davey Crocketts&quot; in what I can only assume is a grisly reference to the Alamo. Consisting of ground beef and vegetables wrapped in aluminum foil and buried in the fire, they were a highlight of the week. Not because they were particularly good — a lump of unseasoned beef and half-cooked potatoes is not a taste sensation — but because there was no tedious cleanup required (washing dishes without running water turns out to be a huge pain in the ass). I have very little trouble believing that a ton of campers got sick from eating these half-assed culinary creations. It's a wonder it doesn't happen more often, in fact.</p>
<p>I myself got very sick one year at Goshen. Not from food, though — I think it was from inhaling some lake water. But man, I was <em>really</em> sick. Sick enough, in fact, that I was relocated to Camp Post, the administrative facility. I spent the week in bed, but I don't remember much of it. I remember that my breath was sulfurous, which seemed like a bad sign. And I remember that there was a cooler from which patients could help themselves to as many Flintstones sherbet popsicles as they'd like — being afforded this kindness seemed like a <em>very</em> bad sign. I spent my waking hours reading yellowed Casper the Ghost and Richie Rich comics and being visited by my troop's adult leaders, who, with their knee socks and Smokey-the-Bear-hats in hand, looked almost as somber as they did ridiculous.</p>
<p>But at the end of the week my parents picked me up, took me to the beach and after a night spent on the bathroom floor I was fine. I hope the scouts who got sick this summer fare as well, or at least that the quality of the comics on offer has improved.</p>
<p><strong>ALSO:</strong> The Nabob reminds me that he wrote a <a class="reference external" href="http://pygmalioninablanket.blogspot.com/2005/08/f-troop.html">similar post</a> almost exactly three years ago. Except as you might imagine his life-and-death BSA experiences had more to do with exploding shrapnel and flying axe heads than tiny, microscopic germs freemasons run the country!</p>

<p>That's right: my overpowering masculinity extends far; yea, even unto the document object model.</p>
<p>Actually, though, I think I probably got this result in a nontypical way, as my browser history currently contains no links to ESPN. The most incriminating domains on my list include <a class="reference external" href="http://jeroenwijering.com">jeroenwijering.com</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://digikey.com">digikey.com</a> and, um, <a class="reference external" href="http://washingtontimes.com">washingtontimes.com</a> (I don't read it for the articles! I swear!).</p>
<p>That, or maybe the script noticed that yesterday I read <a class="reference external" href="http://radaronline.com/exclusives/2008/08/tucker-max-responds.php">an article about Tucker Max</a>. Based on that datum alone the script should not only be able to tell that I'm male but also that I'm an asshole.</p>

                    <p>It's that time of year again: the FishbowlDC Hottest Media Types contest is upon us. And frankly, I'm a bit disappointed: due to last year's... <a class="reference external" href="http://machinist.salon.com/feature/2007/08/22/fishbowl_bots/">irregularities</a>, Patrick Gavin promised new and improved technology. And I was ready! I checked <a class="reference external" href="http://simile.mit.edu/wiki/Crowbar">Crowbar</a> out of SVN and into a virtualized environment; I created a custom screen-scraper script for it, and got it working with XulRunner in such a way that it could be called by Ruby. I started looking into firing up a farm of Amazon EC2 instances to run the operation in parallel. I hit a snag when trying to find a decent RDF parsing gem for examining Crowbar's output, but then the poll went up and I saw it didn't matter.</p>
<p>It's the same goddamn PollDaddy crap as last year! And it's still just as vulnerable to a looped one-liner shell script. Fire up Firebug to grab the AJAX call's URL, then set curl to keep loading it. You don't even need to fake your user agent.</p>
<p>Ah well. We can still have some fun with this. Thanks to <a class="reference external" href="http://arantius.com/misc/greasemonkey/script-compiler">this</a> handy GreaseMonkey script compiler I've put together a little Firefox extension that should help this year's voting arrive at the appropriate result: namely, one that puts Mr. Brian Beutler at the top.</p>
<p>For those who question the propriety of this enterprise or (gasp) Brian's hotness — well, there's probably no hope for you. But look, maybe an analogy will help: Fifty Cent got shot a bunch and it made people start acting like he can rap. Now he's a millionaire with access to unlimited supplies of Vitamin Water. A public acknowledgment of Brian's post-shooting beauty is a pittance in comparison. It's the very least we can do.</p>
<p>And it should be really easy, too. All you have to do is click the link below, say OK to whatever security warnings come up, and install the extension. I think it'll work in Firefox 2 and 3; I've only tested it in the latter, though. After it's installed and you've restarted Firefox, navigate over to the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.mediabistro.com/fishbowlDC/hottest_media_types/hottest_media_types_get_voting_male_off_air_90977.asp">appropriate page</a>. A message should pop up, then the robovoting will begin. You'll get feedback, too, and the total number of votes you've cast (and your associated rank) will be displayed as it proceeds (it should remember the total even if you stop and restart the process).</p>
<p>And if you <em>really</em> want to demonstrate your love for Brian, you can leave proof of your vote total here in comments by pasting the tiny hexadecimal garbage displayed under it (along with the vote total you're claiming) — each total has a unique code. No cheating!</p>

                    <p>Lord knows we need all the tolerable bars in DC we can get, but last night's experience is making me want to write off Townhouse Tavern. We ended up there with a larger-than-expected and somewhat unwieldy group, but arrived early and had secured chairs for everybody outside. After an hour or so one of our party went a few feet up the street to take a call. When the bartender came to clear empties he pushed the guy's chair a bit out of the way, making it look like it belonged to a different, unoccupied table.</p>
<p>Some new arrivals approached another table out front that had folks around it, and one of them grabbed the now-slightly-displaced chair. We tried to explain that it was spoken for, but the guy who had snagged it just ignored us. Emily politely tapped him on the shoulder and explained the situation again, but he continued to blow us off, not even bothering to make eye contact. One of his group found the whole thing funny, and asked us incredulously if we realized that the chair-taker owned the bar.</p>
<p>Well, hell, did he? My gullibility is well-established, but it actually seems pretty possible to me: the bartenders were hanging out with their table all night, and the guy certainly carried an attitude of entitlement sufficient to mark him as a proprietor. If so, man, what a lousy way to treat your customers. I left that place pretty pissed off, and am sorry to have had a chip placed on my shoulder about what is, like I said, one of the few endurable bars in DC.</p>
<p>I suppose when you buy a place like Townhouse a large part of your motivation is a desire to host your friends exactly how and when you want. I can understand that. But it's tough to want to put money in the pocket of someone who treats you like garbage, regardless of how nice his bartenders are. Hopefully somebody'll pipe up and tell me that no, there's no way that was the owner.</p>
<p><strong>KRISTON TO THE RESCUE:</strong> Mr. Capps, a good friend to me and Townhouse both, writes with assurances that the TH owner is considerably taller, beardier and more Scottish than the thoroughly dude-like dude who behaved so poorly toward us. Sounds like it was just a bunch of regulars with delusions of grandeur. Good.</p>

                    <p>I thought <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/03/magazine/03trolls-t.html?ei=5124&amp;en=b5085d50ee5c65e5&amp;ex=1375329600&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink&amp;pagewanted=all">this weekend's article on trolls</a> was pretty good, and that the author did a nice job balancing the need to treat his subjects respectfully against his obligation to point out that they're completely full of shit.</p>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="http://www.unfogged.com/archives/week_2008_07_27.html#009080">associated Unfogged thread</a> descended unfortunately quickly into an elucidation of who wasn't paying attention when their English class discussed <em>Crime and Punishment</em>. But prior to that everyone at least acknowledged that the activities described in the article aren't really what most people think of when they say &quot;trolling&quot;. I think that's right for a couple of reasons.</p>
<p>For one thing, I suspect that trolling as it's understood in the blogosphere is probably a lot less prevalent than people tend to think. Deliberate bad-faith argumentation is much rarer than people who just strongly disagree or are otherwise unable to engage with the conversation in a way that others find interesting. Communities have a right to avoid having the same discussions over and over, and occasionally saying &quot;don't feed the trolls&quot; is one of the few ways to accomplish that, I guess. But it always strikes me as unfortunately dishonest.</p>
<p>Of course even if the prevalence of blog trolls is overstated, the existence of griefers can't be in doubt. Just log in to a game on Xbox Live and wait to be paired with someone who spends all his time shooting teammates in the back of the head. I think that's a better, less ambiguous description of what Fortuny and Weev and the rest of the people mentioned in the article really are. The only thing that sets them apart from a MMORPG PKer is their technical sophistication and their decision to ply their trade on the web.</p>
<p>What I found most interesting, though, was the ease with which these damaged individuals are able to damage others. Although I think Weev's Malthusian spiel is grandiose bullshit, I have my own similarly gloomy predictions. Specifically, I worry about the inevitable increase of personal power. Modern societies are fundamentally reliant on growth, and technology is no exception. But of course there are certain biological, physical and mental limits that will remain fairly static even as our ability to process information, wield energy and manipulate living systems expands. That means that over time every individual will be able to exert more power over others. Those potential victims will be similarly empowered to defend themselves, of course, but the advantage of surprise and the gulf in power between the average citizen and the expert will continue to grow.</p>
<p>I usually think of this in terms of weapons: we're already at the point where a disturbed and dedicated hobbyist is able to create a device or organism that can kill a lot of people. The difficulty of this task will continue to decrease and the associated potential devastation will continue to increase. The article on trolls made me realize that this effect will hold for psychological harm inflicted by a stranger just as well as it does for physical harm. And it made me feel much gloomier about our prospects for collectively ceasing to do damage for its own sake before the stakes get catastrophically high.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Go see what <a class="reference external" href="http://meganmcardle.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/08/culture_matters_1.php">Megan has to say</a>, too:</p>
<blockquote>
I doubt that the solution is, as the author suggests, just to learn to live with it. Rather, I'd expect that countertrolls will emerge--hackers who put as much energy into harassing these people as they put into harassing us. Evolutionary biologists call people like that &quot;altruistic punishers&quot;, and they serve an invaluable purpose in any society.</blockquote>
<p>I think she's probably right. I mentioned player killers above — I didn't mention <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player_killer#Player_killer_killing">player killer killers</a>: in-game vigilantes targeting PKers that have emerged enough times and places to be recognized as a phenomenon in its own right.</p>
<p>Whether or not PKKers have ever had much of an effect on any of the online communities in which they operate, though, I couldn't say. <a class="reference external" href="http://www.doombot.com">Jason</a>?</p>

<p>This <a class="reference external" href="http://www.medpagetoday.com/MeetingCoverage/ICAD/tb/10320">Rember</a> drug that's showing promising efficacy against Alzheimer's is really pretty exciting. For a long time I've had blind faith that my generation wouldn't have to face Alzheimer's, at least not the way folks currently do. I was hopeful that the solution would arrive in time for our parents, too — now it looks like it might.</p>
<p>The story behind the drug is interesting. Naturally, <a class="reference external" href="http://pipeline.corante.com/archives/2008/07/31/rember_for_alzheimers_methylene_blues_comeback.php">Derek Lowe</a> is the place to go for an informed perspective on the matter. He (and <a class="reference external" href="http://blog.wired.com/wiredscience/2008/07/new-alzheimers.html">Wired</a>) both note that Rember is actually a very old drug: Methylene Blue, which has been used for everything from malaria to psychiatric disorders to intestinal surgery. It's got a long history and seems to be quite safe.</p>
<p>But it is very, very blue. And that leads to some side effects. From <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylene_blue">the Wikipedia article</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
Methylene blue was used at the end of the century as a successful treatment for malaria. It disappeared as an anti-malarial during the wars in Asia, as U.S. soldiers disliked its two inevitable, fully reversible side effects: green urine and blue sclera.</blockquote>
<p>Blue sclera — as in the used-to-be-whites of your eyes. So yes: grandma might remain mentally sharp, but she's going to look like she just wandered off the set of <em>Dune</em>. Awesome.</p>
<p><img alt="image1" class="center" src="/static/2008/07/31/skitched-20080731-115749.jpg" /></p>
<p>Presumably the drug can be used synergistically with the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapho_juice">Juice of Saphoo</a>.</p>

                    <p>I am on the record as being anti-Phil Collins. This puts me at odds with some good friends who have jumped wholeheartedly into the half-serious Collins renaissance that's been plaguing our great land as of late. Frankly, I'm surprised it's got legs given its likely provenance, which seems to me to clearly involve <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto:_Vice_City_soundtrack">Grand Theft Auto: Vice City</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/Radio_Episode.aspx?episode=339">This American Life</a> and/or a need to sidestep mainstream America's rededication to all things Journey. The <a class="reference external" href="http://stuffwhitepeoplelike.com/">SWPL</a>ishness of the situation is so glaring as to be embarrassing.</p>
<p>But it's not just this specific musical throwback that worries me. Even though I enjoyed Yglesias's 90s alt-rock party, I have to admit that the theme made me uneasy. I believe that as we get older the first muscles to lose tone are the ones that, when tightly clenched, produce a convincing sense of irony. Sure, listening to Silverchair might seem like a great idea <em>now</em>. But if you aren't careful, before you know it you'll be no different than your uncle who paid $120 for an obstructed view at an Eagles concert that starts at 5pm.</p>
<p>I'll admit that the alternatives are grim. But I think there's at least somewhat more dignity to be had by clinging tightly to Pitchfork's Best New Music section and copies of Paste until the whole enterprise buckles and collapses under the weight of your teenage offspring's embarrassed disavowals. Nostalgia is best left to people who've given up or are too young to have been there in the first place.</p>
<p>But I know that most people don't find this very convincing. So let me try another tack: this past weekend Emily, Scooter, Lauren, Sommer, Jeff and I were at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.philadelphiaweekly.com/view.php?id=9329">a bar</a> in Philly — one of the few where you can still smoke, and therefore one that is certifiably cool. We headed upstairs, where we found a table and some DJs. These guys seemed authentically hip: sporting horrible beards and wraithlike t-shirts, they looked like emaciated bears that had staggered out of the woods and into a Salvation Army, where they constructed poor disguises before setting off to South Philly in search of PBR specials and/or salmon. It should have been a pretty good set, in other words.</p>
<p>Instead? Marcy Playground. Excusable, perhaps, for novelty value (which for some reason seems to be synonymous with &quot;totally monotonous and unbearable&quot;). But then they followed it up with Verve Pipe's &quot;<a class="reference external" href="http://hypem.com/track/541481/Various+Artists-The+Verve+Pipe+-+The+Freshmen">The Freshman</a>&quot; and I knew we were doomed. The biggest hits from the darkest days of the 90s continued to issue from the speakers at an uncomfortable volume (to replicate the effect, turn your radio up and tune it to DC101).</p>
<p>Emily eventually saved us and, pouring on the charm, got them to turn down that dag-blasted racket — we were the only patrons in the room, so it seemed okay to ask. Despite our miraculous escape, the lesson should be clear: ironic musical nostalgia is too dangerous a force to be trusted to civilians. It can go so horribly, horribly wrong.</p>
<p>But I understand the impulse. Maybe it's inescapable. For example, I can't help but regard this as being among the most awesomely moody things I've ever seen:</p>
<p>And no, I can't tell if I mean that ironically.</p>

<blockquote>
The custom-rolled firmware from the US cellphone companies is also, of course, likely to tell fibs about signal strength. The telephony companies quickly realised that it's much cheaper to sell phones that show lots of signal all the time than to actually bother putting up more of those expensive cell towers. And, once again, the signal strength is not the same as the call quality. Lots of signal plus lots of noise is not as good as a little bit of signal plus almost no noise at all.</blockquote>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>Getting back from Philadelphia yesterday was not fun. I imagine it won't surprise anyone to hear that the Chinatown bus has been getting more and more crowded as people respond to higher gas prices. What <em>is</em> surprising is how badly the bus industry is dealing with it. Are they running more buses? No. Raising ticket prices? No. They seem not to have noticed that anything's different, in fact, despite everyone else managing to — yesterday there was even a young guy shooting footage and doing interviews for what I presume to be a short documentary about the situation.</p>
<p>And that situation is not good. Sommer, Jeff and I showed up around 4:30, intending to catch the 5:00 bus. The 4:30 was late, so we were in time for that, too (buses to DC only depart a few times during the day, but these two are scheduled close together). But a couple hundred other people were waiting, too. The two buses came, loaded and left for DC, but we weren't able to make it onto either. Nor were a lot of other people. And it was nerve-wracking: the crowd was pushing and people were fighting. The situation wasn't helped by new riders who seemed to feel they were entitled to physically bar others from boarding while their families and friends pushed up to the front of the crowd. Understandable, I guess, but dangerous.</p>
<p>At that point we decided we'd had enough and, after confirming that Greyhound wasn't running another bus anytime soon, we headed to the train station. Amtrak, at least, has responded to the increased demand: they've jacked up their fares. That at least makes it easier to avoid being crushed to death, but it's still hard to understand why bargain-basement rail travel costs six times as much as the bus. I mean, sure: infrastructure. Overhead. Better service. Relatively paltry public subsidies. But <em>six times</em>?</p>
<p>I hope that the bus companies begin to respond to the demand for this route soon. All the new players — Bolt, DC2NY, Megabus — run NYC/Philly and NYC/DC routes but, despite the NYC/DC bus assuredly passing through Philly to drop off passengers, they won't let you book a trip that doesn't include New York. As someone already prone to seething over New York City's collective solipsism, it's pretty infuriating to see half-empty buses leaving for the Big Apple on the half hour while people are risking serious injury jostling for a $15 seat to DC.</p>
