                <p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0510/36789.html">This Politico story</a> finishes solidly, but man does it ever start off badly.&nbsp; I suppose I shouldn't expect anything different, but the newspapers' obsession with an imagined era of dispassionate objectivity is now less charmingly eccentric than it is indicative of a distressing disconnection from the fundamental nature of reality.&nbsp; Anyway, <a class="reference external" href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/ezra-klein/2010/05/a_theory_of_bloggers_and_the_m.html">Ezra's take</a> is both smarter and, hopefully, will allow those truth-and-justice-believin-in newspapermen a way to mentally sidestep the dreaded question of partisanship.</p>
<p>In other MSM-bashing news: man, I had a hard time writing the <a class="reference external" href="http://dcist.com/2010/05/morning_roundup_pretty_awful_editio.php">morning roundup</a> today.&nbsp; The latest details from the UVA lacrosse player murder were clearly one of the day's most prominent stories, and I found myself trying to thread the slim gap between condemning the coverage and failing to condemn the murderer.</p>
<p>To be clear: Huguely, having reportedly confessed to the crime, can't be considered anything other than a monster.&nbsp; But I can't help but recoil at the way the Post's editors handled this story.&nbsp; I mean, take a look at <a class="reference external" href="/static/2010/05/05/cartoonish-20100505-130108.png">this</a>.&nbsp; It's cartoonish.&nbsp; If you <a class="reference external" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/05/04/AR2010050402215.html?sid=ST2010050304618">read the story</a> it's clear that the reporters were unable to turn up any really damning quotes about Huguely from anyone who actually knew him or his victim.&nbsp; So instead they hang their case for his obvious villainy on a drunken run-in with the cops where he seems to have mouthed off, then engaged in some violent behavior before or in the course of getting tasered.&nbsp; That's not the mark of a model citizen by any measure, but it's also not an outrageously unusual thing to find on a fraternity member and varsity athlete's resume.</p>
<p>The story goes to even more ridiculous lengths, actually underscoring <em>in the text</em> the disparity between the victim's lovely class photo and Huguely's bedraggled mug shot.</p>
<p>I'm not at all anxious to rehabilitate the image of a murderer.&nbsp; But I do think the Post is doing everyone a disservice by playing up this guy as some sort of transparent villain, skulking through the UVA campus until his dark and brutal nature finally, inevitably, claimed a victim.&nbsp; That sort of laughable oversimplification doesn't help anyone except those who enjoy clucking their tongues and patting themselves on the back -- as if they don't know anyone who could ever perpetrate or fall victim to domestic abuse.</p>
<p>Far more useful would&nbsp; have been an effort to tell the story that seems to be implied by the scant quotes people who actually knew the couple: that all too often people fail to anticipate these tragedies before they occur. Unfortunately, even monstrous human beings rarely appear to be the sort of villainous caricatures that sell newspapers.&nbsp; It's worth taking that idea seriously more seriously than the Post did.</p>
