                <p>Earlier tonight I tweeted something snide about &quot;Big Data.&quot; &nbsp;Some people actually replied! &nbsp;This was a useful reminder that Twitter is not just a black hole into which bile can be thrown. &nbsp;It also made me realize that I should probably explain my thinking a bit more.</p>
<p>At this point, I consider software development to be a trade. &nbsp;It's easy to pretend otherwise, what with so many of us having degrees in computer &quot;science&quot; and the fact -- often only apparent to practitioners -- that a program's implementation can reflect an aesthetic sensibility. &nbsp;But in truth those of us who work in the industry perform tasks that are a lot more like the work of an electrician or plumber than that of a sculptor or theoretical physicist. We apply a relatively small number of solutions to an almost infinite landscape of problems. &nbsp;There's still plenty of room for variation and artistry in the execution -- there's more than one way to skin a cat -- but it really is about deploying specialized tools to solve applied engineering problems.</p>
<p>Ted Dziuba once wrote something like &quot;scalability is the problem that every software engineer wishes he had, and ten actually do.&quot; &nbsp;There's something to this, but it's a bit unfair to the people who wish they had the problem. &nbsp; A run-of-the-mill web developer studying scalability is a bit like a construction carpenter studying Amish furniture making techniques. &nbsp;Is it relevant to his work? &nbsp;Well, strictly speaking, no. &nbsp;He just needs to be able to tack up frames so the drywall guys can come by. &nbsp;Still, if you're choosing which carpenter to hire to help build a townhouse, it might not be a bad idea to pick the guy who's interested in learning about dovetail joints and how to build a dresser without using any nails or screws. &nbsp;To be clear: this is not where the guy's talents are actually needed. &nbsp;He could be rebuilding houses in Haiti, or New Orleans, or wherever. &nbsp;There are plenty of problems that need his skills. &nbsp;Still, there's nothing wrong with a guy taking pride and interest in his craft.</p>
<p>And that's about where we are with software developers interested in scalability, or Big Data, or whatever. &nbsp;Interest in esoteric topics is healthy! &nbsp;It shows that a person is engaged and anxious to learn. &nbsp;A very few of those people actually will need to build dovetail joints someday. &nbsp;And yeah, they could probably just learn once the need arises. &nbsp;But it's not a particularly grievous misallocation of resources for them to learn now instead of later.</p>
<p>But things get a little dodgier once you get beyond this circle of technologist self-betterment. &nbsp;It is not particularly helpful, for instance, to start writing news stories about how the future of carpentry is the phase-out of screws, and how in the future no firm that hasn't prepared itself and its employees for the screwless economy is going to be able to compete. &nbsp;It's just not true. &nbsp;Some smart people are interested in this stuff, but that doesn't mean it's about to transform the industry.</p>
<p>So, look: Big Data. &nbsp;Do some people genuinely deal with this class of problem? &nbsp;Yes, some do. &nbsp;Many more, myself included, wish they did: I get as excited as anybody else by the idea of marshaling huge quantities of information to reach interesting conclusions! &nbsp;The problem here is really just the &quot;big&quot; part. &nbsp;Computers are <em>so</em> powerful. &nbsp;How big does a problem need to be before a single machine is an impractical solution? &nbsp;The answer is: very, very, VERY big. &nbsp;For instance, I've got the last ten years of federal spending data on the laptop on which I'm typing this. &nbsp;That's about 31 million rows of data. &nbsp;That's a lot! &nbsp;But it's still nowhere near the point where I'd need to pursue exotic optimizations for my queries. &nbsp;Most startups do not do as much business as the federal government; and most well-designed systems don't need to constantly query a huge working set of data. &nbsp;I can't help but wonder whether we'd be better off spending more time teaching each other how to run regressions, or just calculate a confidence interval (how big do you need that data to be before you can arrive at a decent answer, anyway?).</p>
<p>But this is just my own sense of the matter. &nbsp;The fact is that I don't do a ton of work in this area. &nbsp;Perhaps I'm way off-base here! &nbsp;But I kind of get the sense that engineers are getting excited about interesting things, and others are concluding that those interesting things are <em>broadly important</em> things. &nbsp;It's not always so.</p>
