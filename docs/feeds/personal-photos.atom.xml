I brought with me a tan, a briefly-broken camera, five new pounds of body fat and a profound sense of bewilderment at having &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/medildo/sets/72157600306784210/"&gt;missed my college reunion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not that I would have gone — it would have been nice to see old friends, but I wouldn't have wanted to leave my vacation early. But I'm a little miffed that I didn't heard a peep about it from UVA. I guess they don't bother keeping track of you if you don't join the alumni association — something that I refused to do, despite many lame entreaties. &amp;quot;Free Burrito Dinner!&amp;quot; they'd proclaim, &amp;quot;You just have to join the alumni association!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A delicious burrito did sound pretty good at the time. But since the deal basically amounted to $250/burrito, I declined. Admittedly, I wouldn't have had to make any payments for several years (it's the burrito interest that kills you). But the sense that someone was trying to trick me in an insultingly stupid way led me to foreswear the alumni association permanently. Hence: no reunion mailings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm much happier to have spend that time at the beach, anyway. And there are pictures! My own collection is a little truncated, both due to apathy and to sand getting into my camera partway through the trip, making it unable to focus on anything. A little zooming in and out seems to have dislodged the wayward grain, though, and everything's okay again. Here are the ones I managed to snap before that happened:&lt;/p&gt;
