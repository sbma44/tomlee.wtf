I would've been sold on the strength of the name alone; a friend's recommendation was more than enough to make me resolve to give them a listen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took me a couple of weeks, though (and an additional tweet from &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/mstem"&gt;Matt&lt;/a&gt;) before I got around to it. To be honest, I'm not sure I'm a fan of the album. I find large parts of it to be a bit boring; other parts remind me -- for reasons I can't quite identify -- of the sort of bloated, Fleetwood-Mac-ian WASH-FM rock that echoes off receptionist desks all over this town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But &amp;quot;Home&amp;quot; -- goddamn, what a song.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external" href="/mp3/Edward%20Sharpe%20and%20the%20Magnetic%20Zeros%20-%20Home.mp3"&gt;Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros – Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of things to like about it. I could've been counted as a fan on the basis of the Morricone-isms alone. And I'm a complete sucker for the female vocal, which has the sort of breathy, stretching-after-a-nap timbre that only happens when a really cute girl picks up a serious cigarette habit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But more than that, it's an amazing recorded performance between the two singers, one that evokes a genre tradition but invigorates it with a sense of utter, honest vulnerability. I haven't heard anything like it in a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If someone stuck you in a studio, said &amp;quot;We're rolling, &lt;em&gt;try to sound in love&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;, could you do it this well? I'm left completely charmed, slightly wary, and unsure whether to believe in the singers' talents or (god) their love. I may vaguely hate them for making me write that sentence, but I can't deny that the sound they make together is miraculous.&lt;/p&gt;

So let's just do this in context-free bullet point format, like the rest of our society:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Indie rock beards: done. If I, on the cusp of my fourth decade, can see this, then surely the matter was actually settled in some Pitchfork staff listserv months ago. Capps has already accidentally stumbled into the vanguard. And now, in the blinding, beard-free light of day, it's obvious that this was just a conceptual hangover from the Year of Earnest Music Composed in Cabins. But now it's finished, and those of us with beard disabilities can rejoice. Temporarily, anyway — for razors cost money, and the unhygienic laziness of musicians is not to be underestimated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Harlem Shakes played a largely acoustic set, and mentioned offhandedly that they'd &amp;quot;lost&amp;quot; some equipment, conveying the impression that as consummate professionals they had recovered from larcenous adversity by composing off-the-cuff acoustic arrangements. The rock flute was deployed! And then the rock sax! And then the last two songs suddenly featured a drum kit and bass and electric six string, so, um, what?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They're doomed anyway. Harlem Shakes is a very good band, but their timing is all wrong. If they were eighteen months out from the last time David Byrne or Clap Your Hands did something? Sure, everyone would recognize that these guys are excellent musicians who make inspiring music. But they aren't, so they won't. Amanda and Catherine are probably right that the next album will settle things, but at the moment, critics' self-satisfaction at their ability to name the group's influences is dooming the band.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We — you and I — are never going to escape this musical moment. These fucking synths — these goddamn waxy, Miami-fucking-Vice synths... Stick them alongside modern percussive artillery and our entire generation (+/-1) is powerless to resist. MGMT, Justice, Phoenix — all are trading on this unfortunate artifact of our upbringing. No doubt it will repeat, too, as the tautologically corny soundtracks of future generations' childhoods are resuscitated by the bass-heavy trend of the moment, and that same stupid retro timbre will spawn era after era of not-quite-dance tracks waiting to be remixed into club smashes. There's no question that Passion Pit is writing itself into this history. But they do, occasionally, lean over the edge of it. And maybe I'm just a sucker for this — actually, I &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; I'm a sucker for this, for any hint of rock and roll catharsis, for just the sound of human voices reaching — but yeah, Passion Pit are capable of pushing beyond the easy rut they've inherited. They didn't care to do it often enough to make me stay for the encore, though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But still: I enjoyed the show. Maybe I'm just getting old; these days it just needs to be loud, the people on stage just need to be feeling something. That's all it takes. Let's hear it for making a terrific racket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this tips the karmic scales in favor of sharing an MP3, don't you? So here, have a listen to &amp;quot;Strictly Game&amp;quot;. This may not be the best track for hooking people — &amp;quot;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://hypem.com/search/harlem+shakes+sunlight/1/"&gt;Sunlight&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; is pretty clearly the catchiest, danciest thing on the record — but it's the track I'm currently most enamored with. But hey, they're all pretty good — the title track's the only one I'm lukewarm on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external" href="/mp3/Harlem%20Shakes%20-%20Strictly%20Game.mp3"&gt;Harlem Shakes – Strictly Game&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And don't miss Amanda's concert-grief-counseling strategy — that Pomegranates track she posted is awfully good, even if naming your band after the world's most overhyped fruit is practically begging for dismissive reviews.&lt;/p&gt;

I agree with everyone about the new Yeah Yeah Yeahs, and &lt;em&gt;Bromst&lt;/em&gt; will certainly be one of the records I remember from 2009, but right now &lt;em&gt;Technicolor Health&lt;/em&gt; is dominating my playlist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll refrain from trying to review the damn thing myself and instead point you toward &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.cokemachineglow.com/record_review/4389/harlemshakes-technicolorhealth-2009"&gt;this writeup&lt;/a&gt;, several paragraphs of which I heartily endorse despite its basically missing the point:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Technicolor Health is some sick candy: itâ€™s what our indie pop should sound like in 2009. It imagines a world where The OC still matters, where goddamned Kanye West is agreeably employed, and where your little brother doesnâ€™t think itâ€™s just ok to listen to Neutral Milk Hotel that many times/isnâ€™t aware of more than half of the bands the Shakes are copping freely when theyâ€™re not just writing sad songs about girls, which is a lot. This is indie pop. This is your lousy local band carried forward starship-like into a fizzing pop nebula and left to spin so fast and so ably that you ultimately forget the baggage and any corny adage; because Technicolor Health fundamentally sounds good and because its songs are well-crafted enough to make a lot of the African drumming and horns sound less like garnish and more like some well-earned reward for writing songs strong enough to make that shit sound sort of necessary. Technicolor Health is self-sufficient. It isnâ€™t community, it eats itself. It is every good-to-great pre-Wincing the Night Away (2007) indie pop record brought forth and actualised as the definitive good-to-great (but mostly great) indie pop record you should be hearing as spring turns into summer, 2009. The Harlem Shakes wear everybodyâ€™s clothes really well.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The writer seems perturbed, but I don't know why. This is what's great about pop music — about really good pop music — &lt;em&gt;it will fool you every time&lt;/em&gt;. Don't be upset or confused; this is its gift, and it would be boorish to question it. If they're doing it right, that fresh-faced young band will always sound new, they will always make your foot tap, they will always make you feel like you're soaring. Leave genealogy to the Mormons. You're wired for this shit. It doesn't have to be new, it just has to be great.&lt;/p&gt;

Now the rest of the album has made its way onto the internet, and after spending some time with it... I donno, guys. I won't claim to be the world's greatest Thermalsologist, but I really liked the last album. Unfortunately, it turns out that if you remove the anger and urgency from their music, you're left with plodding melodies and lyrics that are occasionally pretty lame (the first verse on the album certainly doesn't get things off to a very good start).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I'm still looking forward to their May show at the Black Cat. Here's hoping they decide to play all their new stuff twice as fast as they recorded it — that could go a long way toward improving things.&lt;/p&gt;

I've been patient! Ever since the first version of &amp;quot;Backfire at the Disco&amp;quot; I've bided my time, waiting for stateside tour dates and a favorable Pitchfork review. I thought that a much-touted SXSW showcase would do it, but no — I'm still waiting. In the meantime the band has released a number of increasingly overproduced (but still catchy!) singles, and seems to be prepping a new LP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also signed with Roadrunner Records, whose &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/artists/"&gt;artists page&lt;/a&gt; is hilarious enough that you really ought to visit it. It's filled with doughy, dour-looking gentleman who front bands with names like Dragonforce and DevilDriver and Nickelback, and who never, ever smile. It is probably the worst collection of bands you've ever seen — except for that one trio of little British fellas, who write catchy pop songs that are smart and fun and pretty much everything you'd want from a cheeky Liverpudlian trio. Bah! Anyway, if you can find &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Girls-Boys-Marsupials-Wombats/dp/B000GMBQ5U/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=music&amp;amp;qid=1235160247&amp;amp;sr=8-5"&gt;this album&lt;/a&gt; at a non-exorbitant price, you should really think about getting it.&lt;/p&gt;

And how I closed by saying &amp;quot;but there are a bunch of things I haven't listened to; maybe they'll be better&amp;quot;? Well, I listened to a few of them, and they've all been fantastic. Here are some albums I should've paid attention to earlier, and a few that I've been paying attention to recently:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No Age (too cool for skool, but in a pleasant way); Glasvegas (awesomely overwhelming, and prompted me to finally listen to &lt;em&gt;Lust Lust Lust&lt;/em&gt; for a full-on fuzz-fest); Gaslight Anthem (actually as good as Spencer says); Titus Andronicus (wears thin by the end, but awfully energetic). And as I mentioned, the new Dan Deacon has leaked and is fantastic — better than &lt;em&gt;Spiderman of the Rings&lt;/em&gt;, I think. Although I should preface this observation by noting that my knowledge of classical music is more or less limited to the soundtrack for Beef Council commercials, I will go so far as to say that &lt;em&gt;Bromst&lt;/em&gt; sounds Coplandesque to me in a lot of places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh! Also, Julian says that Pains of Being Pure at Heart are good, and the couple of songs I heard at his place bore that judgment out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not recommended: Andrew Bird, Animal Collective. Neither are bad (although Bird's a bit boring, which is disappointing given how wowed I've been by the handful of live TV performances of his that I've seen), but neither really did it for me, either. Admittedly, my lukewarm feelings for the AC album may have something to do with the displaced rage that its title elicits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OH YEAH:&lt;/strong&gt; Speaking of music, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/148739-guest-list-diplo"&gt;this Diplo interview&lt;/a&gt; is pretty funny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's not entirely my fault — people were getting excited about some pretty boring stuff. I wasted a lot of time on new acts that focused on nostalgic sounds, folksiness or acoustic arrangements. That's fine — the world needs a way to fill its Starbucks compilation CDs, after all. But I'm only interested in that stuff in small doses, and this year offered a surplus that was so vast as to be off-putting: Bon Iver, The Dodos, She &amp;amp; Him, The Ting Tings, Vampire Weekend and Fleet Foxes were inescapable. It would be naive to pretend that bands can or should avoid being informed by the past, but many of these acts wore their influences (e.g. Paul Simon, the guy who invented reverb) on their sleeves a bit too prominently for my taste. And the rest were just flat-out wussy. I prefer music that makes me feel young, especially now that I'm not anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other, more established acts released albums that were pretty okay, but less than mindblowing. The Hold Steady treaded water entertainingly; Mates of State inched forward rather than blasting upward; Wolf Parade finally reemerged but failed to match their debut; and Kanye made a great album that no one would be calling great if it were by, say, Imogen Heap. Also the Killers, Death Cab and Coldplay all released albums that I'm told are pretty good, but which I'm content to ignore until their component tracks show up in Rock Band.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were two albums that both made it to my iPod and seemed to actually possess some vitality: the ones from Girl Talk and Lil Wayne. Not coincidentally, both underscored how doomed the old recording industry system is. On the one hand you've got Gregg Gillis, whose work is fresh, engaging, and commercially unreleasable thanks to our intellectual property regime. On the other you've got an album that frankly seems just okay*, but which was seized upon in order to anoint a deserving new talent who'd done his reputation-making work on mixtapes and other artists' releases — although admittedly a huge commercial success, Tha Carter III was a rallying point as much as it was a collection of songs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I've now got a formidable list of 2008 albums to acquire: Titus Andronicus, Frightened Rabbit, TV On The Radio, Deerhunter, the Walkmen (sorry &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://blogstretch.blogspot.com"&gt;Amanda&lt;/a&gt;) and Gaslight Anthem (sorry &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://attackerman.firedoglake.com"&gt;Spencer&lt;/a&gt;). That's a lot of music to get through before the new year, but I'm optimistic that the exercise will leave me feeling cheerier about 2008 and the musical downturn that'll inevitably be brought on by the coming Democratic administration (less suffering means worse art, or so the theory goes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* I won't pretend that I know much about hip hop, but I find it hard to believe that anyone can make it all the way through &amp;quot;A Milli&amp;quot; when wearing headphones. On the other hand, the parts of &amp;quot;Lollipop&amp;quot; that aren't stupid are genius.&lt;/p&gt;

But live — faced with singing, emoting human beings — the relatively nuanced piano compositions of &lt;em&gt;Re-arrange Us&lt;/em&gt; are ultimately more gratifying, if less immediately, dizzyingly dopamine-pumping&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Dave's absolutely right when he says that this is a band that's still getting better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which isn't to say that they aren't already really good. This was the first time I've managed to see MoS, and I was surprised by how closely the live arrangements matched those on their records — I'd just sort of assumed that the magic of overdubs played a big role in the albums' appeal. Not so. Their high-register stuff doesn't hit as reliably as it does on the records, but then you wouldn't expect it to. In general their records seem to be a fair representation of the noises they make live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing Dave said that I will quibble with: I really liked their version of &amp;quot;Something&amp;quot;. Sure, it sounded out of place in the set. But in a good way — it sounded casual. I may be wrong — maybe they've toiled over that cover — but the impression conveyed was that you could take pretty much any classic song, feed it into the MoS machine and have it come out harmonized and singable and keyboarded-up. It makes you think that everything they touch turns to pop (not to say the Beatles aren't pop, but you know what I mean). It allowed me separate their sound from their songwriting, which made their musicianship seem all the more impressive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But like I said, you shouldn't listen to me: I'm just a hopeless fanboy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;To be fair, the poppier numbers weren't helped by the fact that the sound at the Cat, while perfectly good and perfectly audible, was turned down to a relatively humane level — comfortable, sure, but there really should've been no escape from that keyboard tone.&lt;/p&gt;

Relaunching as a direct competitor to MySpace's music player functionality strikes me as a smart move — the fidelity offered by MySpace is pretty terrible, and bands are willing to spend a few bucks, I think, for better promotional tools. There are plenty other services out there that scratch this itch, but most haven't got the brand cachet or design sense of Muxtape. I think this could turn into a nice little business for Justin, the site's creator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a side note, reading about the licensing challenges faced by Justin should underscore the impressiveness of the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://hypem.com"&gt;Hype Machine&lt;/a&gt;'s continued existence. I don't know the details of whatever arrangement Anthony worked out, but he obviously did it a while ago, when the labels were presumably less resigned to the importance of the internet. The Muxtape saga shows that threading this particular needle is still a difficult task; it must have been nearly impossible when HypeM did it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The song from the new iPod commercial will give you cavities, but you're not fooling anyone by pretending you don't have it stuck in your head:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Al3x &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/al3x/statuses/894880232"&gt;tweeted this&lt;/a&gt; a while ago, and I've been meaning to pass it along: a Beach Boys mashup that adds yet another layer of harmony — or maybe shifts everything into a different key and uses the original melody as the harmony? Whatever's going on here, it's clear that it's beyond my pretending-to-know-about-music comfort zone. One thing I can say with confidence is that the process strips away the cheery, brave face covering the song's subtle plaintiveness. It also goes THUMP THUMP THUMP, which I find less exciting. But the net effect is pleasing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friday's Penny Arcade unveiled a world of amazingly competent videogame rock. Things have come a long way in the past few years — it's no longer enough to just channel 8-bit nostalgia through a six string (although that remains pretty fun, too). Most impressive are &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.protomen.com/"&gt;The Protomen&lt;/a&gt;, who seem to be in the business of recording Thermalsish epics about Megaman. Check out the flash video at their site. Things don't really get going until past the second voiceover, but after that point they get better and better. There's also &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.protomen.com/Breaking%20Out/"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;, their newest track, an unholy mix of Springsteen &amp;amp; Styx which actually works out quite well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also linked from that post: &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.myspace.com/manfactory"&gt;Man Factory's concept album about Street Fighter 2&lt;/a&gt; (available as a free download). It's somewhat hit or miss, but the slow jam about Balrog is definitely worth your attention (as are the titles of all the tracks).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talking about this stuff prompted Chris to send me &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://zebox.com/projectx/music/"&gt;a link&lt;/a&gt; to a project of a friend of his: remixed Megaman 2 themes. I haven't listened to them all yet, but Chris is right when he says that the Amen break-laden Airman track is solid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, it's been a while since I've engaged in any Wrens advocacy. I understand that some of you are doubters. However, I also understand that a number of you are having emotional crises about getting older. Hey, me too! I've been at it since I was about 16, in fact. If you're new to this you may not have noticed just how amazing &lt;em&gt;The Meadowlands&lt;/em&gt; is when you first listened to it. The first five songs are the strongest block of album-openers I can think of — &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://songza.com/sbma44"&gt;go listen to them&lt;/a&gt;. I've been revisiting &lt;em&gt;Meadowlands&lt;/em&gt; after spending the past year or two with &lt;em&gt;Secaucus&lt;/em&gt;, and it's just as good as I remembered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The early signs at last night's Hold Steady show were not good. A group of fans had shown up wearing &amp;quot;Unified Scene Drinking Team&amp;quot; softball shirts. And while I couldn't say exactly what Craig Finn had in mind when he invented the first half of that phrase, I was pretty sure it didn't involve flipcup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The opening act compounded the problem. Homogenous pop/punk with a Bosstones scream — they weren't my thing, really, although a lot of the crowd liked them. Tuning out early gave me plenty of time to think about why the Hold Steady had given them an opening slot. I concluded that it wasn't the band, it was the idea of the band — they were joyful and enthusiastic. And visually, they covered all the bases: there were a couple of tattooed rap/rock fireplugs, an asymptotically skinny indie boy, a nerd-rock drummer peering through dirty hair and ludicrous glasses, and a little keyboard-playing white girl in a pretty Motown dress. My friend Chris summed it up well when he said they looked like a rock band from The Sims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which left me in an awkward position. As much as anything the Hold Steady have built themselves on a downright mythic idea of rock and roll and the people that listen to it. I can't say I've ever been a part of a scene like that, but it always sounded pretty good to me. Now I was standing there, staring at what I could only take to be a living shorthand for what they'd had in mind, and it was a cartoon. Suddenly I was in a crowd of fellow fucking tourists, wondering if I'd be wearing a softball jersey, too, if I'd been born into the wrong online neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then the band took to the stage and I realized what you probably already have: this is all ridiculous. Their stories are too good, the music's too good, to get tangled up in worry over authenticity. By the end of the first song Craig Finn had made us toast Joe Strummer, and I found I didn't even care if, for the people around me, the honoree wasn't any more real than Charlemagne or Holly. Their hands stayed up after the toast, and that turned out to be the important thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The show wasn't recorded, but the band did a set from this tour on World Cafe, and &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.captainsdead.com/2008/06/23/sometimes-she-partied-with-townies/"&gt;you can listen to or download it here&lt;/a&gt;.

This puts me at odds with some good friends who have jumped wholeheartedly into the half-serious Collins renaissance that's been plaguing our great land as of late. Frankly, I'm surprised it's got legs given its likely provenance, which seems to me to clearly involve &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto:_Vice_City_soundtrack"&gt;Grand Theft Auto: Vice City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/Radio_Episode.aspx?episode=339"&gt;This American Life&lt;/a&gt; and/or a need to sidestep mainstream America's rededication to all things Journey. The &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://stuffwhitepeoplelike.com/"&gt;SWPL&lt;/a&gt;ishness of the situation is so glaring as to be embarrassing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it's not just this specific musical throwback that worries me. Even though I enjoyed Yglesias's 90s alt-rock party, I have to admit that the theme made me uneasy. I believe that as we get older the first muscles to lose tone are the ones that, when tightly clenched, produce a convincing sense of irony. Sure, listening to Silverchair might seem like a great idea &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt;. But if you aren't careful, before you know it you'll be no different than your uncle who paid $120 for an obstructed view at an Eagles concert that starts at 5pm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll admit that the alternatives are grim. But I think there's at least somewhat more dignity to be had by clinging tightly to Pitchfork's Best New Music section and copies of Paste until the whole enterprise buckles and collapses under the weight of your teenage offspring's embarrassed disavowals. Nostalgia is best left to people who've given up or are too young to have been there in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I know that most people don't find this very convincing. So let me try another tack: this past weekend Emily, Scooter, Lauren, Sommer, Jeff and I were at &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.philadelphiaweekly.com/view.php?id=9329"&gt;a bar&lt;/a&gt; in Philly — one of the few where you can still smoke, and therefore one that is certifiably cool. We headed upstairs, where we found a table and some DJs. These guys seemed authentically hip: sporting horrible beards and wraithlike t-shirts, they looked like emaciated bears that had staggered out of the woods and into a Salvation Army, where they constructed poor disguises before setting off to South Philly in search of PBR specials and/or salmon. It should have been a pretty good set, in other words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead? Marcy Playground. Excusable, perhaps, for novelty value (which for some reason seems to be synonymous with &amp;quot;totally monotonous and unbearable&amp;quot;). But then they followed it up with Verve Pipe's &amp;quot;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://hypem.com/track/541481/Various+Artists-The+Verve+Pipe+-+The+Freshmen"&gt;The Freshman&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; and I knew we were doomed. The biggest hits from the darkest days of the 90s continued to issue from the speakers at an uncomfortable volume (to replicate the effect, turn your radio up and tune it to DC101).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emily eventually saved us and, pouring on the charm, got them to turn down that dag-blasted racket — we were the only patrons in the room, so it seemed okay to ask. Despite our miraculous escape, the lesson should be clear: ironic musical nostalgia is too dangerous a force to be trusted to civilians. It can go so horribly, horribly wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I understand the impulse. Maybe it's inescapable. For example, I can't help but regard this as being among the most awesomely moody things I've ever seen:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And no, I can't tell if I mean that ironically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or how great they were, anyway. It's been a while since that album came out. In between then and now most of the attention directed to Wolf Parade has been transferred to Sunset Rubdown, the incredibly self-indulgent side project masterminded by Spencer Krug, one of the band's two founders. I did not approve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WP is getting ready to finally release a new album (due to what I can only assume is a hilarious swapped-briefcase incident with the folks who run &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.pancakemountain.com/"&gt;Pancake Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, it's called &lt;em&gt;At Mount Zoomer&lt;/em&gt;). And, as these things must, it's trickled onto the internet and today, finally, onto my ipod. Stereogum &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://stereogum.com/archives/premature-evaluation/premature-evaluation-wolf-parade-at-mount-zoomer_009536.html"&gt;gave it a review&lt;/a&gt; and liked it; I'm not so sure. It's too early to say, really — these tracks sound to my uneducated ear like a rough mix. Either that, or the production is going to fall far short of the mark set by their debut's trademark &amp;quot;being pursued in the dark through the wreck of an abandoned spaceship&amp;quot; timbre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even if that's fixed, I doubt these songs are going to live up to &lt;em&gt;Apologies to the Queen Mary&lt;/em&gt;. I need to give it a few more listens, though.&lt;/p&gt;

It's short but excellent. Not as good as &lt;em&gt;Bring It Back&lt;/em&gt;, maybe, but that record is one of my favorites. This new album, &lt;em&gt;Re-Arrange Us&lt;/em&gt;, seems to me to be a little more emotionally one-dimensional — at least at first listen — but the band is continuing to avoid repeating itself while maintaining a beautiful pop center that somehow fails to be embarrassing. Not, of course, that I'm very good about being embarrassed by pop music, even when I probably should be.&lt;/p&gt;
