&lt;li&gt;Update your RSS reader! Spencer has a &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://attackerman.firedoglake.com/"&gt;new home&lt;/a&gt; and a badass header. Don't let the weird teaser view (which begins after the third entry) bamboozle you into missing &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://attackerman.firedoglake.com/2008/06/25/ludasmydudeimnottrynnadis/"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;, which I especially liked, and which also gives me a good excuse to link to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://dceiver.blogspot.com/2008/06/experiment.html"&gt;DCeiver's currently-running presidential ipod experiment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whatever you do, don't pay any attention to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://stereogum.com/archives/premature-evaluation/premature-evaluation-the-hold-steady-stay-postitiv_010122.html"&gt;Stereogum's review&lt;/a&gt; of the new Hold Steady (now &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?id=282387319&amp;amp;s=143441"&gt;available on iTunes&lt;/a&gt; thanks to the record company panicking over the leak). I admit I was slow on the uptake — it's much better than I initially thought it was, largely due to the band deciding to stick its best stuff in the album's second half.
But I didn't get it as exactly backward as Stereogum does: &amp;quot;Sequestered in Memphis&amp;quot; is actually one of the album's weakest songs; &amp;quot;One for the Cutters&amp;quot; is probably the best, newest thing on the album; and &amp;quot;Constructive Summer&amp;quot; is fun and catchy but completely incidental. He's right about &amp;quot;Navy Sheets&amp;quot;, though: it really is bad.
Anyway, a much better take can be found at &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://tinymixtapes.com/The-Hold-Steady,6426"&gt;Tiny Mixtapes&lt;/a&gt;. The only thing I'd add: neither review talks about the title track, which is understandable in that it only sort-of works on the record, but also too bad in that the anthemic, wistful &amp;quot;Stay Positive&amp;quot; seems poised to be an incredibly great song to hear live — something I intend to do as soon as I can.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
