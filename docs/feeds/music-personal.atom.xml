&lt;p&gt;My sincere apologies to all the wonderful people in town for Drupalcon — I realize this is a unique opportunity to see a bunch of great folks who've gone missing from DC. I really do want to catch up with all of you. But right now I'm leaning toward staying in tonight and whimpering pathetically from underneath a blanket. Tomorrow, though, I intend to be hale, hearty &amp;amp; ready to be social.&lt;/p&gt;

That means it's also the last good opportunity to capture your attention with Christmas MP3s. I haven't got anything original to offer, but it never hurts to re-share some personal favorites:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/2008/12/23/christmas_music/The%20Pogues%20-%20Fairytale%20of%20New%20York.mp3"&gt;The Pogues – Fairytale of New York&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/2008/12/23/christmas_music/Frightened%20Rabbit%20-%20It's%20Christmas%20So%20We'll%20Stop.mp3"&gt;Frightened Rabbit – It's Christmas So We'll Stop&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose I'm willing to admit debate regarding the Frightened Rabbit song — I'm a big fan of it, and typically find myself listening to it for months after the holiday season. I even like the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Christmas-Well-Stop-Choir-Version/dp/B000ZN0KKW/ref=sr_f2_2?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=dmusic&amp;amp;qid=1230048972&amp;amp;sr=102-2"&gt;all-choral b-side version&lt;/a&gt;, and have gone so far as to buy the new 2008 version from iTunes (which, thanks to some ludicrous overproduction, isn't nearly good as the version linked here). But it's a newcomer, and so I'm willing to accept dissenting opinions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same can't be said for &amp;quot;Fairytale of New York&amp;quot;, which is pretty clearly the greatest Christmas pop song of all time. Temporary waivers allowing dissenting opinions may be granted for &amp;quot;So This Is Christmas&amp;quot;, I suppose, but only if you're feeling too depressed and dissolute to listen to the Pogues — which, unless you're presently stumbling through the trash-strewn streets, cold, alone and wearing a Santa beard caked with sick, you're probably not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, hey, here's &lt;a class="reference external" href="/2007/12/20/hey-have-some-christmas-music/"&gt;last year's equivalent post&lt;/a&gt;, which includes that Christmas Dismemberment Plan song.&lt;/p&gt;
