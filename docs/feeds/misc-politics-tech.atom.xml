I'm not sure what to think about that. I probably shouldn't bother thinking much — the idea is clearly politically impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it's intriguing nonetheless. In particular, it's interesting to consider this theoretical speed limitation as an analogue of DRM — a means of crippling devices so that consumers don't misuse them. As you might imagine, I'm not a fan of conventional DRM. I think it's inevitably circumvented and accomplishes nothing other than inconveniencing users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, I do favor some sorts of restrictions on the devices that consumers can buy and that manufacturers would like to sell to them. I approve of some forms of gun control, for instance, including limitations on the mechanical capabilities of firearms. I think that such restrictions are less easily circumvented than copy protection, and of course the consequences of a single successful circumvention do not represent a system-wide failure in the way that they would within the digital realm. That makes the undertaking a bit more worthwhile in my eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cars fall somewhere in the middle. There's already a thriving hobbyist scene devoted to swapping out engine timing chips for less efficient, more powerful alternatives. And of course more generally there's a ton of aftermarket automotive components that performance tuners can buy. I have no doubt that speed restrictors, however implemented, would be easily beaten by motivated individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But would the inconvenience of upgrading from the default limitation save lives? Probably. I'm not sure how many, though, and it's conceivable that a speed limitation may cause deaths in ways that this debate's participants aren't anticipating. I remain generally suspicious of efforts to cripple devices that consumers can buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mostly unrelatedly, during some preparatory spooky-story reading this weekend I came across this quotation from &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-new2?id=PoeGold.sgm&amp;amp;images=images/modeng&amp;amp;data=/texts/english/modeng/parsed&amp;amp;tag=public&amp;amp;part=1&amp;amp;division=div1"&gt;The Gold-Bug&lt;/a&gt;, which I thought sums up the DRM situation pretty nicely:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
[I]t may well be doubted whether human ingenuity can construct an enigma of the kind which human ingenuity may not, by proper application, resolve.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until recently public key cryptography arguably provided a counterexample, but quantum computing seems poised to prove Poe right once again.&lt;/p&gt;
