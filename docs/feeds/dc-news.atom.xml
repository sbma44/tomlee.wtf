For a while now he's been not only &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://greatergreaterwashington.org/author.cgi?username=michaelp"&gt;covering WMATA&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;[UPDATE: link fixed]&lt;/strong&gt;, but jumping through the hoops necessary to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.scribd.com/perkinsms"&gt;uncover details of their contracts, budgets and other documents&lt;/a&gt; (and working on tech projects besides!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the weekend he published his latest acquisition: &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/26194581/Nextbus-Contract-Redacted"&gt;the WMATA/Nextbus contract&lt;/a&gt;. As you might imagine, it takes the reader on a harrowing emotional rollercoaster. But before we get to that, let's build some dramatic tension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PREVIOUSLY, ON &amp;quot;LICENSING QUESTIONS RELATED TO NEXTBUS DATA&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After pulling the service due to concerns about its reliability, WMATA finally redeployed Nextbus last year. This happened not too long after the release of WMATA's scheduling information in the open GTFS format -- combined, the two excited a lot of interest in transit-enthusiast developers like myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But under what circumstances could the Nextbus data be used? The answer was not at all clear. Fortunately, Nextbus representatives began to pop up in relevant comment threads. Unfortunately, it soon became clear that there are &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; companies called Nextbus -- one of them is &amp;quot;Nextbus, Inc.&amp;quot; (which I'll call Nextbus) and one is &amp;quot;Nextbus Information Systems&amp;quot; (which I'll call NIS). I emailed back and forth with representatives from both. First, my emails with Alex Orloff from NIS:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Alex, another question for you: there's a lot of online confusion surrounding the relationship between Nextbus, Inc. and Nextbus Information Systems. Can you clarify the relationship between the two? Do you both have contracts with WMATA? And am I right in thinking that you're the company responsible for the Washington, DC-centric Nextbus app in the iPhone store? I'm seeing folks show up in blog comment sections who claim to be affiliated with these two companies, and who are asserting contradictory things.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alex:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
When the transaction that created NextBus Inc. as a wholly owned subsidiary of Grey Island Systems occurred, NextBus Information Systems kept what is called the &amp;quot;distribution business&amp;quot; piece of NextBus, which includes all the things you would associate with distribution of data - licensing to third parties, delivery to cell phones, etc. The NextBus DC app on the App Store is indeed ours. We understand that there is some confusion about the relationship and we have encouraged NextBus Inc. to put a web page on nextbus.com helping people to understand our role. We think that that would be the simplest way to clear up any confusion - don't you think ?&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of the conversation is occurring at the Greater Greater Washington blog. And yes, I agree that it would be helpful if Nextbus clarified its relationship to your organization and the bounds of its arrangement with WMATA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Am I right in thinking that Nextbus Information Systems has no formal arrangement with WMATA, but rather possesses the rights to license the distribution of some of the data emerging from the Nextbus/WMATA agreement?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry if this is muddying the waters -- just trying to get to the bottom of where I and other DC-area devs stand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aha I see the discussion now, I had seen that post a few days ago but Mike Smith's comment was not up then. Did he send you any information directly ? I'm curious as to what he said if you have contacted him directly. We are definitely trying to get NextBus to be more open about our relationship with them and our rights. Many developers are asking the same questions, and like you, many are confused about what's what.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do not have an agreement with WMATA directly, our rights come from the agreement that was part of the sale to Grey Island, which reserved exclusive rights to distribution of the predictions, in particular to cell phones but also advertising, licensing, etc. in the United States (and UK). So our agreement covers any transit agency that NextBus tracks here in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, my correspondence with Mike Smith of Nextbus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for contributing to the comment thread at Greater Greater Washington. I hope you won't mind clarifying the distinction between your organization and Nextbus Information Systems (NIS). I've been in touch with Alex Orloff of NIS, and from my discussions with him have developer the understanding that Nextbus Inc. is contracted with WMATA, but that Nextbus Information Systems -- a wholly distinct entity -- retains the rights to distribute the resulting data to mobile devices, via an API, and perhaps in other ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I and others in the DC developer/transit community find all this quite confusing. I have a number of questions that I hope you won't mind answering. I think they'll go a long way toward clarifying the situation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the relationship between Nextbus Inc. and Nextbus Information Services that I have described correct?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If NIS has the right to distribute the data, am I correct in assuming they have access to your servers? Mr. Orloff indicated a desire to have Nextbus Inc. clarify the relationship between the two firms at nextbus.com, leading me to believe that you have control over the domain; but surely he has *some* access to your systems if he is able to offer an API view of the data, as he indicated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If NIS owns the rights to distribute the data but does not control the servers, what steps is Nextbus Inc. obligated to take in order to restrict third parties' access to the publicly available data at e.g. wmata.nextbus.com?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does Nextbus assert ownership over non-predictive data produced as part of its contract with WMATA (e.g. routeconfig files)? What is its position on noncommercial use of such data?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks very much for your help in clarifying these issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be inappropriate for me to weigh in on what distribution rights that NextBus Information Systems (NBIS) does or does not have, since they are indeed a separate entity. But I can tell you that the transit agencies own the data and have legal control over it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry I cannot be of more help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wasn't able to get more out of either of them. So here's my understanding of the situation: at some point, Nextbus sold the main part of its business to Grey Island Systems. An independent portion remained, however, called Nextbus Information Systems, and it retained the rights to license prediction information generated by past -- and future! -- deals with the part now owned by Grey Island. The Grey Island/Nextbus folks say that the transit agencies they contract with own full rights to the data, same as NIS, but they're understandably hesitant to step on the NIS folks' toes (lest they get sued, presumably). Mr. Orloff was very helpful, but made it clear that I'd need to purchase a license before distributing any Nextbus-based application. Mr. Smith was also helpful, but not really empowered to speak about the licensing situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHICH BRINGS US TO THE CONTRACT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First: Grey Island Systems is listed as the parent company of the Nextbus that did business with WMATA. So far so good. But then things take a discouraging turn:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="/static/2010/02/nextbus11.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="image1" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1232" src="/static/2010/02/nextbus11.png" style="width: 450px; height: 178px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But wait! There's reason for hope: (WMATA is &amp;quot;the Authority&amp;quot; in this excerpt):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="/static/2010/02/nextbus2.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="image2" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1231" src="/static/2010/02/nextbus2.png" style="width: 500px; height: 714px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, vindication (CIS = Customer Information System, i.e. Nextbus):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="/static/2010/02/nextbus3.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="image3" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1233" src="/static/2010/02/nextbus3.png" style="width: 450px; height: 89px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's possible that I'm missing something, but at this point I think my pre-contract understanding has been validated: WMATA has full rights to the data, which means it can give the data away if it wants to. Now we just need WMATA to give the all-clear! We may also need them to mirror the data or otherwise ensure that Nextbus can't complain that we're unfairly hammering their servers. I've got some ideas about how to proceed, and I've got a serendipitous meeting happening in the next few days -- more soon, I hope!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tim, characteristically, has written &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.angryblog.org/?p=1187"&gt;the most reasonable thing I've read&lt;/a&gt; during today's Very Special Gun Control Edition of the internet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;[L]iberals and conservatives both confidently assert that the evidence is incontrovertible that gun control {increases, decreases} crime.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;[L]iberals and conservatives both confidently assert that the evidence is incontrovertible that gun control {increases, decreases} crime. I havenâ€™t studied the data closely enough to have a strong opinion one way or the other, and frankly I suspect most of the other people with opinions on the question donâ€™t know what theyâ€™re talking about either. But both sides seem able to marshall at least plausible arguments in their favor, which means that while Iâ€™m not confident of the sign, I am reasonably sure that the magnitude of the harm (or benefit) is small.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;And therefore, as a liberal, my general attitude is that in the absence of compelling evidence of harm we should have a bias toward letting people do as they please. Owning a gun may not, on net, improve your safety, but itâ€™s certainly no more dangerous than smoking, drinking, having unprotected sex, or many other activities that people are free to do in the privacy of their own homes. A lot of liberals seem to have a strange blind spot about this; liberals generally have a strong presumption in favor of letting people do as they please in the privacy of their homes, but that seems to get forgotten when the subject is owning guns.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He's right: I don't really know what I'm talking about when it comes to guns' costs and benefits. Nobody seems to, as Megan &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://meganmcardle.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/06/gun_statistics.php"&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt;. Everyone's just got a hunch — a strongly-held hunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking about it some more, I'm actually much more bothered by the idea of people buying firearms for self-defense than for sport. I try to put myself in their shoes: why would someone want to buy a gun? If it's to hunt or shoot or collect, that seems fine. All that NRA bullshit about instilling a culture of respectful, safety-oriented gun ownership isn't actually bullshit at all. I've seen it myself on NRA-funded ranges at Boy Scout camps. People who know guns know what they're going to do with their guns, and how to do it, and when they start to do it it isn't hard for them to get it done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when someone buys a gun for protection the situation is more speculative. Avoiding crime isn't really a hobby, per se. So what are they thinking about? I doubt it has anything to do with statistics. It seems much more likely that a buyer has an imagined scenario in mind — possibly vague but definitely present — that justifies the purchase. I'm sure these scenarios vary quite a lot, but if they have one unifying characteristic I'd bet it's that they're all completely ridiculous. Maybe I'm being uncharitable, but I imagine these narratives reflect Batman comics more than they do the realities of being scared, surprised or unskilled. This is the fantasy, the tautological trap that makes me view aspiration as disqualification: the idea that in that crucial moment you are likely to somehow be more than a laughable hairless ape — that somehow it will be helpful to add lethality to a moment of bewilderment — betrays a foolishness that shouldn't be trusted with a firearm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the abstract I don't begrudge anyone the right to defend themselves. But the experience in that adrenaline-filled moment is so alien and disorienting that it's a bit hard to take very seriously the cool-headed explication of an aspiring gun owner's anti-crime calculus. Of the fortunately few times when I've felt my life was in danger, the truth uniting the experiences has been that they've been nothing like I imagined. Plans would have been hilariously irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides, to carry a gun for protection from crime means you'll need to have that device on or near you a lot of the time. You, the girl who spills tampons all over her shoes whenever she roots through her purse. You, the guy who can't stop dropping his cellphone in the toilet. I know you. You tivo Grey's Anatomy, for god's sake. I'm somehow supposed to be happy that your latest personal effect can &lt;em&gt;kill me&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, I don't mean to say I don't trust you. If you're reading this the odds that you're a friend or loved one are high. But y'know, I was standing only a few feet from a friend-or-loved-one when she accidentally discharged a firearm. This was a smart person! One whom I respect! Somebody that I would gladly hire to do any number of things requiring brains and responsibility and minimal bloodlust. But, y'know, whoops. It was really fucking scary, and I would rather not face that possibility on a daily basis and a city-wide scale. It seems like a bad idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, Tim's right. Philosophically, I can't reconcile this unscientific uneasiness with what I believe about others' rights. But I also can't help wondering if those seeking safety couldn't just try to forget about the inevitably-cited unstoppable PCP-fueled edge case, and instead invest in some pepper spray or a stun gun. Or a whistle. It seems like we might all be better off. But then, that's just another hunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="line"&gt;Well, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://dcist.com/2008/06/26/us_supreme_court.php"&gt;the gun ban is over&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike a lot of my friends, I'm not particularly enthusiastic about this. Guns are amazing tools, fun to use recreationally and capable of instilling such an awesome sense of power that I don't think people are very good at rationally considering the questions surrounding them. Certainly that's been my experience whenever I shoot one — for about six hours immediately thereafter gun ownership seems like a really, really great idea. Woo guns!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think Yglesias is (sort of) right when &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://matthewyglesias.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/06/activism_i_can_believe_in.php"&gt;he says&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
From a policy perspective, what DC [was] trying to accomplish is just futile -- as long as the District is a very small patch of land adjacent to Virginia, there's no way gun regulations of this sort will prevent criminals from acquiring weapons.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is true, but probably misses the utility of a handgun ban from a police perspective. The ban was an enforcement tool: find some probable cause, search a suspect and if you find a gun they're an automatic criminal. Handy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the MPD used to employ the &amp;quot;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://secure.washingtoncitypaper.com/cgi-bin/Archive/abridged2.bat?path=q:DocRoot/2005/050902/dl_cycle&amp;amp;search=&amp;amp;&amp;amp;SearchString=&amp;amp;AuthorLastName=&amp;amp;IssueDate=06%2F17&amp;amp;SelectYear=2005&amp;amp;next.x=67&amp;amp;next.y=12"&gt;no unlicensed bikes&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; law toward approximately the same ends, which I thought was stupid and unjust. So maybe I'm a hypocrite. On the other hand, suspects with bikes are probably less nefarious, on average, than suspects with guns (recent comment threads notwithstanding).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At any rate, I think Matt is right to imply that this decision will have little effect on the level of gun violence in the city. And the Fenty administration says it's ready to respond, presumably with laws about triggerlocks and a draconian concealed carry permitting process. If the upshot is that DC residents can keep ready-to-use guns in their homes but not their cars or persons, I'll be happy enough, I suppose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh! But let me reiterate &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://thecityveins.com/blog"&gt;Charles'&lt;/a&gt; previously-stated rule: no guns in our apartment, please. This includes parties! The &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://flickr.com/photos/cappseus/2163169014/"&gt;knife fights&lt;/a&gt; are quite enough already, thanks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/strong&gt; Hmm. That excerpt of the decision quoted at DCist sure makes it sound like the court is calling triggerlock requirements unconstitutional. But hey, I'm no lawyer, and I don't recall the specifics of DC's triggerlock law. Hopefully there's some middle ground to be found, like requiring their use in any household with children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE 2:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.ryanavent.com/blog/?p=1187"&gt;Ryan==smart&lt;/a&gt;. I agree completely, with the previously-expressed caveat to his second point.&lt;/p&gt;
