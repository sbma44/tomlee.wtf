&lt;p&gt;My Spotify Wrapped was less embarrassing than it could have been--I am frozen in time in the late aughts, but that's fine with me. But it reminded me to take on one more "if only I had the time" project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been writing a personal blog since 2006, apparently!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I fell in love with technology because I feared scarcity, and because, in this world, digital technology is the only real cure for it.
