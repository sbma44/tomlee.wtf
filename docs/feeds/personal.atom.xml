&lt;p&gt;My dad had a law degree, but he never used it much. He worked demolition, then construction, then found a niche installing lighting for art. He liked playing guitar and trading stories at the gym. And he loved the video production classes he took at the Arlington Career Center. He managed to land a gig making an instructional video or two for the FDA. But video was mostly an expensive new hobby that arrived just in time for the empty nest left by his kids going to college.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was never very good at it, to be honest. He didn't have much photographic sensibility. Ironically, he failed to light many of his shots.&amp;nbsp; And he could never remember how to get things done in Premiere or Final Cut, instead writing out long lists of instructions for himself (always on graph paper)--a habit I took to be an amusing piece of fuddy duddyism at the time, but now understand to have been among the first creeping tendrils of his dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he got his diagnosis and had decided to go home to Vermont it was abrupt. He didn't want to bother anyone, I think. My sister and I learned one day that our childhood home had been sold. But I managed to grab some things, including his stacks of DV tapes, and I digitized and uploaded them a few years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never really went through them until now. There are a lot of shots of books about Congo for the documentary he never finished (our church hosted a journalist who'd fled Mbutu's regime, which got dad intrigued). There's video from his kids' graduations. Video of his buddies' bands. There is a recording of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y61v4LdguGA&amp;amp;list=PLMX2ad5XvUxCqUj36utCC1qS3Z7masJeL"&gt;an entire production by&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Le Neon,&lt;/em&gt; the French theater that opened in the strip mall up the street, whose cast my dad befriended and who would periodically descend upon our tiny house for grown-up parties bursting with Gallic charisma in a way I found terrifying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there's some video of him. I wish there was more. Clips that capture his wit, his comic timing, his enthusiasms, his laugh. Or, like here, the depth of intellect and feeling he carried through the world. Let's be frank: this video is not a good way to sell accent lighting. It is not sufficient for that task. But it's both not enough and too much--a glimpse of how much was there, what a ridiculous abundance. He renders the task for which he wrote those words irrelevant, absurd. Dad, you are supposed to be selling lights, not the sublime!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My father was a gentle, beautiful person, and everyone who met him knew it. It is tempting, sometimes, to succumb to the bitter sense that his gifts were wasted, especially after watching his disease slowly cheat him of them these last seven years. But of course they weren't wasted. I just wish those of us who got to witness them had more company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goodbye, dad. We love you. We miss you. We have missed you. We will always miss you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But to catch you up briefly: I bought a &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/ASUS-1005HA-PU1X-BK-10-1-Inch-Black-Netbook/dp/B002DYIXMI/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=electronics&amp;amp;qid=1253554452&amp;amp;sr=8-1"&gt;netbook&lt;/a&gt;; Emily and I remain enthralled by &lt;a class="reference external" href="/2009/08/23/despite-the-following-i-assure-you-that-i-am-an-adult-man/"&gt;Avatar&lt;/a&gt;; Halloween preparation is picking up speed*; I am in perpetually-worse shape; Emily's cat is officially back in Philadelphia as of this morning, and her brother is in DC; and I still can't &lt;a class="reference external" href="/2009/09/10/making-redskins-radio-usably-portable/"&gt;reliably listen to the football game&lt;/a&gt; from the bus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next month is going to include a bunch of travel (Boston! Vermont!) and hopefully a slight becalming of my work life.&amp;nbsp; And if that happens, perhaps I'll write more here!&amp;nbsp; I do miss it, and appreciate those of you who have bothered to keep my humble blog in your RSS reader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process is going pretty well.&amp;nbsp; We're using &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.scarefx.com/project_coffin.html"&gt;these plans&lt;/a&gt;, and while the quoted $25 cost is pretty optimistic, it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; relatively affordable as these things go.&amp;nbsp; At this point we've got the boards completely cut; we could assemble it immediately if we wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, though, I'd like to distress the wood.&amp;nbsp; There are a lot of techniques for doing this, and we've tried several of them on scraps left from the cutting.&amp;nbsp; I'd like to produce an impossibly-weathered sort of gray plank.&amp;nbsp; The internet says the lye in oven cleaner ought to manage this, but so far it seems to have done nothing -- maybe we have the wrong oven cleaner, or perhaps the board's pressure-treated nature is interfering with the deadly chemical reaction.&amp;nbsp; Emily found a method involving vinegar and steel wool, and claims that it shows promise (I remain skeptical).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only methods that have proven to work are more physical in nature.&amp;nbsp; First, the wire brush: using a drill and an appropriate abrasive wheel allows one to scrape away the weaker portions of&amp;nbsp; the wood's surface, leaving raised ridges and producing a more fibrous, soft sort of finish.&amp;nbsp; It looks good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other method is to char the surface with a propane torch.&amp;nbsp; It doesn't produce the gray color I wanted, but the effect is sort of cool, particularly when applied after the wire brush.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both techniques are fairly labor-intensive, though (particularly the brushing when using only a hand drill).&amp;nbsp; If anyone has access to an angle grinder or feels like joining me in my garage for some beer, fire and power tools, drop me a line.&lt;/p&gt;

There is, of course, still a chance that some hardware aspect of the thing will fail. Or that there's a hidden software bug that will prevent it from rebooting on schedule. Or that I'll screw something up when I try to move the log files to a nonvolatile disk location. But for now I'm feeling pretty good about it! If you're by the Navy Yard Metro in the next month, you should drop by, see some art and ring some bells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Artomatic website makes it unfortunately difficult to find when the damn event will actually be open. But the info can be found in &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://artomatic.org/node/4976"&gt;this press release&lt;/a&gt;. The key details:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;May 29 – July 5, 2009&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Wednesdays and Thursdays, 5 p.m. â€“ 10 p.m.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Fridays and Saturdays, 12 noon â€“ 1 a.m.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Sundays, 12 noon â€“ 10 p.m.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;closed Mondays and Tuesdays.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find a map of the location &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;amp;source=s_q&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;geocode=CSWJHjvshw4KFdc0UQIdn_do-yFJ05RY2kIyxA&amp;amp;q=artomatic&amp;amp;sll=38.881137,-77.0065&amp;amp;sspn=0.011075,0.023797&amp;amp;gl=us&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;ei=bEIUStDsEJ-wiwOsxuT_Aw&amp;amp;cd=3&amp;amp;cid=38876394,-77006946,13824474862365011346&amp;amp;li=lmd&amp;amp;ll=38.878272,-77.00695&amp;amp;spn=0.011075,0.023797&amp;amp;z=16&amp;amp;iwloc=A"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; — Artomatic is in the same building as the Navy Yard Metro entrance that's closest to the ballpark. My piece is on the fourth floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OH YEAH:&lt;/strong&gt; For those interested, the project's software is &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://github.com/sbma44/artomatic/tree/master"&gt;all on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. If you're wandering in from Google in an effort to figure out how to get Python working on the Fonera with serial and network capabilities, this would be a good place to start.&lt;/p&gt;

It was an impressive performance all around, and I'm very grateful. This thing's about 3' tall, and it's what my finished piece will sit upon for display. It'll be draped in cloth, though, so this is hopefully the last time you'll see it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In less positive news:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="stolen wheel" class="center" src="/static/2009/05/11/stolen_wheel-20090511-103517.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon getting back to the Metro last night I found my rear wheel had been stolen. My current run of bad bike-luck is now impressively long (for those keeping score, the last month has gone flat, flat, flat, flat, wheel, flat, brake cable, shifter cable, trued replacement wheel, stolen other wheel). I suppose I can't complain too much — this Jamis served me very well and with very few problems for the past 3.5 years (ever since my &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.zunta.org/blog/archives/2005/02/16/loot/"&gt;lovely last bike&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.zunta.org/blog/archives/2005/10/09/post_2/"&gt;stolen&lt;/a&gt; from out in front of Logan Hardware). Karmically, I'm doing okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this is still infuriating. The return on a stolen bike wheel is miniscule — the person who took this probably got less than 5% of the retail cost of the components that I'll now have to rebuy. Worse, I know it's my fault for being rushed and parking it at a Metro and forgetting my cable. And, well, it just sucks. I try to take these things in stride, but it takes me a couple of days to let go of the anger that being victimized provokes. Last night's dreams featured some pretty elaborate bicycle-themed revenge fantasies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems to have gone fine, though. It wasn't yet bubbling by the time I left for work, but of course that was only a horrifically small number of hours since it went into the fermenter. By the time I got home from work it was bubbling away happily:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a marked improvement from my &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://internetfoodassociation.com/2009/02/09/even-more-unwanted-foam/"&gt;last brewing attempt&lt;/a&gt;, which spewed foam all over the goddamn place.

&lt;p&gt;I can't help cringing when I watch this, but I really did have a good time, and I'm grateful for being given the opportunity to represent Sunlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Washington Journal&lt;/em&gt; is an impressively high-volume operation — you're led into the studio and then it's almost immediately time to go. It's a little bit disorienting. The fact that the studio turns out to be exactly on the other side of wall on which the green room monitors are located doesn't help matters. &lt;em&gt;It's like a video window, man!&lt;/em&gt; I appreciated the coffee and the chocolate croissant, but it seems like an even nicer thing to do for your guests would be to minimize the mind-bending spatial revelations that you expose them to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't say I'm immensely pleased with my performance during the first half of the show, but things did improve as we got further in and moved on to topics that I've been working on for more than a couple of days (this recovery.gov stuff has been kind of sudden). By the twenty minute mark I was still acting weird and stilted, but not much more so than I do in real life. If I get another chance to do this maybe I'll find a way to speak fluidly for more than six syllables at a time — that's the dream, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish I had more amusing thoughts to share about the experience, but at the time I was too terrified to make many wry observations. Besides, I'm pretty sure that everyone who works in D.C. winds up on Washington Journal eventually — when I signed my name in the guestbook (marking myself as a total n00b, no doubt), I wasn't at all surprised to see the name of a friend-of-friends that I run into at parties a couple of lines above my own. What I'm trying to say is that you'll no doubt have a chance to have this experience yourself if you you have both a job in Washington and a collared shirt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh yeah! They gave me a coffee mug! This small piece of proof (the above clip could of course be entirely computer-generated and for all I know is) is now my most prized media-appearance-related mug. Previously this position was held by the mug I received for my appearance at the NBC4 Health &amp;amp; Fitness Expo, which involved walking in and helping myself to a complimentary mug. I think someone was getting crowd shots, though, so it totally counts.&lt;/p&gt;

These are places which don't qualify as America's armpits, exactly — what are we, Goro? — but they could fairly be called the sweaty small of our great nation's back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's something to recommend each of them, though, and there was a lot to recommend Houston in particular. First, my sister lives there, and she's very charming. Beth works for the nonprofit that manages &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.orangeshow.org/orange.html"&gt;The Orange Show&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.beercanhouse.org/"&gt;Beer Can House&lt;/a&gt; (both of which are very cool), and her boyfriend Jeremy is in the business of making &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethylene_oxide"&gt;deadly, spider-attracting chemicals&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ethorson/3349729432/"&gt;The two of them&lt;/a&gt; have an extremely pleasant house in the part of Houston near the highway, which is to say I have no idea where they live. It's right by a taco truck called Elena's II, though, which is across the street from a taco truck called Elena's III. I can vouch for Elena's II — that was some of the best food I've had in recent memory. Elena's III could be a crapshoot for all I know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was the first thing that Emily and I realized about Houston: the food's great. We ate Mexican food at every possible opportunity and I don't think we were ever disappointed. Real barbacoa was a revelation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drinking was good, too. Bought from the supermarket, Shiner and &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ethorson/3349729488/"&gt;Lone Star&lt;/a&gt; are unremarkable beers. But placed into their proper context — say, an ice house yard filled with Sunday sun, kids shooting basketball, dogs stealing food and friendly gentlemen who genially critique visiting Yankees' horseshoe skills while not-very-discreetly smoking joints at the corner picnic table — they become the best beers you're ever going to taste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh! We also went to the rodeo. The attached fair and livestock show are pretty much what you'd expect, except with more places selling multi-foot sausages (available with stick or without!). The actual rodeo, though, was unexpectedly great. Perhaps on repeat visits the novelty would wear off — I can imagine that the casual sexism with which the announcers discussed each barrel-riding cowgirl's beauty might start to rankle — but the actual events were thrilling and proceeded in quick succession. There's a lot to be said for watching a grown man leap from a horse onto a steer and wrestle it to the ground, and even more to be said for watching it twelve times in a row. Since then I have been surprised to find myself watching professional bullriding on television, and reading with credulous interest accounts of how the sport isn't actually cruel at all. That's how quickly this sport (see? I'm calling it a sport) can get its hooks into you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But none of the proper rodeo events could compete with the Calf Scramble. For the uninitiated, this is an event in which our human society pits its children against those of the cows. Dozens of fresh-faced Future Farmers of America race toward a smaller crowd of confused, slightly bored calves and attempt to cajole them into submission. If you manage to subdue one of the calves you'll be presented with a certificate good for the future purchase of such an animal, which you'll then presumably raise. Who knows? With hard work and a little luck, in a few years you might be one of the cowboys over at the Ag Expo applying can after can of hairspray to a bull.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The charming part of the scramble is how simultaneously overmatched and excited the kids are. Emily and I watched a post-game interview with an ecstatic and disheveled young woman who had just won a calf, and no sir, she didn't mind at all that it had stepped on her head, in fact she didn't even remember that part!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's some video of the 2005 Houston Rodeo calf scramble. Unfortunately the professional rodeo videographers who shot it seem to have been intent on playing up the desperate athletic conflict of the thing. And who can blame them? They spend most of their time filming flinty cowboys as they casually, mercilessly assert their dominance over the bovine world. But most of the calf scramble is much more hapless than that, and considerably more endearing. If you had to pick a single representative image of the proceedings it would be of a girl holding on to a calf's tail in the corner of the arena, both of them confused about what should happen next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Houston we went to Galveston, then to Austin via Lockhart. We had some &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.gaidosofgalveston.com/restaraunts.html"&gt;great seafood&lt;/a&gt; in Galveston and stayed in a fancy hotel — it was nice! — but the town's clearly still getting itself together from the hurricane's aftermath. Austin was Austin — you know it's great. Suspiciously great, in fact, like all college towns. Oh, and everything &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://grammarpolice.net"&gt;Kriston&lt;/a&gt; has said about barbecue in Lockhart is correct, and perhaps even understated. &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.kreuzmarket.com/index.shtml"&gt;Kreuz Market&lt;/a&gt; is a monastery, and imposes vows of abstinence from sauce and forks upon visitors as soon as they walk through the door. When your server turns and reaches into the fire-flecked pit behind him to retrieve some brisket, it's easy to imagine that he's actually reaching into the underworld — and is that really beef? It seems too tender. What sort of barbecue sect is this, anyway? It's all too delicious to fight, though. Accept your damnation, and be sure to try the sauerkraut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that was about it for Texas. I spent the past few days in Indianapolis at the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.ire.org/training/conference/indy09/"&gt;Computer Assisted Reporting Conference&lt;/a&gt;. The conference was good: it was fun to be told embarrassing stories about my new coworkers, and to observe the extent to which journalists everywhere seem to share the same talents and affectations — many of the same ones that I suffer from and/or aspire to. These were good people, and I felt right at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indianapolis, though... well, I don't know. They've got some creepy, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.ire.org/training/conference/indy09/"&gt;Masonic-looking monuments&lt;/a&gt;, which makes me think there may be some pretty good secret conspiracies going on. But the downtown is incredibly free of personality; the closest thing I observed to local color was an installation of the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.360indianapolis.com/Restaurants/WeberGrillRestaurant.html"&gt;Weber Grill chain restaurant&lt;/a&gt;. On the plus side, the tapwater seemed to be extremely soft, so any travelers who are more worried about limestone scale or excessive shampooing times than about access to culinary and cultural options would do well to give Indianapolis a look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In five days: Atlanta. I've been before and it was okay, although it was hard to shake the feeling that Ted Turner was singlehandedly responsible for about 90% of the city. Maybe this time will be different; I'll report back.&lt;/p&gt;

It's terrible! Or in theory it is, anyway. I actually had an extremely nice weekend: Emily came down from Philly; we ate at Corduroy; cooked a delicious Valentine's Day meal with Matt and Sara; saw &lt;em&gt;The Wrestler&lt;/em&gt;; had Szechuan hot pot with Ezra, Annie, Ethan, Kay, Ben and Amanda, and then went out for drinks with folks on Sunday. Aside from a minor fiasco involving finding a bar that wasn't so packed as to be unusable — seriously, space in DC drinking establishments is now at such a premium that booking a band has to be considered a hostile act perpetrated against the patrontariat — it was a great way to spend a birthday. Oh! And along the way I got an &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://buy.garmin.com/shop/shop.do?pID=349"&gt;exciting new electronic fitness&lt;/a&gt; gizmo, a book about werewolves and some custom-made oatmeal. Not too shabby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the moment I'm sitting at home, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://flickr.com/photos/sbma44/3284658377/"&gt;preparing&lt;/a&gt; for an &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://dclug.tux.org/dclug_meetings.html"&gt;Arduino-related presentation&lt;/a&gt; I'll be contributing to [STRIKEOUT:tomorrow] on Wednesday (not the one with Alberto; that's on the 28th), listening to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://moraladventure.blogspot.com/2009/02/world-dances-on-dd.html"&gt;the new Dan Deacon&lt;/a&gt; (which is beautiful) and playing &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance_Wars_Dual_Strike"&gt;Advance Wars&lt;/a&gt;. It's pretty pleasant! But it also seems like the sort of opportunity I ought to use for writing things here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been terrible about this, I realize. I also realize that blogged resolutions to change are stupid. But in my experience it's only possible to maintain (relative) prolificacy if I force myself into the habit — after that first push things get easier. Besides, it was mostly the process of becoming oriented to my new gig over at Sunlight that's left me too busy and distracted to do much else. But I've got some help now, and things have calmed down a bit, so yeah: blogging!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, uh... I guess that still leaves this post a little low on content, huh? Hmm. Has everyone already seen that &lt;em&gt;I'm on a Boat (ft. T-Pain)&lt;/em&gt; video?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What can I say? I'm a sucker for profanity and pashmina jokes. And, totally coincidentally, I've recently been aspiring to boat-ridership myself. It's the perfect YouTube storm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh! Also funny: &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.avclub.com/articles/eugene-mirman-answers-your-questions-about-sex-lif,23762/"&gt;Eugene Mirman&lt;/a&gt;. There, that's enough other-people's-content, right? See, I told you I'd be able to get back into the blogging swing of things.&lt;/p&gt;

I'd already decided to take the day off — a tight deadline had forced me to work an extra week's worth of evenings, plus Saturday and Sunday — so I was committed to sloth irrespective of the weather. Having snow on the ground somehow made the experience of playing hooky seem more legitimate, though, and consequently more restful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Washingtonians famously tend to freak out about snow. In truth, I think we only do so to the extent necessary to support a more important (and collectively beloved) winter weather meta-activity: complaining about how much everyone else freaks out about snow. I remember Don &amp;amp; Mike doing bits about residents stockpiling bread, milk and toiletpaper as early as their WAVA days, back when the station focused on engendering affection for C&amp;amp;C Music Factory rather than for Jesus. Sure, I believe that area residents don't really know how to drive in winter conditions. But for me and for most other folks around here that belief is much less dearly-held than the broader sentiment that, once flakes start falling, everyone else becomes an idiot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever the underlying motivation, I'm glad that we overreact to snow, sleet, slush, hail, wintry mix and of course the dread black ice. This city works too hard. It would be nice if we'd drop the rationalizations and simply acknowledge our snow-induced delays as acquiescences to the pagan meteorological gods. Divine injunctions to take it easy are too few and far between. I say that for anything over two inches we officially take the day off. Not because it's hard to get around, but just because. If any tourists look at you askance just mumble something about averting wrath.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm still waiting on the follow-up phone call, but some mail I got over the weekend has made me think that, for the second time in six months, my dental insurer has decided they aren't responsible for paying for more than a thousand dollars' worth of work that, before the procedure, my dentist assured me they would.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last time it was because they only pay for dental technologies that are no longer in use — trepanning, internally-administered quicksilver, that sort of thing. This time the procedure was safely archaic — no joke, my molar is now filled with a &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gutta_percha"&gt;tree sap discovered in 1842&lt;/a&gt; — so I suspect that instead they'll say they're off the hook because I was switching jobs. In fact I was &lt;em&gt;doubly covered&lt;/em&gt; for much of the period in question, with two — two! — separate insurance providers supposedly responsible for the care and upkeep of my mouth. There was no point at which I did not have dental coverage. I was awash in dental coverage! And yet...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that while an individual dental procedure occupies an infinite amount of time when viewed through the lens of subjective experience, when the perspective is shifted to the realm of paperwork even vast swaths of appointments suddenly collapse into single instantaneous points, which are located such that entropy/out-of-pocket-expenses are maximized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway it's all quite fascinating in a mathematical and ontological sense, but at the same time it's also really goddamn irritating.&lt;/p&gt;

Christmas obligations have ceased, and we're on to the &amp;quot;lying around&amp;quot; phase of the holidays (my favorite part). The Christmas celebrations themselves... well, they went pretty well. I got a tent! Also a Nintendo DS, and a ton of candy, and &lt;em&gt;who knows&lt;/em&gt; what delights from Emily (we're still slowly exchanging presents, but I've already gotten a copy of &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt; from her, which is pretty awesome).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exchanging presents with my family was awfully pleasant, too, as was the Grays' Christmas party (now with heated tent!) and having a chance to see old friends. Really, there's only one constituency that inexplicably dropped the ball in its Christmas celebrations: the Jews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, alright, they didn't fall so far short. Black Cat Christmas Eve was &lt;a class="reference external" href="/2006/12/25/christmas-eve-in-the-drunk-tank/"&gt;unacceptably cheerful&lt;/a&gt;, but that's hardly their fault. It was the Christmas movie-watching where the true outrage occurred. Yes, Spencer and Matt joined me to watch &lt;em&gt;The Spirit&lt;/em&gt;. But was there subsequent Chinese food to be had? No! They were too full from their preceding visit &lt;em&gt;to a Christmas party&lt;/em&gt; to get noodles. For shame, gentlemen. That is not what Jewish Christmas is all about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spencer made amends a few days later, though (Matt had left for New York), as we discussed &lt;em&gt;Valkyrie&lt;/em&gt; and my flailing bok choy accidentally sent broth spattering all over the restaurant. So I don't think I'll have to report anybody to their childhood rabbi just yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, it turns out that I've seen a ton of movies over this break:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Spirit:&lt;/strong&gt; Pretty bad, and not in a good way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Valkyrie:&lt;/strong&gt; Not bad! But (SPOILER ALERT) it turns out the good guys lose in the end.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No Country For Old Men:&lt;/strong&gt; Remains awesome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gilda:&lt;/strong&gt; Sommer tells me that this is Rita Hayworth's most famous role, and I guess it's the one featured in &lt;em&gt;The Shawshank Redemption&lt;/em&gt;. The plot concerns the titular character, who's kind of cruel sociopath, but less so than the two men who form the other points of the movie's love triangle, one of whom owns a cane-sword. Everybody is constantly smoking and being mean and answering questions with questions, which conveys an air of sophistication, apparently. And it all happens against the exotic backdrop of an illegal casino in Buenos Aires, possibly, and the intrigue and excitement that necessarily surround an illicit tungsten cartel. Frankly, that was my biggest complain with the movie: there wasn't nearly enough in it about tungsten. It's a &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tungsten"&gt;fascinating element&lt;/a&gt;! Anyway, I'm not sure that this was a good movie, exactly, but it was fun to watch, and available to stream from Netflix. Drink every time someone says &amp;quot;Johnny&amp;quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Die Hard 2:&lt;/strong&gt; A perennially-underrated (by me) entry in the &lt;em&gt;Die Hard&lt;/em&gt; franchise. It's actually pretty good! But it's also now bittersweet, thanks to the failed Fred Thompson candidacy. He's an even better pretend airport administrator than he is a pretend district attorney! It's hard to watch it and avoid thinking about what a fine pretend commander in chief he would've made.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only one other disjointed Christmas occurrence to share: the cleaning of my dad's basement, which comprised his major Christmas gift from his children. A quarter-century of water-damaged crap lay in wait. There were childhood treasures to rescue, dead rats to locate, and huge amounts of toxic dust to inhale. It took some professional help, but we did it. Here's the truck — it isn't yet full in this picture, but it was brimming by the time we called it a day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tonight: new year's! If you're still looking for a place to celebrate, you ought to come on by.&lt;/p&gt;

My friends were there, and beer was there, and unexpected friendly acquaintances were there, and it was pretty good. But the atmosphere was terrible. This was, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.zunta.org/blog/archives/2006/01/02/personal_failur/"&gt;I think&lt;/a&gt;, the fourth installment of this tradition, but right now I'm worried that we may have to find a new venue for the fifth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's what Black Cat Christmas Eve is supposed to be. First: the only open bar in town. Second: filled with put-upon Jews and self-pitying Christians. Third: silent, except for paid-for instances of &amp;quot;Fairytale of New York&amp;quot; played via the jukebox. Fourth: characterized by furtive smoking — or, if legislation precludes smoking, plenty of uncomfortable introspective pauses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;STRONGLY CONTRAINDICATED: DJs, crowds, and merriment — yet all were in abundance tonight. Extraneous DJ aside, it was like any other night in the Red Room. This probably sounds like it shouldn't be a problem — after all, I like the Red Room! But it felt wrong. I enjoy this tradition because of the atmosphere and the carefully-cultivated and variably-meta sense of self-pity that it fosters. Having a bunch of drunk Irish guys making boisterous toasts undercuts that decisively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I suppose I can't really complain. Having a good time while being surrounded by people enjoying themselves is a strange thing to bitch about. It's just that this is the one night every year that I have set aside &lt;em&gt;specifically&lt;/em&gt; for the romanticization of lonesomeness. I feel like that's not too much to ask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, it always comes back to that goddamn Pogues song — that's the whole premise. And if you want an illustration of what the Red Room Christmas Eve is supposed to be versus what it presently is, all you have to do is listen to the original version back-to-back with Stars' horrible cover:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/2008/12/25/christmas_eve_in_the_drunk_tan_1/The%20Pogues%20-%20Fairytale%20of%20New%20York.mp3"&gt;The Pogues – Fairytale of New York&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/2008/12/25/christmas_eve_in_the_drunk_tan_1/Stars%20-%20Fairytale%20of%20New%20York.mp3"&gt;Stars – Fairytale of New York&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A BIT TANGENTIAL:&lt;/strong&gt; Having just listened to it (after being forced to listen to uptempo non-Pogues songs at the Cat), I feel compelled to point out that &lt;em&gt;by far&lt;/em&gt; the most (and arguably only) devastating couplet in &amp;quot;Fairytale of New York&amp;quot; is &amp;quot;I could have been someone / well so could anyone&amp;quot;. The rest is mostly melodrama, to be honest. Still, that's a hell of a sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;

But the sulfurous stink of burning coal, the sight of underqualified undergrads poking at the fiery slag hole, and the general atmosphere of nervous excitement all combined to satisfyingly deadly effect.&lt;/p&gt;

But it's my first week on the new job, and I've been busy. Also, I've been tired: I've never been very good at waking up in the morning. At EchoDitto I'd come into work at 10 and leave around 6 or 7 or 8 if I needed to get something done. Sunlight operates on a more normal schedule, and while I've been managing to wake up without major difficulties, I haven't yet gotten this &amp;quot;go home/to bed slightly earlier&amp;quot; thing down yet. So I'm a little exhausted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things are going well, though. It's a bit lonesome in my office, but that'll be fixed as soon as I hire some folks (&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.transparencyjobs.com/jobs/56/"&gt;Here's&lt;/a&gt; the job listing for the first position we're hiring for, incidentally. I haven't yet posted the link anywhere else — it's a Manifest Density exclusive!). And as of yesterday I have an enormous whiteboard to keep me company, which is nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've mostly just been getting acclimated: drafting some documents, going to meetings, and finding opportunities to familiarize myself with Sunlight's technology. You know how first weeks go. Everybody's been extremely friendly, and it's really great to have the latitude and time to figure out the right way to solve the problem we're facing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do have one complaint, though:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These bears are part of the winter display in the lobby, and they're really starting to freak me out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today is my last day at &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.echoditto.com"&gt;EchoDitto&lt;/a&gt;. As you might imagine, it's a bit depressing. Soon I'm going to have to pack up my desk, clean my stuff out of the fridge, and play my last game of foosball as a non-guest. This is, admittedly, all fairly trivial stuff. But I'm the sort of guy who feels wistful about throwing out old CD cases, for god's sake. Change is hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genuinely, objectively awful: the fact that I have to leave my coworkers. I've been incredibly privileged to work with people this kind and smart and funny. I've learned a tremendous amount from them: about business, about running projects, about new technologies, and about leading people. And I've gotten to do it while working with some pretty cool clients: SEIU, Mother Jones and Greenpeace UK all spring to mind; plus I've gotten to contribute, at least peripherally, to efforts on behalf of the Clinton Global Initiative, Seventh Generation and the EFF, among many others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it's time to move on — I've felt that way for a little while, to be honest. The sorts of projects you get as a consultant can be a bit homogenous. Billable-hours work can be a drag. And I have to admit: I'm pretty sick of Drupal. I figured that if I was going to keep doing this sort of work, I might go freelance for a bit — even PHP is fun to code when you're in your pajamas. Or maybe I'd wander the earth fighting injustice. I hadn't really decided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something came up first, though, and I'm extremely excited about it. As of Monday I'll be working for the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.sunlightfoundation.com"&gt;Sunlight Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, an organization that I've long admired. I'll be heading up the technical side of their latest project — it's exciting, and daunting, and I can't wait to get started. It'll mean a whole new suite of technologies and challenges; a chance to assemble and lead a team of programmers; and an opportunity to build a tool that — if we do it right — could help people understand some of the ways our government works and how they could be improved. And, importantly, it'll be a chance to learn from a whole new set of brilliant colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll be hearing much more about this from me soon; for now, suffice it to say that I'd love to hear from any talented developers who might be reading (particularly if they know Python) — thomas.j.lee (at) (google's popular email service).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's going to be strange to leave EchoDitto. &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.zunta.org/blog/archives/2005/11/23/decisions/"&gt;Three years ago I asked for advice about whether I should come work here&lt;/a&gt;. The best advice I got was from Tripp:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;My experience in the tech world is that after awhile it *all* becomes relatively boring. Today's kewl new becomes tommorow's has been. Most of the kewl new is hype and remarketing of the old.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;So my advice is to focus on the people. How do you feel about the people you currently work with? If you feel good and you think it will stay that way then stick it out.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Good people can make boring work fun, and after awhile ALL work becomes boring. I say this after 27 years in the booming computer field.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;So focus on working with good people.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was right. Six months later I wrote this (while &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.zunta.org/blog/archives/2006/06/02/pimping_actuall/"&gt;shamelessly trawling for hires&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
People use the phrase &amp;quot;it was the best decision I ever made&amp;quot; to describe getting a hair transplant, or buying a boat, or ordering a Cobb salad. So I'd like to avoid joining their idiomatic ranks, but I can't. It just seems so obvious. These are the smartest, coolest, funniest, most talented people I've ever worked with, and the job itself is interesting, varied and rewarding. I look forward to work every day. Okay, every non-hungover day.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd be lying if I said I was still quite that giddy on a day-to-day basis. Things have settled down, I've gotten older, and the nature of the business — and the internet — has changed. But the part about the people is still true. I've met a lot of amazing folks because of EchoDitto. Thanks to all of you for letting me count you among my friends.&lt;/p&gt;

I had my first one on Wednesday; now I think everyone should get one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, there's a reason for my enthusiasm that may be unique to me. The first part of last week was not good. I had a headache all weekend. At first I blamed this on the fancy Belgian cider I had consumed at fake Thanksgiving; that, and the universe immediately refuting the somewhat Nietzschean theory of hangover evasion that I had explained to Yglesias at drunken length.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the headache grew, and then started coming in waves, and then the waves stopped having troughs, and it pretty much felt like someone was crushing the side of my skull with an aluminum baseball bat and the moment of impact had been frozen in time. It made for a pretty unproductive week. I hereby apologize for the following tasks and traits that I failed to perform and/or exhibit as a result of my discomfort:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conference call attentiveness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Abstention from pathetic muttering/angry cursing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Affable rock concert co-attendance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Subway conversation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cordial greeting of the oh-you're-outside-the-party-smoking variety&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Birthday enthusiasm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eating solid food at normal rates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Web content provision&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went to see the dentist pretty soon after this started — the pain seemed to radiate from suspiciously close to the tooth that had been irritatingly sensitive to cold since my &lt;a class="reference external" href="/2008/04/07/untoothsome/"&gt;massive filling session&lt;/a&gt;. WebMD was, as usual, almost completely useless, but it did get across the point that failure to have tooth pain checked out is a bad idea if you're at all fond of your jaw. The dentist took an x-ray and assured me that she continued to have a high opinion of the work she had done. I said I didn't want to cause a fuss and would try to tough it out. Doubtless I was just a victim of our society's collective neuroticism — I'd probably seen an ad for tooth pain on the subway or something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But things got worse that evening. Having been told my tooth was fine, I started shopping for candidate diseases on Wikipedia. &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporomandibular_joint_disorder"&gt;TMJ&lt;/a&gt;? Kinda lame, to be honest, and it didn't really fit the symptoms. But from there I found &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuralgia#Atypical_.28trigeminal.29_neuralgia"&gt;atypical trigeminal neuralgia&lt;/a&gt; — man, I was sorry to let that one go. I heartily recommend it to any hypochondriacs looking for an especially dire explanation for a headache. It can be difficult to treat and is so frequently misdiagnosed that (Wikipedia claims) it's sometimes called &amp;quot;the suicide disease&amp;quot;. Now we're talking!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, it turns out that I just had a prosaic infection, and that the pain was coming from the nerve's death throes. When I returned to the dentist the next day to insist on treatment (or at least a prescription for something fun), she referred me to an endodontic specialist a few blocks away. There, a doctor with a very Hispanic name and very midwestern mannerisms quickly diagnosed and treated me. Man! It was great. She was so good and the relief so immediate that I couldn't help developing a little crush on her. The only pain I felt was the prick of the novocaine needle, which — if you've ever flattered yourself by imagining that you're in the 51st percentile or better of population-wide toughness (and pretty much all guys do, pretty much all the time) — is the sort of pain that you really can't complain about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, it was about a million times better than &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://74.125.45.132/search?q=cache:Uk-PbO8E0yEJ:movering.com/node/529+site:movering.com+root+canal&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ct=clnk&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;gl=us"&gt;Emily's experience&lt;/a&gt;, and although I didn't wind up with any painkillers, I did walk away with an awesome metal instrument for emergency dental self-intervention during Thanksgiving travel (the specific procedure also calls for a butane lighter — I know!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, root canals: recommended! Would buy from again.&lt;/p&gt;
