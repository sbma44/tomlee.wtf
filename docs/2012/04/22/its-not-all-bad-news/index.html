                <p>Since I have some visitors, let me note that, despite my default position of skepticism, I don't think technology's done reshaping our world -- not by any means.</p>
<p>True, across a range of disciplines, there is cause for gloom.&nbsp;Some technologies -- batteries, getting into orbit -- sure <em>look</em>&nbsp;like they're bumping up against immutable physical limits (fingers crossed that we invent flying saucers; get on it, physicists!). Others, like the speed of your home broadband connection, are hitting commercial or regulatory problems sufficiently imposing that the benefits to overcoming them don't seem worth the cost. In other cases it's a mix: growing (and arguably justified!) bureaucracy&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;depletion of low-hanging fruit <a class="reference external" href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewherper/2011/06/27/the-decline-of-pharmaceutical-researchmeasured-in-new-drugs-and-dollars/">combine to slow progress&nbsp;to a crawl</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Future societal changes related to information technology seem likely to be more about growing adoption (&quot;even poor people have smartphones&quot;; &quot;wow, they've applied the carsharing model to&nbsp;<em>that</em>?&quot;) than the deployment of new innovations (&quot;he probably misses his&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6W4CCU9M4">old glasses</a>&quot;) -- though note that this isn't actually much of a problem for human welfare if you exclude tech journalists from your analysis.</p>
<p>Certainly some of these points of stagnation will be overcome with unanticipated developments. &nbsp;And obviously I'm just as in the dark as anyone about what those innovations will be.</p>
<p>But I can guess at a couple of things -- there are a few obvious bright spots. Supplementing education, for instance: I don't know if something like Khan Academy can serve as a kind of pedagogical prosthesis, allowing a mediocre teacher to borrow some of the skills of a great one. But it at least seems plausible, and is something that's being actively figured out.</p>
<p>Maybe more whiz-bang-ishly, I'm <em>very</em>&nbsp;excited about self-driving cars. Again, this is something that's actively being worked on: not just by Google but by a number of automakers. And, somewhat shockingly, the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/250179/nevada_approves_selfdriving_cars_after_google_lobbying_push.html">early word</a> on the regulatory state's ability to adapt is not <em>completely</em>&nbsp;depressing (though I expect it to get more so).&nbsp;I realize that this might seem like a somewhat trivial technology -- certainly when I first pondered the idea I didn't understand it to be much more than a better cruise control. &nbsp;But if you haven't, let me strongly encourage you to read Tim Lee's <a class="reference external" href="http://arstechnica.com/old/content/2008/09/future-of-driving-part-1.ars">three</a> <a class="reference external" href="http://arstechnica.com/old/content/2008/10/future-of-driving-part-2.ars">part</a> <a class="reference external" href="http://arstechnica.com/old/content/2008/11/future-of-driving-part-3.ars">series</a> on what this all could mean. It's not just about playing George Jetson and watching a movie during your next road trip. Self-driving cars would free a huge amount of human capital and dramatically reduce the number of cars and supporting infrastructure that we would collectively require. &nbsp;This has implications for our cities, our environment -- even the experience of being a child or parent (a relationship that, Matt is fond of pointing out, involves a hell of a lot of chauffeur service).</p>
<p>I genuinely think this will arrive in my lifetime (pre-dotage, even! though I think <a class="reference external" href="http://timothyblee.com/2010/11/08/a-bet/">this</a> remains an excitingly uncertain bet), and that it'll be a very big deal. &nbsp;It's worth noting that it'll also be yet one more thing fueling inequality: no more truckers, no more cabbies, fewer construction and auto workers. &nbsp;This is why I think learning <a class="reference external" href="/2012/04/17/post-scarcity/">how to make peace with our new robot overlords</a>&nbsp;is so important.</p>
