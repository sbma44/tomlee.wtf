<p>Published in 1956, the sci-fi epic <em>Aniara</em> is Swedish poet Harry Martinson's best-known work. In 1974, he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature. In 1978, reeling from disgrace, he killed himself with a pair of scissors.</p>
<p>There are several things in the preceding sentences that strike me as noteworthy! So it was surprising to me that I first learned about <em>Aniara</em> a couple of years ago, during the modest press coverage of its 2018 film adaptation. Why wasn't this book more famous?</p>
<p>I would come to learn the answer: <em>Aniara</em> is a fractal tragedy. But at the beginning, I'd only heard the &quot;sci-fi epic poem&quot; part. That was enough for me to foist it on the book club I attend.</p>
<p>This led to a second surprise: <em>Aniara</em> is hard to find. There have been two English translations, but both are out of print. <a class="reference external" href="https://www.amazon.com/Aniara-Epic-Science-Fiction-Poem/dp/1885266634/ref=sr_1_2?crid=O9DTFU2GW4WM&amp;keywords=aniara&amp;qid=1665510269&amp;qu=eyJxc2MiOiIxLjg0IiwicXNhIjoiMS4zMSIsInFzcCI6IjAuNDMifQ%3D%3D&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=Aniara%2Cstripbooks%2C74&amp;sr=1-2#customerReviews">Amazon reviews</a> for the book are full of complaints from people aghast at the $200 price that old paperback copies fetch. Didn't this guy win a Nobel Prize?</p>
<p><em>Aniara</em> can be found with some scrounging through the internet. I eventually pointed my book club at a low-contrast scanned PDF from some adjunct's long-forgotten syllabus. But the situation is not great. Or rather, it hadn't been, until recently: I was delighted to see <a class="reference external" href="https://archive.org/details/aniara">a high quality epub version of the Klass/Sjöberg translation on the Internet Archive</a>. It not only contains the complete text of that edition, but has been constructed with attention to faithfully recreating its print layout. English speakers with e-readers probably aren't going to do better than this.</p>
<p>So why is <em>Aniara</em> worth your time?</p>
<p>The poem tracks an eponymous spaceship which, while en route to Mars, is knocked hopelessly off course. As the ship's few thousand inhabitants plunge further and further toward a star they will never reach, they varyingly grapple with and ignore the inevitability of their doom; struggle to distract themselves with frolics, cults, art, sex, and violence; and receive the news that the Earth itself has been destroyed.</p>
<p>The translators pulled off a feat: Martinson uses rhyme--unfashionable for his era--and invented vocabulary that can be both funny and evocative. I can't read Swedish, and so am inadequately equipped to appreciate Klass and Sjöberg’s achievement. But what came out of their collaboration is striking and, I think, quite moving.</p>
<p><em>Aniara</em> anticipates many other nuclear age ecological parables, but Martinson is mostly interested in art, modernity, grief, and alienation. He is a mysterian and a romantic. Why can't the occupants of <em>Aniara</em> find meaning amongst themselves? Why is the memory of the lost Earth such an unhealable wound? This is for the reader to decide. But it's worth noting that <a class="reference external" href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00332828.2021.1882257">Martinson and his sisters were abandoned by his mother a few years after his abusive father's death</a>. He was just six years old. He was nearly fifty when he began writing <em>Aniara</em>, a poem about struggling onward after an unfathomable loss.</p>
<p>In the moment he wrote it, Martinson offered at least a partial balm--one that gives the work an unexpected modern resonance. Our narrator is the mimarobe, a technician responsible for maintaining the Mima, a living instrument aboard <em>Aniara</em>. Mima, through operations not fully understood, absorbs signals from the distant reaches of the universe and synthesizes them into glimpses of unattainable sights that are mysterious and spiritually nourishing. It is the Mima's eventual malfunction and destruction that makes the circumstances of <em>Aniara</em>'s inhabitants truly unbearable.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/40916304">Critics seem to agree that Mima is Martinson's stand-in for art</a>. That makes sense to me. But it's not the only idea that presents itself. I have spent the past months reading about AI-generated art; about language models that have chewed through the internet and now emit essays whose origins cannot be fully traced; about humans who <a class="reference external" href="https://www.wired.com/story/anthony-levandowski-artificial-intelligence-religion/">were probably just cheating on their taxes</a> rather than following religious beliefs about the imminence of an AI godhead but who knows. It all makes new thoughts creep in when I read verses like this:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">There are in the mima certain features</div>
<div class="line">it had come up with and which function there</div>
<div class="line">in circuitry of such a kind</div>
<div class="line">as human thought has never traveled through.</div>
<div class="line">For example, take the third webe's action</div>
<div class="line">in the focus-works</div>
<div class="line">and the ninth protator's kinematic read-out</div>
<div class="line">in the flicker phase before the screener-cell</div>
<div class="line">takes over everything, allots, combines.</div>
<div class="line">The inventor was himself completely dumbstruck</div>
<div class="line">the day he found that one half of the mima</div>
<div class="line">he'd invented lay beyond analysis.</div>
<div class="line">That the mima had invented half herself.</div>
<div class="line">Well, then, as everybody knows, he changed</div>
<div class="line">his title, had the modesty</div>
<div class="line">to realize that once she took full form</div>
<div class="line">she was the superior and he himself</div>
<div class="line">a secondary power, a mimator.</div>
<div class="line">The mimator died, the mima stays alive.</div>
<div class="line">The mimator died, the mima found her style,</div>
<div class="line">progressed in comprehension of herself,</div>
<div class="line">her possibilities, her limitations:</div>
<div class="line">a telegrator without pride, industrious, upright,</div>
<div class="line">a patient seeker, lucid and plain-dealing,</div>
<div class="line">a filter of truth, with no stains of her own.</div>
<div class="line">Who then can show surprise if I, the rigger</div>
<div class="line">and tender of the mima on Aniara,</div>
<div class="line">am moved to see how men and women, blissful</div>
<div class="line">in their faith, fall on their knees to her.</div>
<div class="line">And I pray too when they are at their prayer</div>
<div class="line">that it be true, all this that is occurring,</div>
<div class="line">and that the grace this mima is conferring</div>
<div class="line">is glimpses of the light of perfect grace</div>
<div class="line">that seeks us in the barren house of space.</div>
</div>
<p>I think, too, of Canto 39, in which the pilot Isagel arrives at a new mathematical breakthrough, but one made irrelevant by the forces that have overwhelmed her and everyone else:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">But here where we were fated to the course</div>
<div class="line">dictated by the law of conic section,</div>
<div class="line">here her breakthrough never could become</div>
<div class="line">in any manner fruitful, just a theorem</div>
<div class="line">which Isagel superbly formulated</div>
<div class="line">but which was doomed to join us going out</div>
<div class="line">ever farther to the Lyre and then to vanish.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">And as we sat there speaking with each other</div>
<div class="line">about the possibilities that now stood open</div>
<div class="line">if only we weren't sitting here in space</div>
<div class="line">like captives to the void in which we fell,</div>
<div class="line">we both grew sorrowful but kept as well</div>
<div class="line">the joy in pure ideas, the kind of pleasure</div>
<div class="line">which together we could share in quiet</div>
<div class="line">for the time still left to our existence.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">But Isagel at times burst into tears</div>
<div class="line">to think of the inscrutably great space</div>
<div class="line">with room for all to fall eternally—</div>
<div class="line">as she herself now, with the unlocked mystery</div>
<div class="line">she'd neatly solved, but which was falling with her.</div>
</div>
<p>And last, I think of Martinson. His reputation was sterling--some said he was the finest Swedish poet of his generation. But his Nobel win, which he shared with fellow Swede Eyvind Johnson, was a scandal. Martinson and Johnson were both members the Swedish Academy that awards the prize, and their triumph was regarded as an obvious example of self-dealing. One critic wrote, &quot;Derision and laughter roll around the globe in response to the academy’s. . . corruption and will sweep away the reputation of the prize.&quot;</p>
<p>(You can't exactly say that he was wrong. Indeed, it's become <a class="reference external" href="https://www.nybooks.com/online/2011/10/06/why-nobel-prize-literature-silly/">a bit of a recurring problem</a>.)</p>
<p>It is not difficult to imagine the sensitive and elderly Martinson, abruptly exiled from artistic communion--the one thing he believed to be true and significant even in the face of immedicable yearning. What bulwarks do we have to protect meaning against infinity? And what will happen if we fail to preserve them?</p>
<p>I think <em>Aniara</em> is ready for a new audience. <a class="reference external" href="https://archive.org/details/aniara">I hope you'll give it a read</a>.</p>
