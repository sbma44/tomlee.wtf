<p>This script is residing in <?php print getcwd();?>/

<?php if(file_exists('./mt-config.cgi')):?>
<strong>and</strong> it appears that this is the directory where Movable Type is installed.  Good job!</p>

<p>That means that your form declaration should look something like this:<br/>

<blockquote><pre>&lt;?php require('<?php print getcwd();?>/mt-comments-location.php'); ?&gt;

&lt;form method="post" action="&lt;?php print $PATH_TO_MT_COMMENTS;?&gt;" name="comments_form"&gt;

<em>Rest of the comments form</em>

&lt;/form&gt;
</pre></blockquote>

<?php else:?>
</p>

<p>However, it appears that this isn't the directory where Movable Type is installed &mdash; this script
couldn't detect the presence of mt-config.cgi.</p>

<p>You may have a very good reason for not putting this PHP file in your MT 
directory.  If that's the case, please use the working directory shown above
to figure out the full path of the directory where MT is installed.  Here's
the code that you'll want to use once you do:</p>

<blockquote><pre>&lt;?php require('/full/path/to/mt/mt-comments-location.php'); ?&gt;

&lt;form method="post" action="&lt;?php print $PATH_TO_MT_COMMENTS;?&gt;" name="comments_form"&gt;

<em>Rest of the comments form</em>

&lt;/form&gt;
</pre></blockquote>
