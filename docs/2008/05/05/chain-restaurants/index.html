                <p><a class="reference external" href="http://meganmcardle.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/05/false_contempt.php">Okay</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/ezraklein_archive?month=05&amp;year=2008&amp;base_name=and_ill_take_some_contempt_on">I</a> <a class="reference external" href="http://matthewyglesias.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/05/outback_strikes_back.php">agree</a>: the New York Times treating a visit to a chain restaurant like some sort of sociological safari is a pretty irritating premise for an article. And as a child of the DC suburbs whose family very, very rarely dined out, I'm not sure what kind of claim I have to this conversation. I eat a lot of arugula (it's good!), which I think probably at least partially disqualifies me.</p>
<p>But I do think we need to establish some reasonable limits on the anti-NYT populism that's currently pouring forth from the blogosphere. Because let's be honest: Outback Steakhouse is fucking disgusting. Admittedly, I've only been once. But what kind of steakhouse doesn't ask how you want your steak cooked? I honestly can't even tell you what kind of animal provided the steak I ate. It sure didn't <em>seem</em> like beef.</p>
<p>Now it's true that I'm a fan of the &quot;big greasy fried onion thing&quot; school of culinary thought. But <a class="reference external" href="http://www.redhotanblue.com/MENU.HTM">others</a> do it so much better. Add in Fosters' claim to the worst hangover:pleasing taste ratio in the beer industry, and you can see that the entire Fauxstralian concept has little to redeem it.</p>
<p>But the other chain restaurants in that article are fine. Alright, I admit to having a grudge against the Cheesecake Factory, largely on the basis of their strangely mosquelike Clarendon location (and the perpetual lines outside it) serving as a constant local reminder of the American Empire's impending collapse. And I find something a little off-putting about Olive Garden's explicitly stated promotional campaign: &quot;Come fill up on bread!&quot; But Chili's, Bertucci's, Friday's, P.F. Chang's and Applebee's are all fine (I've never eaten at a Red Lobster, but a recent Tivo subscription to &quot;Deadliest Catch&quot; is making me want to).</p>
<p>There's nothing wrong with these places' recipes, per se, other than their inability to power pretentious foodie smalltalk and their depressing implications re: our country's per capita alfredo sauce consumption. With the cost spread over millions of diners, I believe these chains are probably willing to invest seriously in coming up with dishes that are about as good as possible given the constraints of their supply chain, price range and varying levels of kitchen talent.</p>
<p>But I can understand why they have a bad reputation — and it isn't just snobbery. The difference is really just about which restaurant in the chain you visit. If you find one with a good manager, chances are you'll get decent service and decent food. If you go to one that isn't as well run — the Chili's I last visited comes to mind (it was located in some airport) — every bite will make you acutely aware of how little care went into your meal between the walk-in and your plate.</p>
<p>The power of the brand means that a bad restaurant that belongs to a franchise can stay in business much longer than a bad restaurant that belongs to a person could; which means that if you find a bad one it'll probably seem <em>particularly</em> bad. I think it's that phenomenon — our automatic capacity for mindless brand loyalty — that makes the chains seem unappealing rather than any designed aspect of the dining experiences on offer.</p>
