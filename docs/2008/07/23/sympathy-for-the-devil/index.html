<p>I'm surprised to hear myself say it, but after reading <a class="reference external" href="http://dcist.com/2008/07/23/novak_hits_pedestrian_its_not_joe_w.php">Martin's writeup</a> I feel a little bad for Bob Novak, who hit a pedestrian with his car this morning. It sounds like it was only a matter of time: the comments are just getting started, but so far about 10% are from people reporting incidents where Novak almost hit them, too.</p>
<p>But like I said, I feel bad for the guy. Bob and I go way back. When I was a little kid I used to watch the McLaughlin Group with my dad. I don't remember much from that experience besides McLaughlin's plaid Christmas jacket and the paternally-instilled lesson that Novak was a Very Bad Man. The situation became clearer during senior year of high school, when my government teacher would fulfill his educational duty by showing us taped episodes of <em>Crossfire</em>. It was an exciting time: Bill Press pioneered the disoriented, exasperated style of liberalism that would later help America ignore Al Gore; and the program itself was just beginning to metastasize into the odious force that Jon Stewart would eventually banish to another dimension. But the most remarkable spectacle was happening across the table from Press, where Robert Novak exuded pure reptilian malevolence with the sort of ease that made you want to stand up and applaud. When he tried to smile the entire class would physically recoil.</p>
<p>But now, looking back, I realize that Novakian evil isn't anything to fear. I didn't know it at the time, but the McLaughlin Groupies who should have been inspiring bone-chilling terror were Fred Barnes and Mort Kondracke. They were the true harbingers, the types of guys whose ilk might lobby for offshore drilling on the strength of an invitation to an oil magnate's daughter's super sweet sixteen; or who might accidentally launch missiles while trying to play Snood, then refuse to feel bad about it.</p>
<p>So what if Novak outs the occasional CIA agent or runs down the occasional pedestrian? His is a totally comprehensible evil. And, for what it's worth, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.radaronline.com/features/2008/07/hated_pundits_chris_matthews_keith_olbermann_bill_oreilly_an_4.php">this Radar feature</a> indicates that he's a perfectly nice old man, who delights staffers at every office holiday party with jigs played upon his famous golden fiddle.</p>
<p>My point is that Washington knows how to deal with his type: when we've had a few too many missing pedestrians and/or wars, the town's bravest men descend into the secret Masonic catacombs below and, confronting the beast with hemlock and holy water, force him to dissolve into shrieks and a foul, sulfurous mist. At this point the Washington Times prints a note indicating that Mr. Novak will be on vacation until the next solstice, and everyone declares themselves more or less satisfied.</p>
<p>That's the way things work around here, and it's a system we're comfortable with. Seeing misfortune befall ol' Bob seems like an imbalance, and that makes me sad. If I get my choice of foe I'll take reptilian evil over reptile-sized brains any day.</p>
