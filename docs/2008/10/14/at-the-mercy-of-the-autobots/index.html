                <p>Tim's <a class="reference external" href="http://arstechnica.com/articles/culture/future-of-driving-part-2.ars">article about the social changes that self-driving cars might make possible</a> is fascinating reading (so is his <a class="reference external" href="http://arstechnica.com/articles/culture/future-of-driving-part-1.ars">earlier installment of the series</a>, in which Tim discusses the history and present state of robotic car technology). But I wonder about <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ryanavent.com/blog/?p=1508">the conclusion that Ryan draws from it</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">I think the net effect of autonomous vehicles on suburban areas would be to make them denser (I think the net effect of a lot of things on suburban areas will be to make them denser). As important as those shifts, I suspect, would be the boon such vehicles would be to explicitly urban areas.</div>
<div class="line">Taxis and car-sharing services are very much complements to walkable urban life. Cheap and effective autonomous vehicles would likewise be complements to urban life, but in a much more significant manner. Itâ€™s hard to overstate the negative effect of parking on dense, urban areas. When fighting against dense, new development, NIMBYs cite parking and traffic concerns first, second, and third. Given the value of urban land, parking has massive opportunity costs. Street space in urban areas is very limited and is currently given over almost entirely to driving lanes and parking lanes. If self-driving vehicles freed up much of that space, it would make room for large increases in transit right-of-way, bike lanes, and sidewalk space.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>I think the less parking/more density argument being put forth is a bit optimistic. Obviously self-driving cars would be phased into the fleet on the road slowly. So long as that's the case, it's hard to see how self-rearranging, super-dense parking lots can be made to work. We'll have to wait for the entire fleet to turn over — a process that, given the steadily increasing quality of modern cars, will take longer and longer as we wait for robot cars to arrive. I can see how a car that's easier to share — or even just one that can drop you off and then go its merry way — could help reduce the amount of parking we need and build. But it doesn't seem likely to make a significant difference during my lifetime.</p>
<p>The more immediate consequence is this, though: if automated carsharing drives down the cost of taking a trip in a private vehicle (you don't have to pay for the full upkeep or purchase of the vehicle, or pay for a driver's time); and if not having to spend time piloting the car drives down the personal cost even further, won't that encourage more trips in private cars? And won't that actually encourage suburban settlement patterns?</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong: I think self-piloting cars will be a boon to everyone. It's just hard for me to see how easier locomotion from arbitrary point to arbitrary point will push people toward the dense settlement patterns that Ryan favors. There's a widespread perception that city schools are bad and that having a yard is nice. I really like living in a city, but I'm not sure that either of those ideas is wrong. If you tell people they can have it all — and better, that it'll all be delivered BY ROBOTS — they'll take you up on the offer.</p>
