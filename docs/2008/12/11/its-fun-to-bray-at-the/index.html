                <p>Alright, enough of this &quot;saying nice things about employers&quot; nonsense. That's not what the internet is about! It's about complaining, goddammit. So let's do some of that.</p>
<p>To wit: the YMCA. Man, I really like the YMCA. I grew up going to one with my family; once I moved into the city I joined the National Capital Y pretty quickly. It's not the cheapest or best-appointed gym out there, but I find the atmosphere congenial. Everything's old: from the unused wall nozzles that powered pneumatic equipment back in the day; to the inch-thick layer of paint on the walls; to the patrons themselves, who wander about the locker room naked while endlessly discussing squash (whatever that is). The skeptical, tentative, ever-inconclusive conversations among themerely-fiftyish men offer a glimpse into the bureaucratic lifestyle that's hard to find anywhere else. It's not exciting, but it's an essential part of this city, goddammit.</p>
<p>But they've invited my wrath. Two things. First: when I signed up, they corralled me into some sort of reverse direct deposit business. I hate doing these things because I'm paranoid about giving companies the keys to my checking account. And hey, guess what? I got a letter from the Y, and I (<a class="reference external" href="/2007/08/20/admitting-defeat/">somewhat improbably</a>) opened it, and they had decided to help themselves to an extra $25 or $50 or whatever. Times are tough, you know. They were sure I wouldn't mind. They just took it out from the larger wad of money, I probably wouldn't even notice, and besides they needed it for cigarettes so they could smoke with the seniors at lunch.</p>
<p>This left me feeling rather cross, and the reaction from the folks at the front desk (&quot;it's only $25&quot;) only buttressed my righteous indignation. But further indignities laid in wait.</p>
<p>Kickball. They're hosting kickball again this winter. Not that I remember them ever having done so before, but the signs in the hallway claim they did. Perhaps we have always been at war with kickball; I don't really know. I do know that this fills the hallways with clots of drunk or soon-to-be-drunk assholes, who whoop and don't get out of my way even when I say &quot;excuse me&quot; (admittedly through gritted teeth and a facial expression designed to drive the observer to suicide). It's a bad situation, and if you ask me, pretty disrespectful of the Y's dues-paying members, all of whom detest the kickballers.</p>
<p>I should say: I know people who play kickball who I like very much. That's the social scene they found themselves in, and so they play kickball. I can't fault them for that. Hell, my ancestors owned slaves — we're all victims of our milieu. Further, I understand perfectly well the need to invent flimsy social pretexts to justify increasingly worrying levels of post-graduation alcohol consumption. But most people don't conduct their writing workshops or networking events or connoisseurship rituals in the hallway leading to the fifth floor weight room — that's the key difference, I think. Kickball has got to go.</p>
<p>The combination of the two is especially galling. Kickball's awash in money — you can tell because the idiots responsible <a class="reference external" href="http://dcist.com/2008/08/05/kickball_lawsuit_finally_strikes_ou.php">keep trying to sue each other</a>. This is a for-profit enterprise that's wormed its drunken way into my quasi-charitable dues-based fitness club. And yet on top of the imposition-for-cash, they <em>also</em> need to steal from me? It's a bit much. The first time I run into people playing flipcup in the locker room I'm going to wind up killing somebody.</p>
