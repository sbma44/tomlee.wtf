                <p>I was going to write a post complaining about 2008's crop of music, but after reviewing a few more year end lists in addition to the first two that prompted my ire (Rolling Stone, NPR) it's clear that I was just listening to the wrong things.</p>
<p>It's not entirely my fault — people were getting excited about some pretty boring stuff. I wasted a lot of time on new acts that focused on nostalgic sounds, folksiness or acoustic arrangements. That's fine — the world needs a way to fill its Starbucks compilation CDs, after all. But I'm only interested in that stuff in small doses, and this year offered a surplus that was so vast as to be off-putting: Bon Iver, The Dodos, She &amp; Him, The Ting Tings, Vampire Weekend and Fleet Foxes were inescapable. It would be naive to pretend that bands can or should avoid being informed by the past, but many of these acts wore their influences (e.g. Paul Simon, the guy who invented reverb) on their sleeves a bit too prominently for my taste. And the rest were just flat-out wussy. I prefer music that makes me feel young, especially now that I'm not anymore.</p>
<p>Other, more established acts released albums that were pretty okay, but less than mindblowing. The Hold Steady treaded water entertainingly; Mates of State inched forward rather than blasting upward; Wolf Parade finally reemerged but failed to match their debut; and Kanye made a great album that no one would be calling great if it were by, say, Imogen Heap. Also the Killers, Death Cab and Coldplay all released albums that I'm told are pretty good, but which I'm content to ignore until their component tracks show up in Rock Band.</p>
<p>There were two albums that both made it to my iPod and seemed to actually possess some vitality: the ones from Girl Talk and Lil Wayne. Not coincidentally, both underscored how doomed the old recording industry system is. On the one hand you've got Gregg Gillis, whose work is fresh, engaging, and commercially unreleasable thanks to our intellectual property regime. On the other you've got an album that frankly seems just okay*, but which was seized upon in order to anoint a deserving new talent who'd done his reputation-making work on mixtapes and other artists' releases — although admittedly a huge commercial success, Tha Carter III was a rallying point as much as it was a collection of songs.</p>
<p>Anyway, I've now got a formidable list of 2008 albums to acquire: Titus Andronicus, Frightened Rabbit, TV On The Radio, Deerhunter, the Walkmen (sorry <a class="reference external" href="http://blogstretch.blogspot.com">Amanda</a>) and Gaslight Anthem (sorry <a class="reference external" href="http://attackerman.firedoglake.com">Spencer</a>). That's a lot of music to get through before the new year, but I'm optimistic that the exercise will leave me feeling cheerier about 2008 and the musical downturn that'll inevitably be brought on by the coming Democratic administration (less suffering means worse art, or so the theory goes).</p>
<p>* I won't pretend that I know much about hip hop, but I find it hard to believe that anyone can make it all the way through &quot;A Milli&quot; when wearing headphones. On the other hand, the parts of &quot;Lollipop&quot; that aren't stupid are genius.</p>
