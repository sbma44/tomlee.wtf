                <p>Like <a class="reference external" href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/ezra-klein/2011/02/that_is_what_it_does.html">Ezra</a>, I find <a class="reference external" href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2011/01/dropbox-on-quora.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+BradDelongsSemi-dailyJournal+(Brad+DeLong's+Semi-Daily+Journal)">this explanation</a> for Dropbox's success intellectually attractive. &nbsp;Minimalism! &nbsp;Of course! &nbsp;It's so simple! &nbsp;It's exactly the kind of thing that software developers get off on. For one thing, it legitimizes our lust for Apple products -- despite the fact that Apple UI betrays the idea more often than we admit -- because most of us can't or don't want to distinguish between <em>good aesthetics</em> and <em>simplicity</em>. &nbsp;It's sort of zen. &nbsp;It makes us feel wise. &nbsp;But in this case I don't buy it.</p>
<p>Here's what I think happened. &nbsp;Amazon launched its <a class="reference external" href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/">S3 service</a>. &nbsp;Suddenly you could buy Big Storage services at essentially marginal cost, immediately. &nbsp;No physical capital expenses, and human capital expenses were dramatically reduced (now you need a programmer who can work with AWS, but not someone who can source, install and manage huge RAID arrays in a datacenter somewhere).</p>
<p>That happened, and then a bunch of people tried to resell this service with some paper-thin rebranding/UI work. &nbsp;Kevin Rose and Leah Culver with Pownce, and some Flickr clone with too many O's in its name, and whatever, a bunch of people. &nbsp;Dropbox was the first -- as far as I know -- to come up with a funded business model that could provide a useful amount of synced storage for free.</p>
<p>Also -- and this is something that the Quora answer completely underplays -- &nbsp;Dropbox is quite technically sophisticated. &nbsp;It's not just rsync on a minute cron, you know. &nbsp;It's hooking into filesystem interrupts to notice when stuff changes in the synced folder, and doing it natively on every major OS. &nbsp;It's got quiet but powerful ways of dealing with versioning conflicts. &nbsp;It's also doing all of this with a high degree of polish (I mean: Growl notifications, c'mon). &nbsp;Plus it's smart enough to do things like notice when it needs to sync within a LAN instead of over the net, avoiding complexities you might not have considered like NAT traversal. &nbsp;It's not that it's so simple; it's actually a very sophisticated execution. &nbsp;It's just that those parts aren't necessarily visible (and no, many of its competitors were not as clever).</p>
<p>Now, this is minimalism, in a sense. &nbsp;But it's not the sort of minimalism pointed to in the Quora answer, which amounts to &quot;Let's offer fewer features than those other jerks and we'll all get rich!&quot; &nbsp;It's more about doing things that are sophisticated and difficult, and not wasting time on UI afterthoughts.</p>
<p>It was 2006 when S3 launched, but a few years isn't THAT long for a specialized market to shake out. &nbsp;Besides, S3 prices have been falling since its launch, so it could've either been a lack of investment in the synced-storage space or just the need to wait for a cheaper equilibrium point that delayed the rise of a winner in the space. &nbsp;At some point a critical mass was reached and brand recognition took over.</p>
<p>Anyway, Amazon's contribution to web infrastructure is the key here. &nbsp;Its transformative field-leveling effect on the industry (and the web's increasing reliance on it) is a story that ought to be explored more in the popular press. &nbsp;AWS deserves a bit more of the concern that Google commonly attracts for its market power.</p>
