                <p>I am now substantially de-jetlagged! &nbsp;Let's get this published quickly, then deal with the chaos of my inbox.</p>
<p>Matt was nice enough to <a class="reference external" href="http://thinkprogress.org/yglesias/2011/06/19/248045/campaign-spending-and-broadcast-media/">respond</a>; if you haven't already seen it, you should go read it. A few quick things, presented in bullet form because I think trying to write narrative transitions often gets me in trouble:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Matt's right that broadcast spending matters most at the top, of course. &nbsp;I would suggest, though, that this affects many if not all other levels of office, as politicians feel obligated to give to one another in order to reify and ascend their parties' hierarchies.</li>
<li>When discussing broadcast media, I really meant to do so in the context of independent expenditures. &nbsp;It was foolish of me to link to the Obama campaign's spending breakdown -- that gesture, intended to convey the staggering scale of communications costs, mostly just confused the issue. &nbsp;The point I wanted to make was that restricting speech that affects a race but which is made by an entity other than one of the candidates' campaigns is thorny, but perhaps not as thorny as we pretend: the mediums of expression that are most relevant to this problem aren't, shouldn't and never will be places were we can guarantee perfectly free speech.</li>
<li>Still, I admit I probably emphasized broadcast more than it deserved simply because it was rhetorically convenient for me. &nbsp;I don't know if there are SuperPACs paying for (non-coordinated!) GOTV efforts -- I suspect that campaigns wouldn't like that idea, but who knows. But I'm sure that plenty of them are paying for direct mail, which is immune to the critiques I leveled at broadcast media. And I've read some decently compelling evidence that campaign professionals consider broadcast media and direct mail to be substitutable.</li>
<li>As for spending by campaigns themselves: I suppose I'd personally be open to the idea of providing a <a class="reference external" href="http://thinkprogress.org/yglesias/2011/06/19/248158/only-15-percent-of-virginia-house-of-delegates-seats-are-being-contested/">floor</a> of support for candidates, but I wonder how much of a difference it'd make. &nbsp;It would be silly to extend the analogy very far, but in some other culturally important areas, revenue sharing sure seems less helpful at generating healthy competition than salary caps have been. &nbsp;Besides which, it seems like more robust electoral competition is something you'd pursue to make elected officials more representative of the electorate's views. &nbsp;To the extent that this is a problem at all, my impression is that institutional structure is the bigger culprit.</li>
<li>I've heard various political science professors endorse variations of &quot;the more politics the better!&quot; but this has always struck me as pretty silly -- either&nbsp;a manifestation of a fairly pathetic urge to be counted the most cynical, counterintuitive and therefore sophisticated guy in the room; or an overextension of the term &quot;politics&quot; to encompass every aspect of every democratic system for reconciling conflicting claims, to the extent that the term loses much of its meaning.</li>
</ul>
<p>Maybe this is horribly consequentialist, but for me it really comes down to this: for several reasons it strikes me as deeply unwise to put our working legislators on a&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2010/12/voinovich_spills_the_beans_sen.html">constant fundraising treadmill</a> (particularly given our legislative institutions' other tendencies toward&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2010/12/21/keeping-congress-competent-staff-pay-turnover-and-what-it-means-for-democracy/">self-lobotimization</a>). Yet that's where we've found ourselves. &nbsp;Efforts to untangle this problem quickly run afoul of speech rights. &nbsp;But the speech rights in question almost invariably belong to people who wield incredible financial, social and political power. &nbsp;What's more, the rights in question tend to be concerned with the amplification of those individuals' speech in forums that are not and will never be available to most people, rather than rights associated with getting one's message across some threshold of discoverability.</p>
<p>My principled friends will be aghast, but the idea of trampling on that particular subset of super-speech rights bothers me basically not at all. &nbsp;Sure, I would prefer a solution to this dilemma that arrives in a neatly-packaged, internally consistent collection of philosophical and legal thought. &nbsp;But if I can't have that, I will be content with something that wades through the pragmatically-minded muck along with much of the rest of our system.</p>
<p>(For the record, I would be happy to support a compromise that allows unlimited political contributions in support of speech that takes the form of&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://ronpaulblimp.com/">blimps</a>)</p>
