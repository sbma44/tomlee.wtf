                <p>Not too long ago, I went to a happy hour with a bunch of people interested in copyright policy. &nbsp;At some point I observed/complained that my ebook reader wasn't delivering very good value. &nbsp;I've stepped up my novel consumption quite a bit over the last year or so, and bought a Kindle to feed that habit. &nbsp;But it's proven to be a bad bet. Kindle books turn out to be more expensive than used copies of paper editions of the same work -- even with shipping taken into account. &nbsp;It makes no sense to me.</p>
<p>It happened that a bunch of the folks at the happy hour had strongly libertarian/conservative intellectual backgrounds, and one piped up that no, I was wrong: the greater price must reflect the superior value that consumers placed on the digital version. It's more portable, there's no wait time for deliver, and so on.</p>
<p>Obviously, this is nonsense. It takes about two seconds of thought to realize that the market for ebooks isn't much of a market. If it were, not every Kindle book would be priced at either A) $0-$0.99, B) $8.99 or $9.99, or C) some value between $10 and $13 with a note indicating that the publisher (not Amazon) set the price.</p>
<p>These prices are lower than you'd pay for a physical copy in a brick and mortar bookstore. &nbsp;But in many cases they're not lower than the Amazon price for a paper copy of the book. &nbsp;And if it's not a new release, they're *never* lower than the price of a used copy (there is, of course, no such thing as a used Kindle copy). This happens all the time. <a class="reference external" href="/static/2011/08/30/snowdrops-20110829-231941.png">Here's the latest book I would've liked to buy as a purely electronic artifact</a>. But I'm not in a hurry, so for the price it makes no sense. For paper, there's a working market. For bits, there isn't.</p>
<p>I don't doubt that Amazon and the publishers are making plenty of money in the current regime. &nbsp;I have to assume this is just because of the Kindle's dominance as a hardware platform, consequent lock-in, and the temporary price insensitivity that follows the purchase of a cool new gadget.</p>
<p>But at some point not too long from now, the publishers and Amazon will have to stop treating their customers with quite so much contempt. &nbsp;It's ludicrous that I'm being asked to pay a premium for a version of a product that is poorly laid out, almost-invariably can't be loaned to friends, and which can be easily pirated. &nbsp;Yes, I do value the syncing services that the Kindle platform provides, and I like not having to store a physical artifact. But I don't value those things enough to cough up a 30% premium -- which, for all but the biggest new releases, is what I'm being asked to pay.</p>
<p>I like the idea of ebooks quite a bit. But it's pretty insulting that, with readers happily rushing to pay for the digital infrastructure necessary to zero out publishers' distribution costs, the publishers have responded by *jacking up their prices further*. Really, how stupid do you guys think we are? And how stupid do you think we're likely to stay?</p>
