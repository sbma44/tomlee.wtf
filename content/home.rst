A few weeks ago `Sara <http://twitter.com/sasara>`__ mentioned to me that she was enjoying a band called Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros. I would've been sold on the strength of the name alone; a friend's recommendation was more than enough to make me resolve to give them a listen.

It took me a couple of weeks, though (and an additional tweet from `Matt <http://twitter.com/mstem>`__) before I got around to it. To be honest, I'm not sure I'm a fan of the album. I find large parts of it to be a bit boring; other parts remind me -- for reasons I can't quite identify -- of the sort of bloated, Fleetwood-Mac-ian WASH-FM rock that echoes off receptionist desks all over this town.

But "Home" -- goddamn, what a song.

There are a lot of things to like about it. I could've been counted as a fan on the basis of the Morricone-isms alone. And I'm a complete sucker for the female vocal, which has the sort of breathy, stretching-after-a-nap timbre that only happens when a really cute girl picks up a serious cigarette habit.

But more than that, it's an amazing recorded performance between the two singers, one that evokes a genre tradition but invigorates it with a sense of utter, honest vulnerability. I haven't heard anything like it in a while.

If someone stuck you in a studio, said "We're rolling, *try to sound in love*", could you do it this well? I'm left completely charmed, slightly wary, and unsure whether to believe in the singers' talents or (god) their love. I may vaguely hate them for making me write that sentence, but I can't deny that the sound they make together is miraculous.
