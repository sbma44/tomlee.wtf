Visiting Austin and California was great, but it's a relief to be home. The last ten days have been busy ones, and I'm feeling the effects. I did manage to finally kick my traditional month-long spring cold, but my shoes `weren't up <http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/421204130/>`__ to the amount of walking that a party-filled conference and unexplored city demanded: my legs ache and I feel pretty worn down.

For a conference about the internet I spent surprisingly little time online: electrical outlets were precious commodities, and although the organizers made an admirable attempt, the Southby wifi left a lot to be desired. So I'm slowly, painfully reimmersing myself in the internet, as if it's a scalding-hot bath. Eventually I'll be relaxed, reengaged and recovered, but for right now the 1,324 unread RSS items staring at me from NetNewsWire are more than a little intimidating.

I've got to tie a few more things up over at the `EchoDitto SXSW blog <http://sxsw.echoditto.com>`__, but later on I'll start putting stuff up here. For now, here's my collection of SXSW photos — I'll probably elaborate on the better ones later on, but at the moment I need to put these up so that I can steal the generated HTML and cross-post it to the EchoDitto blog.
