Alright, enough of this "saying nice things about employers" nonsense. That's not what the internet is about! It's about complaining, goddammit. So let's do some of that.

To wit: the YMCA. Man, I really like the YMCA. I grew up going to one with my family; once I moved into the city I joined the National Capital Y pretty quickly. It's not the cheapest or best-appointed gym out there, but I find the atmosphere congenial. Everything's old: from the unused wall nozzles that powered pneumatic equipment back in the day; to the inch-thick layer of paint on the walls; to the patrons themselves, who wander about the locker room naked while endlessly discussing squash (whatever that is). The skeptical, tentative, ever-inconclusive conversations among themerely-fiftyish men offer a glimpse into the bureaucratic lifestyle that's hard to find anywhere else. It's not exciting, but it's an essential part of this city, goddammit.

But they've invited my wrath. Two things. First: when I signed up, they corralled me into some sort of reverse direct deposit business. I hate doing these things because I'm paranoid about giving companies the keys to my checking account. And hey, guess what? I got a letter from the Y, and I (`somewhat improbably <http://www.manifestdensity.net/2007/08/20/admitting_defeat/>`__) opened it, and they had decided to help themselves to an extra $25 or $50 or whatever. Times are tough, you know. They were sure I wouldn't mind. They just took it out from the larger wad of money, I probably wouldn't even notice, and besides they needed it for cigarettes so they could smoke with the seniors at lunch.

This left me feeling rather cross, and the reaction from the folks at the front desk ("it's only $25") only buttressed my righteous indignation. But further indignities laid in wait.

Kickball. They're hosting kickball again this winter. Not that I remember them ever having done so before, but the signs in the hallway claim they did. Perhaps we have always been at war with kickball; I don't really know. I do know that this fills the hallways with clots of drunk or soon-to-be-drunk assholes, who whoop and don't get out of my way even when I say "excuse me" (admittedly through gritted teeth and a facial expression designed to drive the observer to suicide). It's a bad situation, and if you ask me, pretty disrespectful of the Y's dues-paying members, all of whom detest the kickballers.

I should say: I know people who play kickball who I like very much. That's the social scene they found themselves in, and so they play kickball. I can't fault them for that. Hell, my ancestors owned slaves — we're all victims of our milieu. Further, I understand perfectly well the need to invent flimsy social pretexts to justify increasingly worrying levels of post-graduation alcohol consumption. But most people don't conduct their writing workshops or networking events or connoisseurship rituals in the hallway leading to the fifth floor weight room — that's the key difference, I think. Kickball has got to go.

The combination of the two is especially galling. Kickball's awash in money — you can tell because the idiots responsible `keep trying to sue each other <http://dcist.com/2008/08/05/kickball_lawsuit_finally_strikes_ou.php>`__. This is a for-profit enterprise that's wormed its drunken way into my quasi-charitable dues-based fitness club. And yet on top of the imposition-for-cash, they *also* need to steal from me? It's a bit much. The first time I run into people playing flipcup in the locker room I'm going to wind up killing somebody.
