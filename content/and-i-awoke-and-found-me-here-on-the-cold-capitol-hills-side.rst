As someone who has to think about how to write DCist Morning Roundup introductions on a somewhat regular basis, I feel that I can say this with confidence: there are only so many ways to whimsically express the idea that Washingtonians are bad at driving in snow. But that doesn't make it the underlying fact any less true, as `Amanda can attest <http://blogstretch.blogspot.com/2007/12/oh-what-dummy-full-moooorning.html>`__.

I can attest to it, too. Riding my bike this morning, I coasted down the left-hand side of M Street, in the gap between the traffic and parked cars. The light was red but clearly about to change. Suddenly the driver's side door of the car one length in front and to the right of me began to swing open, and a leg emerged. I skidded to a halt, cursed and glared at the driver.

But his face was totally blank, uncomprehending, and remained so as he slowly reversed his motions. Why *shouldn't* he suddenly abandon his car and start wandering around as the light changed? It's still locomotion, after all. And in this dumbfounding urban hallucination, where even frozen water can fall from the sky, who's to say that one way of navigating the dreamscape is more valid than another?
