Our third kid is scheduled to arrive in mid-November, and this seems like a good reason to disown my less-dear offspring: let's get some perpetually unfinished projects into the wild! Hopefully doing so will set me up for a properly bleary-eyed, blank-brained paternity leave. It's set to be my last, so I feel like I'd better abandon myself to it fully.

I'll start with the least spooky. Please stand by.

And yes, this post exists as a commitment mechanism that will force me to finish the last one.
