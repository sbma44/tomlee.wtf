Via Sommer I see that `Fort Reno might be fine after all <http://wtop.com/?nid=596&sid=1406503>`__. I suppose this isn't that surprising: the park's initial closure was the result of aerial assays that used imaging to estimate the level of contamination. But of course the spectral signatures of arsenic and indie rock earnestness are nearly identical (despite the latter being at least somewhat less toxic).
