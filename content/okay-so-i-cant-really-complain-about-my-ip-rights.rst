But hey! Wonkette! That `photo <http://www.wonkette.com/politics/matthew-yglesias/blogger-dresses-funny-ends-up-on-facebook-206947.php>`__ isn't yours to use — `it's mine <http://flickr.com/photos/sbma44/57221879/in/set-1239224/>`__. Two things: first, my normally creative-commons-loving self didn't put a friendly license on the photo, precisely because my friends might not appreciate photos of themselves looking silly being republished. Second, even if I *had* put a CC license on it, you'd still be obligated to provide attribution. It's just being polite.

But I don't think they meant any harm. Judging by the permalink, Wonkette picked it up from somebody's Facebook profile after they'd already purloined it — probably somebody I know and wouldn't begrudge the use of the photo. It's all pretty understandable, I guess.

I haven't talked to Matt about it yet, but I imagine it's not actually a big deal for him, either — he's posted far sillier-looking photos of himself to his own site in the past. Still, I can't say I'm incredibly pleased about the situation. But maybe that's just because I'm sore about Wonkette `picking on Martin <http://www.wonkette.com/politics/dcist/cries-of-protest-fall-on-deaf-ears-207238.php>`__ (unjustifiably!).
