I have just returned from the dentist. The news is not good.

This was my first visit to Dr. Mills, but it was immediately obvious that she is a good-natured woman of immense cheer — I saw her give a fellow patient a butt-bump in the lobby to congratulate her recent weight loss. She and her hygienist daughter are both gentle and reassuring. But even Dr. Mills couldn't stop an "Oh boy" from escaping her lips as she stared at my teeth. Nor did she lie to me when I looked up and said, "I'm in big trouble, aren't I?"

It's my own fault, of course. To begin with, I haven't been to the Dentist since the Kerry campaign. But my culpability is worse than just that.

The last time I visited a dentist occurred in the waning days of my brain's susceptibility to maternal nagging. I drove over to Dr. W's office near Central Library on one of the Saturday mornings he favored for my family's appointments. Dr. W was a kind, effeminate man who always smelled like Vaseline. His magazine selection was terrible, but he was content to listen to patients' wishes and drill as little as possible. He was very accommodating. Too accommodating.

It had been obvious to me for some time that dental technology would continue — must continue! — to evolve. Caps? Fillings? Invisalign? These baroque appeals to vanity won't stand the test of time. How much more maintainable, elegant, even, to mount a simple feed impeller and set of crushing pins. If you've ever watched `Modern Marvels <http://store.aetv.com/html/product/index.jhtml?id=76714>`__ you understand what I mean. History will vindicate me.

I knew, of course, that the adoption of ore-crushing technology by the dental arts was still some years away. But such were the remedies I was considering: my formerly perfect teeth had shown their first signs of weakness over the year preceding this visit, and I was keen to halt the downward trend.

So I hatched a plan, and proposed it to Dr. W: what about sealants? A slowly-degrading plastic film over my molars like the one I had been given in childhood. It would keep decay out, like the bubble dome surrounding a post-zombie-apocalypse city. Dr. W considered this proposal. He couldn't see why not.

Dr. W closed that office soon after, though whether out of shame or fear of criminal liability, I couldn't say. When I explained the situation to Dr. Mills she asked me where I had gotten the procedure done and was surprised to hear me say Arlington. Clearly she had been expecting to hear the phrase "crime alley", or perhaps "Soviet prison". My teeth are fine, you see — except for the area around the sealants, where grey veins snake outward, like contagion seeping from newly-landed meteors of mysterious origin.

Soon I will be more dental amalgam than man. The question now is simply whether it will take two more visits or three to complete the transformation. It is too late for me... but perhaps others can be saved. So heed my words:

Don't go to the dentist. Wait for the crushing pins.
