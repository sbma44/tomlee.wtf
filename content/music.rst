- New Hold Steady coming soon! I guess `Pitchfork had the news on Friday <http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/news/48851-the-new-hold-steady-album-istay-positivei>`__, but I just came across `this live track <http://www.hypeful.com/2008/02/23/hold-steady-finish-fourth-album-stay-positive/>`__ today. Man. That sounds pretty promising, right?
- That *Once* song from the oscars sure was purty, huh? Oscar version `here <http://hypem.com/artist/glen+hansard++markta+irglov>`__; fuller HBO promo-music-style arrangement `here <http://hypem.com/search/frames%20falling%20slowly/1/>`__.
- The guys in Hot Chip really seem like a bunch of wieners (increasingly in a bad way).
