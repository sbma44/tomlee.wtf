| Fussily literary; I can understand why some don't enjoy it. And I'm not sure about the final act. But this felt like a useful and correct thesis about narcissism and adulthood (though for the record I myself was always awful at basketball). Probably a good book to give to your son the first time he thinks he loves someone in a potentially permanent way.
