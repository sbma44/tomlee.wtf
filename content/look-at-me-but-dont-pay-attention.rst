| Sheesh. I honestly don't understand how a group of people can run through the city in dresses by day and party in lingerie by night — all of this while drunk — yet object to `a little publicity <http://www.dcist.com/archives/2006/10/11/cross_dressing.php>`__.

I couldn't quite get him to articulate why — I sort of suspect the reason was that "those people from DC are too much like people from DC". I guess that's pretty much right, although I still appreciated his sense of tact.
