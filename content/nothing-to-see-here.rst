My internet energies remain committed elsewhere, but I would like to at least register a couple of cranky complaints about the commentary surrounding Palin:

- To everyone asserting that the Democrats just don't get it, and that only you, the author, have a privileged insight into what makes real Americans so gosh-darn *real* — and they're going to love Sarah Palin! — please, shut the fuck up. You're just guessing, you out-of-touch elitist, exactly the same way that I am. Show me some polls. Even if you dismiss the fact that the `early <http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003844485>`__ `returns <http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080903/NEWS15/80904002>`__ don't agree with your analysis, you should temper your statements with the realization that the odds of the vice presidential pick having a significant impact on the race's outcome are very, very small.
- To those using Twitter for non-humorous political analysis: you should probably stop. This applies doubly for Democrats who employ it to compliment Republican machinations in an attempt to paint themselves as bold, contrarian truth-tellers in the tradition of — what, Alan Colmes? The instantaneous, abbreviated nature of the medium makes this a tough act to pull off; you'll usually just come off sounding credulous and reactionary. The good news is that if you're reading this you're almost certainly not who I have in mind. But really: if you want to play contrarian, do it in a macroblog format. That will at least afford you enough characters to express your dumb observations in a clever-sounding way.

Whew! I sure am cantankerous this morning.

**ALSO:** Somewhat less emphatically, let me add that I (predictably) don't really buy the argument that going after Palin will prompt a meaningful backlash. In terms of media narratives, sure — but nobody should care about that. The `depressing truth <http://matthewyglesias.theatlantic.com/archives/2007/11/smear_me_once.php>`__ seems to be that the first mover advantage overwhelms the final result of most societal deliberations.
