Normally, the nicest thing you can say about any given GOP attempt to produce an internet meme is "I don't think they *meant* for it to be racist." But hey! `Some of these valentine cards are actually pretty funny <http://gopvalentine.com/>`__. Of course I don't find the political content very appealing, but the jokes are well-constructed and not mean-spirited.

On the other hand, I've been fighting with unicode for the better part of the afternoon.  So maybe I'm just primed for closed-minded jingoism at the moment (8 bits per character was plenty good enough before people insisted on all this fancy talkin'! Heck, we barely even used that last one!).
