Alright, a quick poll for those of you who love this album: what have you been listening to it on?  The last time I really checked these guys out was when they were being tweeted about endlessly during SXSW.  I headed to the Hype Machine and listened to what had been released or leaked.

It was physically unpleasant. I mean, not painful, exactly. That would be going too far.  But my old man ears really, *really* recoiled from it.

But that was all on headphones (sealed-back headphones at that). Today I'm giving the album a chance over speakers, and I have no complaints.  I actually like it!  And am adding it to my still-extremely-tenuous "2010 = summer of anthemic rock" thesis (Fang Island being the other major data point).

Maybe I'm an outlier here.  I still think the clipping is a gimmick, and one that really, really doesn't work without a room full of air to mellow it out.  But I'm excited at the prospect of being less of a pain in the ass about this record.

(And yes, I realize that this post constitutes an inevitable but still detestable descent into explicit audiophile pain-in-the-assery.  But if you know me you've known for a while that this was only a matter of time.)
