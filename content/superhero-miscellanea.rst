Peter Suderman `comes to the rescue <http://theamericanscene.com/2008/05/05/you-dont-have-to-sit-through-the-whole-thing>`__ of people like me who left the theater before *Iron Man*'s credits had stopped rolling:

Exciting! I have to admit that the Avengers aren't really a franchise I enjoy. Norse gods? Archers? It's kind of weak, and their rogue's gallery is even worse. The arbitrary combination of dissimilar characters ends up robbing each of their archetypal punch.

I *knew* there was a reason I saved that Halloween costume (besides, of course, the frankly embarrassing amounts of time and money that went into it). I just wish someone had told me that my hood was billowing inappropriately.
