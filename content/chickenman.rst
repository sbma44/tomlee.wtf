Morning Edition `talked to the Hold Steady <http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=92836913>`__ this morning, inconsiderately making me late to work. The interview's a worth a listen, as is the additional online clip in which Craig Finn talks about playing with Springsteen and his affection for the song "Atlantic City". That prompted me to go listen to the song again, which led me to `this cover <http://hypem.com/track/546678/Zeitgeist-Atlantic+City>`__, which is really pretty nice. Go have a listen.
