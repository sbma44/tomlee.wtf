`Thanks for the reminder, Ezra <http://ezraklein.typepad.com/blog/2007/07/hot-or-not-nerd.html>`__! Man, I can't believe it's been a whole year since MediaBistro's last `DC journo beauty pageant <http://www.mediabistro.com/fishbowlDC/hottest_media_types/fishbowldcs_2006_hottest_media_types_the_voting_41396.asp>`__. As you may recall, last year's contest featured a `stunning come-from-behind victory <http://mediabistro.com/articles/poll/000091/result.asp>`__ — one that unfortunately didn't count due to the deciding surge of democratic expression occurring in the 24 hours after voting closed. This in turn can be attributed to the parties responsible for the outpouring of support accidentally misreading the end date of the contest. I bet they felt pretty stupid about that.

But don't worry! I'm confident that democracy will triumph this year.
