| Wow. The past seven days have been pretty hectic — so much so that I'm a little shocked to see that it's been a week since I posted something here. Weird. Even more troubling, I haven't even been able to play with my `new toy <http://www.flickr.com/photos/44137303@N00/286872273>`__ (I'm referring to the microcontroller).
| Well, hopefully it'll calm down a bit. Election day is a good, decisive marking point. My subconscious thinks so, anyway: I've been having election dreams.
| It's pretty unusual for me. I don't dream very often — not in a way that's coherent enough to remember, at least. But these were vivid and occurred in quicker succession than I'm used to.
| The first one involved the deaths of both `Charles <http://dccharles.blogspot.com>`__' mom and `Sommer <http://cruelsommer.blogspot.com>`__. Although tragic, details remain fuzzy about the fate of the former. But I can say with confidence that Sommer died in a horrific rocket attack (delivered via helicopter) on a George Allen rally. What was she doing there? I'll leave it to Sommer to explain herself.
| The second dream was a bit weirder. I was in an airport departure lounge, getting ready to be shipped off to Iraq with a number of friends, Starship-Troopers-style. Only we weren't going to fight enormous insectoid aliens, or even Iraqis. Instead we were being sent as media grunts, drafted against our will to report fluff pieces with a pro-America spin. More specifically, we were all divvied up to produce television segments on the different member nations in the so-called `Coalition of the Willing <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinational_force_in_Iraq#List_of_nations_in_the_Coalition>`__. I got `Eritrea <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eritrea>`__, which is not actually a part of the aforementioned coalition. I was understandably worried about finding an angle for my reports.
| Both dreams were weirdly affecting. I woke up from the first one despairing, genuinely unsure of whether the narrative's victims were alive or not. I woke up from the second one furious (although this was admittedly more because of some frustrating in-dream boarding pass problems I'd had with security than because I was being forced to sugarcoat a monstrously immoral war — that part was dandy).
| Now, I'm no expert at dream interpretation. It's possible that my subconscious is actually more preocuppied with helicopters and TV news than with the election. But having *any* sort of political backdrop to my unwaking escapades is pretty weird, particularly given their rarity.
| So, for what little it's worth: I suspect we'll only get four seats in the senate. Because the universe is unjust, and it seems likely to me that at least one race will be swung by a last-minute helicopter attack.
