Back! Back from San Diego, which appeared to currently be running some sort of citywide promotional tie-in with upcoming feature file `The Mist <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0884328/>`__. It was nice enough, I guess: I attended meetings, ate continental breakfasts, and toured a number of culturally significant faux-adobe strip malls. Also, I watched about a million episodes of Deadwood's second season. Combined with jetlag, this is leading me to formulate sentences in some pretty strange/pretentious ways.

The trip was good, but my primary objective was only partially accomplished: I wanted to eat as many fish tacos as possible. Admittedly, "as possible" is somewhat nebulous goal. Still, I can identify a full two meals that conceivably could have involved fish tacos but didn't. I definitely could've done better than the soggy, lackluster experience at the airport Rubio's. And although `El Callejon <http://el-callejon.com/Encinitas_Main.html>`__ was tasty, its lack of Baja sauce, cabbagelessness, and single-ply corn tortillas provided a different taco experience than I had been expecting. Fortunately, margaritas eased the shock.

Anyway, if you're visiting San Diego I suggest you avoid those two restaurants and instead opt for That One Place Near The Water That I Went To With Jeff And Paul That One Time. It's as delicious as you've heard.
