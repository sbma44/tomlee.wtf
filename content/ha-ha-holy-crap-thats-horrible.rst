Iraq has `been banned from the Olympics <http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601116&sid=aoXMTsEyDRG0&refer=africa>`__. But take heart!

   | War and hardship, though, have not destroyed all of Iraqâ€™s dreams for international competition. The country, which has been in three wars in two decades, has a robust Paralympic team.
   | â€œAs a country that participated in many wars since 1980, we have many disabled people,â€? said Ahmed Abid Hassan, a wheelchair fencing coach. â€œOur Paralympic team is better than our Olympic team.â€?

That's via last month's `New York Times <http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/29/world/middleeast/29paralympic.html?partner=rssnyt>`__ (original source: the perpetual crushing horror of this world).
