Hey there. I'm no longer in Puerto Rico! Oh, right, I should've mentioned: Emily and I are going to Puerto Rico. Were going. Sorry. You know what I mean.

Despite what I will immodestly call an impressive series of attempts to ruin the vacation, I was ultimately unsuccessful and we ended up having a great time. Beaches so pristine as to border on cliche; rutted dirt roads weaving through palm trees and abandoned bunkers; a full assortment of rum, both spiced and regular. We were basically living in a Corona commercial for five days, except with mercifully few Corona drinkers around us.

It's taking an effort to avoid writing thousands more words about it right now, so I'd best cut this short while I still can. I'll have more to say once timesheets have been filled out and some lidocaine/aloe solution acquired. For now I'll just point out that the Caribbean is exactly as nice as you've been led to believe, and if you aren't booking tickets there *right now* you're not using your computer to optimal effect.
