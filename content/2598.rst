| At just about 200 pages, there's only so much plot that can be fit in here, particularly given the author's commitment to (and talent for) scene-setting pastoralia. But Crace manages an impressive amount of subtlety through the narrator's voice. Over and over I found myself thinking, "Well okay, but on the other hand it almost seems as if--" only to realize a few pages later that Crace had deliberately and unobtrusively led me to that creeping realization. The cumulative effect makes the unraveling of a community and the narrator's idea of his place within it deeply affecting.
| But! I confess that I finished this book after waking up in the middle of the night, and suspect that I may have missed some subtle plot points that unfolded in the book's final fifth. [spoilers removed]
| It's completely possible that I missed something important -- turns out I'm not bad at themes and empathy for characters, but can be quite block-headed about action. I'm looking forward to discussing this with some other readers who can set me straight.
