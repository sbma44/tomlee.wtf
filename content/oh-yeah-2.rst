I was too busy sitting in a board meeting/getting horribly sick to mention it at the time, but Progressive Fix `published another post from me <http://www.progressivefix.com/why-its-too-soon-to-worry-about-wireless-net-neutrality>`__, this time about why I'm not entirely comfortable with strong claims for net neutrality in the wireless space. Basically: in this case, critics' fondness for spreading FUD about neutrality being a network-killer is at least a little more justified than it normally is.
