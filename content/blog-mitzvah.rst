Last week I began contributing posts to `TechDirt <http://www.techdirt.com>`__ — if you want to read my thoughts on why Facebook sux0rs or the RIAA is evil you can now do so with the help of a much smaller font. I'm pretty happy to be posting in the same location as `Julian <http://juliansanchez.com/notes/archives/2007/11/gettin_down_and_techdirty.php>`__ and `Tim Lee <http://www.angryblog.org/>`__ — in Tim's case it's even better due to the potential hilarity that our names' similarity holds. If you ever have trouble distinguishing our entries, remember: I'm the one who's just making it all up.

I could be wrong, but I think this qualifies me as a Professional Blogger, Sort Of. In the past I've occasionally earned money for stringing sentences together, but never in a way that was totally separate from my ability to write code.

Now: where do I pick up my guild card and health insurance forms?
