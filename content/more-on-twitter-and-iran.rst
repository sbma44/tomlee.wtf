`Yglesias <http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/matthewyglesias/~3/e8u1l1-DB80/technology-and-political-change.php>`__ links to `Farrell <http://www.themonkeycage.org/2009/06/what_if_we_twittered_the_revol.html>`__; both are worth reading.

It's still not clear to me the extent to which technology is enabling intramural communication among the protesters, as opposed to simply serving as a broadcast medium between a few of them and the west. I'm very curious to find out, though, and have a few emails out to people running proxies asking how much activity they're seeing from plausibly Iranian IPs. At least one has committed to figuring this out; we'll see if he follows through.

One thing *is* increasingly clear: the `idea that you can change the world from your computer has a strong allure <http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/.a/6a00d83451c45669e201157119dc65970b-800wi>`__. From the various alleged DoS attacks underway\* to the `wrangling <http://twitter.com/cshirky/status/2187031862>`__ over `hashtags and profile data <http://reinikainen.co.uk/2009/06/iranelection-cyberwar-guide-for-beginners/>`__ (based on what seems to be pretty tenuous speculation about the regime's filtering plans and abilities), a lot of narcissism is masquerading as activism. But then, this is the internet.

\* These seem virtually certain to be counterproductive — how exactly does damaging digital communication empower the side without the TV stations in an information war? How are targets even being identified, except via the diktat of trusted-but-unverified Twitter users?

**UPDATE:** Austin Heap, who seems to be running the biggest clearinghouse for #iranelection proxies, has `written an update <http://blog.austinheap.com/2009/06/16/why/>`__ sharing some stats. He's apparently filtering source IP (seemingly using `this list <http://www.countryipblocks.net/country-blocks/select-formats/>`__) and reports 2000 connections/second. Modern browsers reuse connections for multiple HTTP requests, so that's nothing to sneeze at. I've asked him whether he's comfortable generating some stats on where the outbound traffic is going.

**WELL, HELL:** If the professional diplomats at the State Department `thinks that Twitter is vital resource for Iranian protesters <http://www.reuters.com/article/rbssTechMediaTelecomNews/idUSWBT01137420090616>`__, I suppose I can't really argue otherwise. But it doesn't make me any happier about a privately-owned technology becoming a vital part of the infrastructure supporting political activity. I should add that Twitter as a company has been nothing but praiseworthy, from how they rescheduled their downtime to the openness represented by their API. But there are limits to any for-profit enterprise's goodwill. I would feel a lot more comfortable if #iranelection was occurring on a decentralized network (and yes, I realize there are immense technological hurdles to such a thing being practical).
