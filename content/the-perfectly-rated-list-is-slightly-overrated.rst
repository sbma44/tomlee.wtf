Julian `links <http://juliansanchez.com/notes/archives/2007/06/this_post_is_so_overrated.php>`__ to `Chuck Klosterman's list of perfectly-rated bands <http://vixi.livejournal.com/198971.html>`__ (that is, bands that are neither under- nor overrated). I'm pretty sure I've seen this before, but had forgotten about it. It's a good list, with one exception:

   **New Radicals:** There are only five facts publicly known about this entity. The first is that 1998â€™s â€œYou Get What You Giveâ€? is an almost flawless Todd Rundgrenâ€“like masterwork that makes any right-thinking American want to run through a Wal-Mart semi-naked. The second is that nobody can remember the singerâ€™s name. The third is that the singer often wore a profoundly idiotic hat. The fourth is that if this anonymous, poorly hatted singer had made a follow-up album, it would have somehow made his first record seem worse. The fifth is that his album didnâ€™t quite deserve to go gold, and it didnâ€™t.

This is wrong, except for the bit about the hat. "You Get What You Give" is abysmal. It's one of those inexplicably ubiquitous songs that force listeners to conclude that the singer must be the son or daughter or lover of a powerful record industry executive. The chorus and the verses blur together, it falls back on percussive vocal delivery to hide how boring the melody is, and the lyrics are intensely banal in the sort of way that only a pop-music sentiment that's a) two decades old and b) `written by Paul McCartney <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_End_(The_Beatles_song)>`__ can be. It sounds like Jamiroquai singing tunelessly to himself in the shower and forgetting most of the words. It's really, really bad.

Also, the stupidity of that hat really can't be overstated.
