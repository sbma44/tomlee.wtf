I probably don't need to tell you this, since it's spreading through Twitter at a furious pace, but `FakeAPStylebook <http://twitter.com/FakeAPStylebook>`__ is excellent; you should be following it now, when it's free, rather than paying $15 for a less funny version of it when you spot it by the register at Border's.

It made me wonder, though: of drug dealers, professional videogame players and style guide authors, who do you think contributes least to society?  I feel like pro gamers are solidly in the positive column, if only thanks to the wealth they generate through Mountain Dew endorsements.  The other two are trickier -- you'd have to figure out how many drug dealers participate in violence, and how much violence the style guide authors elicit.  Anyway, I think it's certainly an open question.
