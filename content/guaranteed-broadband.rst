Matt sent me `this link <http://yle.fi/uutiset/news/2009/10/1mb_broadband_access_becomes_legal_right_1080940.html>`__, which mentions that Finland has just declared broadband access a legal right. By next summer, all Finnish citizens will be entitled to a 1mbps connection; within a few years that speed requirement will climb to 100mbps.

Perhaps predictably, I think this is great. Big government! Technology! Heedless disregard for cost or affected corporations! What's not to like?

Actually, though, the English-speaking press seems a little fuzzy on what exactly this announcement it means. It appears to be a guarantee of access, not a promise of internet service paid for by the state. It's also not quite as novel as it sounds: a French court `declared net access a human right <http://technology.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/tech_and_web/article6478542.ece>`__ earlier this year (though I believe that decision was expected to be quickly overturned).

But whatever the specifics, a lot of people will no doubt find the idea of enshrining network access as a right to be frivolous or silly. They shouldn't.

I think the temptation is to romanticize rights as timeless philosophical axioms; to connect them to an imagined state of nature from which your preferred understanding of the social contract then arises. It's no doubt difficult to admit technology into that picture. But what's the second amendment if not a guaranteed right to technology? "Arms" is, admittedly, a bit more poetically vague than "100mbps broadband connection". But considering all the headaches that've been produced by that bit of American lyricism, it's hard to blame the Finns for being specific.

To me it seems simple: society needs to guarantee its members the ability to do certain things, like defend themselves and communicate and participate in the economy. If the march of progress makes it absolutely or practically impossible for them to do so without access to some enabling technology, then the ability to use that technology will have to be guaranteed, too, right?
