Okay, yes, Michele Bachmann `refusing to participate in the census <http://washingtontimes.com/news/2009/jun/17/exclusive-minn-lawmaker-fears-census-abuse/>`__ is a bit kooky. But I'm sympathetic. I started participating in the Census survey of household employment a few weeks ago (SPOILER ALERT: I still have a job). The very next day I began receiving unusually high numbers of calls from phone surveys. Pepco, private companies, and who knows how many other sample-seekers who I hung up on before identifying. It's leveled off a bit since, but there was a pronounced effect.

I know, I know: they're not allowed to sell my information. It's probably just coincidence. I mean, malfeasance by the government or its agents? The very idea is ludicrous!

And yet I remain convinced by the experience. And so I understand where Michele is coming from. If they're willing to sell my phone number, is it *really* so outlandish to think that the ACORN agents administering the census will be secretly sizing up respondent families' fitness in order to facilitate the involuntary harvesting of organs (and their subsequent redistribution to welfare recipients) under the coming socialized medicine dystopia? Of course not. Stay strong, Michele.
