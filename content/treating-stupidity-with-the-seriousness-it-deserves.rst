   WWE devotees now have their own Passion Of The Christ

To which I say: it's about time. Hell, make it in Aramaic for all I care. I'll just be glad to see the industry exposed to a larger audience.

My throwaway holiday entertainment will be *The Spirit*, but there is no movie that I'm more excited about than Darren Aronofsky's take on those who live their lives in and around the squared circle. The combination of idiotic childhood nostalgia and its underpinning layers of genuine, lately-discovered pathos is incredibly heady. Go ahead, look me in the eye and try to tell me that you wouldn't want to read a novel about Optimus Prime's painful divorce.

At any rate, here's some related media to tide you over:

- An `interview with Aronofsky <http://www.moviesonline.ca/movienews_16103.html>`__, in which his smark credentials are thoroughly proven
- `Another Q&A, this time with writer Robert Siegel <http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/12/04/arts/fake.php>`__
- `Beyond the Mat <http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Beyond_the_Mat_Special_Edition/70000781>`__, a great documentary about the wrestling industry. You know that one scene with Stephen Drozd from `the Flaming Lips movie <http://www.amazon.com/Flaming-Lips-Fearless-Freaks/dp/B0007NN6J2/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=music&qid=1229983204&sr=8-1>`__? Well, picture the same thing, but with Jake "The Snake" Roberts and a thousand times more heartbreak.
