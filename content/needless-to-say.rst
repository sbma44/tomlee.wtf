I'm a little late, but I'd feel even more like a jerk if I didn't congratulate `Yglesias <http://www.matthewyglesias.com/archives/2007/04/everlarger_media_matt/>`__ on his new gig. The guy's so ludicrously talented that it seems a little silly to bother acknowledging milestones in his inevitable march to the top of Mt. Pundit. Still, this is pretty great. Way to go, Matt.
