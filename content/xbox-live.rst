As part of the holiday season's string of irresponsible purchases I picked up an Xbox 360. I haven't been playing very much so far, and what I have been playing is pretty exclusively Halo 3. But it seems likely that Charles and I will acquire some other digital entertainments in the future, so if you're on Xbox Live you should add us to your friends list regardless of how you feel about sort-of-lame first person shooters set in decidedly lame, transparently derivative sci-fi universes.

Sigh. I miss Quake 3.

At any rate, our gamertag is "Club Loser", which is not at all coincidentally what we called Jeff's videogame-filled basement during middle and high school. Come teach this n00b a lesson.
