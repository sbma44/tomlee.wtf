This video is making the progressive blogospheric rounds:

It's good! But I've gotta say: if you grew up going to a church with a halfway-competent minister — someone with some charisma and some time spent in seminary — this clip is going to sound pretty familiar. That's not to diminish it, but the cadence and patterns are amazingly similar to what I listened to every Sunday growing up. This guy's got talent, no doubt, and his message is an indisputably important one. But it's a well-trodden form. I guess I just want to point out that if you find this experience particularly moving, you can probably enjoy it on a weekly basis a few blocks from your house. It'll be a bit more Jesus-y, but the delivery and rhetorical structure will be just as satisfying.

And I say all this as a kid who grew up Presbyterian. The Frozen Chosen! I can only imagine the firestorm that a Baptist with some book-learnin' could bust out.

**ALSO:** This speech happened on July 1. Weird.
