ONE: `The beginning of the end of the Registered Traveler program <http://blogs.wsj.com/middleseat/2009/06/22/un-clear-registered-traveler-company-shuts-down/>`__. I've always `been uncomfortable </2008/06/04/new_and_better_ways_to_make_ai/>`__ with the idea behind this program — allowing the rich a means of escape from a vexing and arguably arbitrary set of collectively-self-imposed strictures `has something of a history <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indulgences#Abuses>`__, and it's not a noble one. Props to TSA, though, if the WSJ writeup really can be believed: the article cites the agency's unwillingness to relax security standards as one of the things that made CLEAR/Registered Traveler not worth the price of admission for many would-be line skippers.

TWO: `Via Caralyn <http://twitter.com/caralyngreen>`__, `Christopher Weingarten <http://blogs.villagevoice.com/music/archives/2009/06/if_you_watch_on.php>`__ on the present and future fortunes of the music critic. Points for his entirely appropriate level of occupational hopelessness; deductions for failing to make much of a case for the professional music critic's necessity. With modern publishing and search technologies, the too-many-voices argument becomes a difficult one to make, and, I think, a basically incoherent one when talking about something as inessential and universally accessible as pop music.

This isn't something I'm happy about. I have friends who are great music critics, and I'd love for them to be able to support themselves by writing record reviews. But this is sort of like saying that I'd love to see the market compensate my friends for playing Halo with me. It's clear that the costs associated with producing music criticism have fallen to the point where it's essentially a leisure activity. In a perfect world, this would be great: the resources expended to produce music criticism could be reallocated to more productive ends, and we could still be assured a steady stream of deep thinking about music (now with less market distortion!). In practice, those resources are likely to wind up allocated *less* efficiently — say, put toward debt service on a loan that financed the unnecessary sale of an alt-weekly to a clueless owner who will preside over its demise. (Woo markets!)

But we'll still have plenty of music criticism, and plenty of other good writing. I won't say something pretentious about writers writing because of some irresistible artistic compulsion. But writers will keep writing because they think writing is fun, so they'll do it when they can. And that'll be enough for the rest of us, because these days much of the writing they do will inevitably be free, our supply unrestricted. Just look at `The Awl <http://www.theawl.com/>`__, a site run by people who perfected the blogosphere, then watched it blossom, pullulate, and choke itself to death. Now they're doing it all over again, because hell, it was pretty fun for a while there, wasn't it?
