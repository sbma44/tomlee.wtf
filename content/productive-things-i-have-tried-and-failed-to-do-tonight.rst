#. **Fix my mom's plane problems**
   She forgot her passport and missed her flight to Amsterdam. After many calls to Orbitz, the next available flight toward which her fare can be applied appears to be on Saturday. And costs $4000.
#. **Migrate a friend's Typepad blog**
   After several tries, it appears that Typepad has a serious bug that prevents it from exporting more than 100 megs' worth of archives. Ticket opened.
#. **Complete an Apple rebate**
   They swapped in a new ipod for the older-generation ipod that Emily & I ordered under their promo deal, assuring us via email that it would still be eligible. Their online rebate form disagrees.

To hell with this. I'm going to play video games.
