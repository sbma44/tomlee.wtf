I spent a lot of the afternoon working on a `Wink <http://www.debugmode.com/wink/>`__ presentation, so I'm a little screencast-happy at the moment. But I thought I'd pass along `this <http://murphymac.com/slib/yahoo-pipes-intro.htm>`__ solid intro to `Yahoo Pipes <http://pipes.yahoo.com>`__, which I dug up for Kriston to further his dreams of becoming an art-criticism-fueled Galactus. If you're interested in doing something with RSS but don't find the Pipes interface intuitive, have a look.
