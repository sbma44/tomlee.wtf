Just one point: this is an app idea that has been executed `many <http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-06-29/how-to-make-embarrassing-emails-and-texts-self-destruct>`__, `many <http://thenextweb.com/apps/2011/10/04/self-destructing-and-localized-message-app-aids-anti-wall-street-protesters/>`__, `many <http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/mobile-phones/7635860/Safe-Text-brings-self-destructing-SMS-to-mobile-phones.html>`__ times before. I could find you a half-dozen other examples if I had more time for Googling "self-destruct message app" right now.

Nothing against SnapChat! If people like it, that's great. But it's a good example of software success clearly driven by cultural factors rather than the inherent attributes of the app itself\*. This distinction is very rarely made when people write about software fads, but it's important.

\* Sure, you can tell a story about design/business model/whatever. I don't think I buy it.
