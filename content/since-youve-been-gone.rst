**FIRST** I've started receiving comment spam directing me to order sausage pizza, apparently from Russia. Who am I to refuse?

Note: this constitutes further proof that phpBB is some of the worst software in the world. It's what got my credit card number stolen, after all.

**SECOND** EchoDitto had its big three year anniversary party on the Odyssey dinner cruise thingy, and it was as great a time as you would expect of an event with an open bar. Lots of photos `here <http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/echoboat07>`__. But the most striking image of the night was this:

It's a poster by `Jason Goad <http://www.jasongoad.com>`__ that Nicco commissioned to mark the occasion, and it's fairly completely awesome.
