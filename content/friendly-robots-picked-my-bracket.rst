Don't hate me if it works:

- `I went with the Bayesian version of the LRMC <http://www2.isye.gatech.edu/~jsokol/lrmc/about_lrmc.html>`__
- `plus some light googling to help guess the final score <http://wiki.answers.com/Q/What_is_the_average_final_score_total_for_final_div_1_NCAA_mens_basketball>`__

Next year I swear it's back to my normal system, which is based entirely on idle grudges against the denizens of College Park and an effort to elicit as much outrage from Kriston as possible.
