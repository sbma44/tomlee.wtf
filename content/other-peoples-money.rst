Before the global economy ended and the dollar recovered, there was a lot of talk about why our currency had begun performing so poorly relative to the `Euro <http://www.x-rates.com/d/EUR/USD/hist2008.html>`__ and the `British Pound <http://www.x-rates.com/d/GBP/USD/hist2008.html>`__. Too often ignored in these discussions: how much suckier our currency is. You can hardly blame people for wanting it less.

For example: `this is awesome <http://www.creativereview.co.uk/crblog/designs-on-your-money/>`__; `this is even awesomer <http://pythonide.blogspot.com/2008/10/how-to-make-money-with-free-software.html>`__. `These, though <http://www.usmint.gov/mint_programs/$1coin/index.cfm>`__? The best thing you can say for these designs is that the implied alternate history in which all US Presidents were zombies is kind of a funny idea.
