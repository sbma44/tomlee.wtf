Like everyone else I just finished watching the Sopranos finale. Judging by the reaction among the folks I was watching with, opinions vary on exactly what the ending meant. I feel pretty strongly that Tony got popped. The cut to black occurred in the instant when Tony died.

Otherwise, what's the explanation for the final scene? A slice of Tony's life before life goes on? Nah. That makes no sense. The camera following Meadow was there to put us in the moment and make us start thinking about each shot as an immediate document of what was occurring at that instant. Otherwise it would've been wasted time in an obviously important sequence. And why would the camera have followed the guy in the gray jacket? Just to distract us during the culmination of the series?

No, Tony's gotta be dead. In `Kriston's comments <http://grammarpolice.net/archives/001334.php>`__ I mentioned that I thought Tony getting killed by a random, unknown killer was a possibility, and that it wouldn't be satisfying. But I was wrong — it was a good ending. It served nicely to underscore what I consider to be one of the series' central ideas: that violence is available to every living creature at every moment, despite all our fancy institutions, customs and frontal lobes. Those things just make its application a little more complicated.

The episode felt rushed as I watched it, but in retrospect cramming so much in makes sense. We had to be lulled into thinking everything was fine, proceeding as normal — that Tony might get prosecuted, or not, but generally continue to go about the business of a depressed Jersey mobster as defined by the past six seasons. I was even lulled into expecting a happy ending! But they pulled the rug out instead. I had expected something different, but I'm not sure what — or whether it could've been any better.

**UPDATE:** There's a pretty good discussion of the ending over in `Matt's comments <http://matthewyglesias.theatlantic.com/archives/2007/06/more_sopranos_blogging.php>`__. There are a bunch of folks interpreting the ending as intentionally ambiguous — a statement about Tony being condemned to live in perpetual suspense — but I don't really buy them. The camera laid things out in a pretty straightforward manner, I think. And my memory may be shaky, but I recall Tony being pretty relaxed in the final scene.

**ALLIES:** Ezra's commenters `seem to mostly agree with the Tony-got-whacked hypothesis <http://ezraklein.typepad.com/blog/2007/06/sopranos_finale.html>`__, and have some interesting theories about the episode title. More proof that the progressive blogosphere needs the fresh, objective eyes of a new generation and not the jaded establishment cabal represented by Yglesias and his ilk.

**WHILE I'M AT IT:** John From Cincinnati was really abysmal. I was predisposed to dislike it sheerly on the basis of how hard it is to spell — the content of the show didn't do much to invalidate that prejudice. It came off as an SNL parody of a typical HBO drama: a troubled family in a quirky subculture; mannered, unrealistic characters who speak exclusively in non sequiturs, expository dialogue or profound-sounding riddles; a dash of magical realism; and, of course, the requisite heroin addict. I do like watching people surf, but Charles already owns *Blue Crush* on DVD. I'll probably still watch the next few episodes though, if only because changing channels is hard (and mostly fruitless on Sunday nights).
