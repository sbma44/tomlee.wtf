I heard this on WOXY and liked it, despite WOXY being unusually sucky today (Nickel Creek!? WTF?):

   `Love Like Fire – Unlighted Shadow <http://www.lovelikefire.com/mp3/unlighted-shadow.mp3>`__

They're streaming the `entire EP <http://www.lovelikefire.com/music.php>`__ over at their website. And they're using the XSPF player to do so, which means that `command line trickiness <http://www.manifestdensity.net/2007/07/27/command_line_rock/>`__ could be employed to grab the whole thing, if you were so inclined.
