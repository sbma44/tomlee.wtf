It was a busy weekend, one filled with baseball-watching, party attendance, delicious kitchen adventures, `videogame <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zack_and_wiki>`__ `acquisition <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassin%27s_creed>`__ and a screening of the better part of `D.E.B.S. <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D.E.B.S._(2004_film)>`__ thanks to `Logo <http://www.logoonline.com/>`__ (they're sexy female high-school-aged assassins who can't be stopped — except, perhaps, by the charms of equally sexy arch-villainess Lucy Diamond). But along the way I also managed to conquer my technical problem du jour: getting transparent proxying with URL rewriting working under OpenWRT.

Those interested can read about the associated trials and tribulations `here <http://labs.echoditto.com/proxy-based-mischief-with-openwrt>`__ — it proved to be a just-tough-enough nut to crack. Those not interested can `click here <http://ex-parrot.com/~pete/upside-down-ternet.html>`__ and scroll down to see how this particular technical configuration can be put to mildly hilarious ends. All in all a pretty satisfying experience, and one that's left me considerably less intimidated and more impressed with `OpenWRT <http://openwrt.org>`__ than I expected to be. One weekend is about the right amount of time for a geeky challenge.
