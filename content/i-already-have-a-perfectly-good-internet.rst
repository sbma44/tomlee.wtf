`God <http://outtamindouttasite.typepad.com/outtasite/2007/03/why_facebook_is.html>`__ `dammit <http://blogstretch.blogspot.com/2007/03/i-caved.html>`__, I don't *want* to join Facebook. I mean, yes, I have `a profile <http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=706410178>`__. But as you may be able to tell from the listed interests, it's not much of a serious effort. I've been mildly horrified to see friend requests begin to roll in from people I know.

I just don't see the point. What's it supposed to do? Keep me `up to date <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rss>`__ on my friends' activities? Let me `post photos <http://flickr.com>`__? Or `share links <http://del.icio.us>`__? Get `mobile updates <http://twitter.com>`__? `Plan <http://www.evite.com>`__ `events <http://www.upcoming.org>`__? Bah! I've already got technologies that I use for all this stuff. There's no reason to reroute all that activity through the blue & white blandness of a `cocky <http://www.google.com/search?q=%22a%20Mark%20Zuckerberg%20production%22>`__ `thief <http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=502722>`__.

Alright, that's a little disingenuous. I can think of one reason: now that folks use the internet professionally, they probably now want to retreat into a lower-stakes setting. I guess I can understand that. But it still seems like a pain in the ass, and the idea of "poking" and giving $1 virtual gifts sends me into a blind rage.

**UPDATE:** I guess I should finish the point I intended to make. One of the things that Matt "Wordpress" Mullenweg said during his presentation at SXSW was that he foresaw the future of personalized online presences being grounded in individual online sites, not gigantic networks like Facebook and Myspace. Obviously he's got a vested interest in pushing this vision, but I agree with him: the big networks won't last forever. Right now they can offer ease-of-use and a critical mass of users that makes finding your friends easy. But they don't have a monopoly on the former (Wordpress and blogger are great counterexamples) and userbase size isn't an advantage that lasts forever — ask Friendster. The fad value of these sites will force the market to perpetually refactor itself, fragmenting a little more each time.

The logical end point is for everyone to be running their own relatively-open site, free from the shadow of corporate hosts. Open formats will let your site talk to everybody else's, keeping you apprised of what your friends are up to. It'll be great.

In fact, it already IS great, since our little bloggy universe already uses these technologies across our constellation of personal sites. That's why I think Facebook adoption is silly: it's a step backward.

With all of that said, I don't want to let pig-headedness cut me out of connectivity — I'm sure I'll put in a mild Facebook effort. But does it really not have RSS feeds?
