Earlier tonight I was tuned to the Food Network, watching Emeril trudge mirthlessly toward whatever release it is that he has in mind (syndication? retirement? death?). Inevitably, the program cut to commercial. I was presented with a spot encouraging me to sign up for a Health Savings Account. There are savings to be had, apparently! They even had a former Bush administration official on hand to attest to this fact.

`This <http://hsainsights.com/>`__ is the website they were promoting. But I had a strangely hard time finding it just now, having forgotten the exact URL in the whiskey-filled hours between. Googling "HSA insight" didn't turn up anything. They haven't bought any Google Adwords. `hsainsight.com <http://hsainsight.com/>`__ is a parked domain. And the commercial itself was kind of cheap-looking and lame. Overall, it seems to be an awfully amateurish production.

So I'm confused. I thought that HSAs were being peddled by dishonest but well-funded rightwing ideologues anxious to have our health insurance system's collective principal shuttled over to Wall Street for a quick one-time windfall (our nation's hedge fund managers' yachts are dangerously tasteful, after all). I expect them to have tons of cash on hand to help them achieve this goal.

But the half-assed nature of this campaign has turned everything on its head. Suddenly it looks like health savings accounts aren't the risky, underclass-bilking investment vehicle that my favorite commentators had led me to believe. Apparently the HSA pimps couldn't even afford `Billy Mays <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Mays>`__! So what gives?
