Two things I enjoyed reading over the weekend:

- Ryan's `thoughtful post <http://www.dcist.com/2007/06/10/crime.php>`__ on summer crime and economic development
- The City Paper's `Letters From an Arsonist <http://washingtoncitypaper.com/display.php?id=1641>`__ story, pointed out to me by Nicco — it's a really excellent article
