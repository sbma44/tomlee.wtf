Thanks to the Governess for `reminding me <http://pygmalioninablanket.blogspot.com/2007/08/music-writersfamily-values.html>`__ that today is Elvis Death Day. Don't forget the accompanying Washington tradition: the `Don and Mike <http://www.donandmikewebsite.com/main.shtml>`__ Elvis Death Day Show.

I know it's shameful to be a shock jock apologist. But these are DC's homegrown shock jocks — I grew up listening to them, way back when they manned the morning show on a pre-Christian WAVA. I'll probably always have a soft spot for them, regardless of how vile and unfunny they can occasionally be. Besides, whatever your opinion of their daily show, there's really no better place to hear just what a weird dude Elvis Aaron Presley was on an annual basis. 3pm at the link above.

**UPDATE:** The podcast of the show is now `available on iTunes <itms://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=114454618>`__. It'll scroll into oblivion soon, so if you're interested in hearing about Elvis's weird sexual habits and astounding pharmaceutical intake, act now!
