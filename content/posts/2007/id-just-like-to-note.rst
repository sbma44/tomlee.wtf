Traditional sources of diamonds (aka "diamonds for suckers"):

| |vulcan's forge|
| |blood diamonds|

`Where my friend Jeff gets his diamonds (aka THE FUTURE) <http://www.jeffnye.org/adventures/2007/04/things_formed_in_the_crucible.php>`__:

|science!|

That's pretty great. On a related note, if you didn't see it when it first ran, go check out `Wired's article on artificial diamonds <http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.09/diamond.html>`__. Some of the entrepreneurs quoted in the piece were actually in hiding because they thought DeBeers might come and *kill them*. Awesome. Maybe that's why the scientists in the photo above are all either floating safely out of harm's way or have their heads ensconced in pressurized chambers.
