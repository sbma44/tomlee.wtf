Boi/ngBoi/ng took an `ride <http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/boingboing/iBag/~3/142187317/getting_high_with_ri.html>`__ on Richard Branson's new airline and had a great time. Suddenly I wish I had a reason to fly somewhere — I suppose `living vicariously through Jeff <http://www.jeffnye.org/adventures/2007/07/the_gift_of_flight_1.php>`__ will have to do.

But the other, more powerful sensation stirred by the BB post is this: holy hell but I'm glad Xe/ni Jar/din isn't on my IM contact list.

Perhaps I should add for the benefit of any normal humans reading: the "sl" in her last IM stands for "Second Life". Yes, it's that bad.
