Alright, so there haven't been any *particularly* noteworthy hijinks so far. That's okay. I feel relaxed, loaded up on vitamin D, and as if creativity is beginning to seep back into my brain. Or perhaps that's just the sensation of the juniper deposits left by all the gin.

It's a little hard to see, but this is a dead pufferfish. Evolution has graced him with highly effective camouflage, allowing him to trick his prey into stepping on him, then cursing.
