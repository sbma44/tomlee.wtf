Off Seventh's got `video <http://www.offseventh.org/blog/2007/04/doris_cancellin.html>`__ of the farce that went down at the latest Shaw ANC meeting — prohibitions on recording, rule-breaking, and finally the cancellation of the meeting by fiat. It's not the most rigorous application of Robert's Rules of Order that I've ever seen.

More `here <http://anc2c02.com/public/index.php/2007/04/04/this_meeting_has_been_cancelled_chair_do_1>`__. I'm glad these guys are fighting the good fight against the entrenched cronies who populate these councils. It looks like it must be a huge pain in the ass.
