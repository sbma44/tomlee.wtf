`Travis Morrison <http://www.travismorrison.com>`__ `talks to Stereogum <http://www.stereogum.com/archives/005271.html>`__ about music, programming, and working for the Post. Interesting to see that he's a Javascript/ASP guy. I wonder if he's worked on anything with Adrian Holovaty (probably not, given their locations, departments and languages).
