Justin has `just released <http://codesorcery.net/2007/08/09/pukka-16-released-status-bar-menu-and-spotlight/>`__ a new version of Pukka. If you use a Mac and maintain more than one del.icio.us feed — or just want to maintain your sole del.icio.us feed more easily (with, say, Spotlight integration) — you should go check it out.
