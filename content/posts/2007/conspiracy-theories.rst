A little while ago I wrote a `series of posts </2007/01/26/fighting-movable-type-comment-spam-part-1/>`__ outlining some steps that Movable Type admins can take to cut down on the comment spam they receive. I didn't promote it — I probably will later, in a different context — and it didn't receive a lot of traffic.

But it sure does get a lot of attempted spam, at least relative to all of the other entries on the site. I can only think of a few explanations:

#. The spammers are searching for anti-spam entries and specifically going after them to discredit their contents.
#. Maybe spammers search for anti-spam entries to serve as test beds for their methods.
#. Someone doesn't like me and signed me up for a list of URLs that's frequently spammed.
#. ... Or it's just random.

It's weird. Fortunately the anti-spam stuff is holding up — this morning is the first time that any got through (that I can remember, anyway), and only two comments made it before the URL rotated and it all stopped.
