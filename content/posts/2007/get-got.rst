|typo in Time|

I mostly just like this because it makes me feel better about the many times when a typo of mine has made it onto DCist. Also, it provided a handy excuse to put Photoshop CS3 through the paces (Review: it works! But it doesn't use the right style of brush cursor when you're zoomed in.).
