I've got a technical question for you. The demise of Oink and my rapidly-depleting server disk space have put me in the market for a new Bittorrent solution. I'm not up to administering a properly RAIDed box (getting it to email me when a disk fails is just too much of a pain, given the difficulty of sending mail out from a consumer ISP connection). And having a constantly-running PC fan in the living room is kind of annoying.

What I'd really like is to buy a `network-attached storage <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network-attached_storage>`__ device that has Bittorrent baked in. Something with `RAID <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAID>`__ that'd sit quietly and download stuff, and that doesn't cost too much money. There's `this thing <http://www.buy.com/prod/fantom-drives-g-force-megadisk-nas-raid-1tb-ethernet-with-shadow/q/loc/101/205541427.html>`__, which looks promising but has so-so customer reviews — folks say it's kind of loud and has flaky firmware. `This <http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822107002>`__ is a bit pricier — you have to supply the disks, and I haven't got spare SATA drives lying around — but `apparently supports BT <http://www.engadget.com/2007/06/08/qnaps-latest-bittorrent-nas-ts-109-pro-turbo-station/>`__.

I imagine there's a third option: get a cheaper, dumber RAID NAS and figure out a way to run BT on my router. It `looks like <http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=21595>`__ this is possible with a custom firmware, but perhaps only with the user-unfriendly OpenWRT. Given how little I can find online about this subject (and the fact that I've only used DD-WRT and Sveasoft before), I'm a little wary of trying it.

So what do you say, internets? Any suggestions?
