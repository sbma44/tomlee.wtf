Courtesy of a Saturday visit to the National Arboretum (or Arbotreeum, as one cellphone-using patron near us called it). It's pretty nice out there, and easy to get to on the weekend thanks to the X6 bus. In fact, it's so pleasant that you can easily forget how close you are to the Washington Times building.

They've got a bunch of plants & stuff, I guess, but my botanical photography skills are pretty poor. This seemed worth showing, though: DC's state tree. It's surprisingly non-crappy, especially compared to, say, Indiana. Now *there's* a sorry-ass tree.
