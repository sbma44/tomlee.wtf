I finally made it to a meeting. In brief: loquacious audience members ignorant of the limits of technology; presenters that were, if anything, too aware of them. But the disconnected dynamic was partly the fault of `the space <http://www.koshlandscience.org/visitor/dandp.jsp>`__, which — despite providing a "WONDERS OF SCIENCE" banner above the podium — didn't prove to be a particularly great setting.

Still, there were some interesting projects, I got pointed toward some `interesting <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing>`__ `things <http://www.lantronix.com/device-networking/embedded-device-servers/xport.html>`__, and I'll be going back.
