It's been two years, but scholars are still grappling with my revolutionary (and not at all self-serving) theory about the inevitability of women finding videogame players `totally hot <http://www.zunta.org/blog/archives/2005/03/28/the_geek_shall/>`__. Or `Susan is <http://sueandnotu.blogspot.com/2007/01/esprit-descalier.html>`__, anyway. That's one entire scholar! I think that's pretty good.

If you missed the opportunity to call me an idiot back in March '05, here's your chance to make up for lost time: grab some journal references (any will do) and head on over to Sue's `comments section <http://sueandnotu.blogspot.com/2007/01/esprit-descalier.html>`__.
