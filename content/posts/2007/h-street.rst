`Tonight <http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/172623/>`__! Charles, Aaron, Adam and Spencer! The Red and the Black! With `The Daybreak Line <http://www.myspace.com/thedaybreakline>`__! Quickly now — agree to come before my tolerance for exclamation points falters!

I really am looking forward to this. These guys have been playing together for a while now — it'll be interesting to see the evolution from their Velvet Lounge debut to tonight. Plus, Adam says they have a bunch of new material. Even if they didn't, the stuff from their band-creating LP sounds newly great since being rerecorded. I particularly like this one:

   `The City Veins – Toe The Line <http://www.thecityveins.com/music/ToeTheLine.mp3>`__

I think it's one of the best songs (and most tastefully restrained performances) I've ever heard from these guys in any of the various band incarnations they've been in. You can find more of the rerecorded album `here <http://www.thecityveins.com/blog/>`__.

Oh, and if anyone feels like joining us for dinner on H Street before the show, send me an email. Otherwise, I hope to see you at the show.
