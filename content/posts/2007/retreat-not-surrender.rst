Well, I'm back. The retreat was fun, and surprisingly useful. I'm more hostile than most when it comes to what I call team-ology — the sort of unscientific time-wasters that arise when someone takes an ex-CEO's platitudes about proactivity (or whatever else) a little too seriously. A surprisingly large number of people can be convinced that a set of `successories-style <http://www.successories.com/index.cfm/fuseaction/dir_product.brand_title_sku/product_group_id/e429709c-250d-488d-a7bb-90f537107324/brand_id/e1624976-0a99-4882-a357-9fa2471c0b4b/product_title_id/f045815b-2367-4b4a-86fd-70bd3f8012b2/product_id/6818c9b9-d30d-4419-bb21-43bcafec1d9d/page_number/1/page_sort/name/product_theme_id/e5c78b41-e1d4-4e31-9b7b-736baa0eb698/Above-Beyond.cfm>`__ cliches nested in a simply-made-up dependency tree counts as a theory of something. Ropes courses and trust falls are infinitely more useful than that sort of bullshit.

Fortunately there was surprisingly little of that stuff on the ED retreat. Most of the exercises we did were useful or led to useful conversations. Still, for sheer team-building efficacy nothing can compete with drinking beer and playing DDR:

We had almost no internet access at the site, so I've been out of touch. That's led to me being a bad blogger, contenting myself over the weekend with adding useless `Technorati widgets <http://kailashnadh.name/ducksoup/>`__ and archives to this site instead of content. I can't say that the trend of pointless but technically interesting effort is going to end anytime soon — here's a teaser for the latest `useless thing </2006/12/08/be-your-own-aronofsky/>`__ that I'm trying to do with video:

But I realize that I've been putting my few long-suffering readers through a lot of technical mumbo jumbo lately. I promise I'll try to reengage the non-robotic part of my brain sometime soon.

**UPDATE:** Here's `a workplace philosophy <http://blogs.nbcuni.com/DwightsBlog/2006/11/how_to_work_well_with_others.php>`__ that I wholeheartedly endorse (see final paragraph).
