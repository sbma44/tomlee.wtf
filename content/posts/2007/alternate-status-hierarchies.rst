I agree with everything Megan says `here <http://meganmcardle.theatlantic.com/archives/2007/08/consumer_culture.php>`__ — well, except for the Asperger's bit, which I'm `reflexively <http://www.zunta.org/blog/archives/2006/03/29/i_thought_you_g/>`__ averse to. Jason, who's `freshly back from PAX <http://www.geekstudies.org/2007/08/checking-in-from-seattle>`__, studies questions like this one in the course of his research. I'd be curious to know what he's got to say about it.
