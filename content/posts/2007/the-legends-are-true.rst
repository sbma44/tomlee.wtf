It *is* possible to see `this silhouetted figure rotating in both directions <http://www.news.com.au/perthnow/story/0,21598,22492511-5005375,00.html?from=mostpop>`__. Charles got it right away; yesterday I finally managed to as well. It seems extremely unlikely that the neuroscience claims attached to the demo mean anything. Still, it's a pretty neat optical illusion.

But I'm left wondering: did they really have to give the figure nipples?
