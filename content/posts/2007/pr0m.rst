I've always maintained that Fountains of Wayne's `"Prom Theme" <http://www.last.fm/music/Fountains+of+Wayne/_/Prom+Theme>`__ is the best possible music for 18 year-olds to slow dance to before just-barely-not-impregnating one another. But Cristen's mounting a strong challenge for prom theme supremacy, as proven by the whiteboard full of geek-related promisms that's sitting in our office (she's planning a party). My favorites so far:

- a night 2.0 remembr
- under the C++ / under the SQL
- pwnderful 2nite

If you've got any other ideas, lay 'em on me. The success of an internet/highschool-themed chug-a-thon could potentially hang in the balance!
