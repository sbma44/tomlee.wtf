This is the second goddamn time, earning it the coveted title of the worst PHP software I've encountered that isn't also a Wordpress plugin. Enough already; it's gone. JP recently pointed me toward the decidedly more reputable-seeming `PHPSurveyor <http://www.phpsurveyor.org/>`__ this week, so I guess I'll be working on a DCist template for that.

Fortunately the jerk in question didn't do a very thorough job of trashing my site: he just killed the files in directories off the top level (sparing my blog, inexplicably) and put up some triumphal pages expressing his disapproval of US/Israeli foreign policy. Even more fortunately, my host has a backup from the 15th that they're pulling for me for $15. For those of you using the full text RSS script, sorry — it was one of the victims. A new & improved version will be available soon at a different location anyway, though, so just sit tight for now.

And hey, you know the saying: God doesn't close a metasploit session without opening an interesting LUG thread. So I've got big things planned: a nightly backup to my own RAIDed SVN repository that in turn backs itself up to Amazon S3. It'll be great.
