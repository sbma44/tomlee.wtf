`This <http://www.mediabistro.com/fishbowlDC/hottest_media_types/2007_hottest_media_types_finalists_female_off_air_63534.asp>`__ is getting `weird <http://www.mediabistro.com/fishbowlDC/hottest_media_types/2007_hottest_media_types_finalists_male_off_air_63532.asp>`__.

I like how some of the shots of "off-air" talent are screencaps from on-air appearances. And how some of the contestants don't actually work in media at all. But the exclusion of certain perennial candidates is, of course, an outrage.
