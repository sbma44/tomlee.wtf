...as I reminded myself the hard way this morning. Save one little template over another one, where the latter happens to have all of your configuration constants and utility functions? Bad things happen. And no, of \*course\* I didn't have a backup. That'd be ridiculous!

I think I've resurrected everything except the Technorati functionality, but if anything seems broken I'd appreciate your letting me know.

Also, there's a new header graphic to go along with the beautiful weather outside (that's what started this mess).
