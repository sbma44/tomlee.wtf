I've pretty much completed my survey of phone options, and the news is not good. The `Ocean <http://www.helio.com/#devices_ocean>`__'s keyboard isn't very good, its browser is hopelessly neutered and it crashed twice while I was using it. The `Wing <http://t-mobile.com/shop/phones/Detail.aspx?device=acc8102d-4506-4eaa-bc2f-9c7b8ec1b1e0>`__ is junky and also crashed while I was using it — Windows Mobile seems pretty awful. The `Dash <http://t-mobile.com/shop/phones/Detail.aspx?device=f164419f-eee9-4cf6-a1bd-070dbe4b5023>`__ has some style and an okay keyboard, but the store clerks were wary of it. And although it's clear that it's probably underpowered (despite its custom edition of Windows Mobile seeming pretty snappy), it's hard to say exactly how that limitation would manifest itself. "Inconveniently" is my guess.

Besides, I really don't want to be forced to commit to two more years on America's slowest data network. The iPhone's beautiful, but if I were to spend that much money I'd want a less flaky keyboard, an SSH client and the ability to tether my laptop to it. I'm confident that software revisions (and perhaps an SDK) will make the device unassailably awesome, but for now I'm content to wait.

So yes, I'm a broken man — despite yesterday morning's wide-eyed telephonic optimism, I'm now trolling Craigslist and Ebay for used Sidekick 3s. The handset is a disappointment, to be sure: no maps, no video, no tethering, and Danger inexplicably makes their keyboards worse with every device revision. But it still offers the best keyboard out there, a fairly responsive and nearly-uncrashable operating system, and the promise of resuming normal Tom-phone activities until the iPhone pressures the market into making better devices. Here's to maintaining the status quo.
