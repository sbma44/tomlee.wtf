I got my FON router and Arduino to talk to each other, and I'm pretty excited about it. You can find the details `here <http://labs.echoditto.com/hacking-la-fonera-2>`__ if you're interested.

Put in simple terms, this lets me translate any information I can pull from the net into physical action. There are limits, of course — can I stream WOXY or play YouTube clips through an Arduino? No. It's a much simpler device than that — one that's basically capable of reading and sending a little more than a dozen low-voltage signals, and about half as many low-voltage analog signals.

But you can get a lot done with these seemingly humble capabilities. I could control appliances; I could wire it into an RC car's remote control; I could use it to open and close my garage door over the internet; I could monitor the temperature in my apartment and send myself an email if the furnace broke.

I'm aiming for something simpler to begin with: the analog display of some interesting online information, courtesy of some cool-looking gauges. If anyone's got a line on awesome-looking vintage electronic equipment that I can tear apart, please let me know.
