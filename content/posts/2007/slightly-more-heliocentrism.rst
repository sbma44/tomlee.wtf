I might have to reconsider the Ocean: `Matt <http://mstem.wordpress.com/>`__ tipped me off to the fact that some intrepid Helio users have `figured out a way to load J2ME apps on the phone <http://www.heliocity.net/2007/opera-mini-for-everybody-custom-apps-yay/>`__. The first big success is Opera Mini, an excellent web browser that can now supplant the Ocean's neutered default browser.

The advance is related to a wrapper that's been written for the platform. Lots of phones can run Java Midlets, and consequently lots of Midlets are available. But Helios can't use them. They employ a less-common Java technology called WIPI. That's the crux of the breakthrough: someone's come up with a way to wrap Midlets as WIPI apps. There are kinks to be worked out (the QWERTY keyboard on the Ocean doesn't work within Opera, for example), but this is clearly a big deal.
