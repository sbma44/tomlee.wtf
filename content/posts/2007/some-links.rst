- `Comcast claims they aren't interfering with BitTorrent despite strong evidence to the contrary <http://torrentfreak.com/comcast-wrongfully-denies-interfering-with-bittorrent/>`__. The problem apparently isn't affecting all Comcast users, and TorrentFreak says that some BT client authors are integrating workarounds into their programs. So if you're a Comcast customer perhaps you don't need to panic after all.
- `Frank Deford on pro wrestling's high mortality rate <http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=13829386>`__. It's nice to see a real sports journalist talk about wrestling and its occasionally tragic aspects without sneering. But Deford's stretching things when he tries to connect the deaths directly to steroid abuse in other sports. Yes, wrestlers' anabolically-enhanced bulk contributes to a lot of premature heart attacks. But that's just part of the story — there's also abuse of other substances among wrestlers, particularly opiates. The industry involves a lot of travel and an economic structure that encourages wrestlers to continue to work while injured. As a result a staggering number of wrestlers get addicted to painkillers at one point or another, and often other drugs as well. The lifestyle is basically that of a chemically supercharged carny. Steroid use certainly isn't healthy, but I don't think it completely explains why the wrestling industry produces so many dead men in hotel rooms.
