`Slotcars that you control by yelling into your phone <http://speeddial.cell-ular.com/>`__, thanks to `Asterisk <http://ww.asterisk.org>`__ and an `Arduino <http://www.arduino.cc>`__. Pretty neat, and somewhat similar to a project that I finished not too long ago for our office's lobby (more on that soon). I wonder how he pulls apart the SIP VoIP stream...

The creator's `other project <http://cell-ular.com/>`__ is pretty cool, too — it uses `Processing <http://www.processing.org>`__ and cameraphones and image recognition to an interesting effect. I can't figure out how the hell one uses the `mobot <http://www.mobot.com/>`__ image recognition service that he refers to, though.

**UPDATE:** Check out `this project <http://www.megaphone3000.com/>`__, too, from the `same show <http://itp.nyu.edu/show/results.php?sortby=class>`__. With the number of bars and clubs that have prominent video displays, the low cost of the software (and VoIP service) and the ubiquity of cell phones, I really think a fun business could be made out of creating and selling machines that offer this kind of ad-hoc head-to-head gaming. I know I'd enjoy watching a projection of a few people play a game of Bomberman while waiting for the next band set up at a 9:30 show. Maybe the winner gets some money off his tab — it'd be great.
