From the bizarre opening `production company logo <http://www.showbox.co.kr/>`__ to the moment in the climactic battle when the dragon goes through puberty, that was just about everything that one could ask for from a Korean dragon-versus-dragon movie. Along with awesome CGI and memorable catchphrases ("What are you talking about?"; "That doesn't make any sense"), it boasted the most convoluted plot in a movie of Asian provenance that I've witnessed since my third viewing of *Ninja Scroll* revealed that the elite team of ninja monsters who poisoned the village's well did so in order to manipulate gold prices in a bid to destabilize the Tokugawa Shogunate. The fiends!

The actual dragon-on-dragon violence occurred in a modern-day Los Angeles where Americans spend most of their time brandishing guns and familiarizing themselves with obscure aspects of Korean culture. Sommer was at the football game, so I haven't yet been able to ask whether this constitutes a creative liberty. Either way, it won't diminish the reptilian awesomeness contained in D-War. I don't know if South Korean movies make it to the north end of the DMZ, but if they do I bet Kim Jong-Il is kicking himself for trading away his nuclear ambitions. Fuel oil isn't going to do squat against an angry Imoogi desperate for Yuh Yi Joo.
