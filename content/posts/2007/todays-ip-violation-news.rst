Suddenly there are all kinds of things going on in the world of filesharing:

- Oink.me.uk, the incredibly comprehensive BT music site, isn't down, it's just `experiencing DNS issues <http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Torrentfreak/~3/129433734/>`__. Some folks thought the legal hammer had come down on them, particularly since some other high profile sites (most notably Demonoid) have recently gotten the axe. Not so; if you need to, you can still access the site by its IP using information at the above link.
- AllOfMP3, the quasi-legal bulk MP3 site that traded off a loophole in Russian copyright law, `appears to be dead <http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/boingboing/iBag/~3/129852366/allofmp3com_finally_.html>`__, a casualty of Russia's stepped-up efforts to comply with international IP treaties. However it's already sprung up under a new name — MP3Sparks — and brought over customers' accounts and balances. I've successfully used AllOfMP3 in the past and been pleased with the experience. Better still, I haven't been murdered or sold into slavery by the Russian mafia. All in all, a better experience than anticipated.
- `Universal is pulling their music off of iTunes <http://apple.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/07/02/1642242&from=rss>`__, or at least threatening to. Folks are speculating that this is because Apple has been unwilling to budge on various issues, the most notable being the 99 cent pricing for songs.

And finally, TorrentFreak `notes <http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Torrentfreak/~3/128633142/>`__ that the `Pirate Bay <http://www.piratebay.org>`__ is responsible for 50% of all BT traffic, which is fairly astounding.
