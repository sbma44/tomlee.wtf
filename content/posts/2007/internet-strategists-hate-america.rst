In response to my last post a much-better-informed little birdy sent me a transcript of a Homeland Security Committee hearing about online Islamic extremism. It was an interesting read, and I may say something else about it later. But for now, here's the part that was most immediately striking:

   | In an effort to raise its
   | visibility and recruit new members... an Iraqi
   | insurgent group held a website design contest open to anyone in the world with
   | an Internet connection. And what was the prize given to the winner of that contest? The opportunity to launch a rocket attack against American forces in Iraq with just the click of
   | the mouse from the winner's computer.

It's inhuman and morally outrageous, yes. But *man*, that's a pretty good idea for an online contest. If you could just tone down the evil you might really have something there.
