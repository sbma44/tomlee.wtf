#. I need to wriggle out of my T-Mobile contract. Well, one of them: I long ago escaped the one associated with my Sidekick, but I bought a separate number for DCist's LastCall service. LastCall's currently shut down due to some technical problems, and if I resurrect it I'd want to use a different SMS gateway. But I've still got over a year left on the contract.
   Of course, there's a $200 early termination fee associated with quitting now. Bad. But T-Mobile has announced an SMS rate increase, which constitutes a contract change, which lets customers quit for free! Good! But I have unlimited SMS, so I don't qualify. Back to bad. Now I have to keep calling their CSRs until I get one that's especially sweet and/or confused.
   I suppose I should feel guilty about my planned deceit, but I didn't get a handset when I signed up, and the ETF is largely in place to ensure that people don't get subsidized phones and then quit the service before the money's earned back. So my conscience is clear — it's just the sweet-talking that I'm dreading. Sage advice on this point would be appreciated.
#. I'm with Julian on `this <http://juliansanchez.com/notes/archives/2007/05/was_this_article_written_by_a.php>`__: two dollars per cocktail seems very high. I am, I know, out of the mainstream when it comes to bar tipping: I've never really understood why bartenders are the best-compensated wait staff in a bar or restaurant when their jobs also seem to be the easiest and most fun. Besides, applying the same percentage (or higher) tip as when dining makes no sense: for drinks, the amount of effort the server has to invest in serving you is much smaller relative to the value of the total transaction (and therefore the tip) — the customer has to line up and wait to be served, there's generally no follow-up attention paid by the bartender, and less knowledge of the menu is required.
   I suppose I feel this way because I prefer to drink cheap beer in dive bars. At Southwark a dollar tip per drink seems low — the gentleman on the other side of the bar prepared the beverage with such diligence, made such friendly, intelligent conversation and generally took such good care of me that it'd be incredibly crass not to tip generously in gratitude. But being expected to cough up a dollar per popped-top on $4 cans of Schlitz at DC9? I donno, man. Seems kinda dumb.
