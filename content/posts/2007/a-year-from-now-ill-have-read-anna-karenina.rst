Has `DailyLit <http://www.dailylit.com/index>`__ made the rounds yet? If it has, I must've missed it. My friend Chris sent me the link — it's a pretty neat idea. Pick from a list of public-domain works and have a daily installment of approachable size delivered to your inbox or RSS reader. If you've got time or the inclination to read the next one you can click on a link embedded in the entry — it'll send you the next one right away. Cool.

My tendency to pointlessly refresh my RSS reader rather than pick up a book and engage with it is downright sad — maybe this'll harness my bad habits for good.
