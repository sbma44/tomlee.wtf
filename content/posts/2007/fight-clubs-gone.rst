`Bummer <http://washingtoncitypaper.com/display.php?id=1141>`__. It was only two blocks from my house, but I only went there once, for an incredibly awesome Halloween party in 2005. I didn't really know anyone there beside the folks I came with, and there were beer-related difficulties — we didn't stick around very long. But it was still extremely cool, and one of the most un-DC parties I've ever been to in this town.

I was definitely an outsider there, but I was still really glad to know that a scene like it existed. Hopefully it's being recreated somewhere else even as I write this — judging by the City Paper article I'd say it probably is. It seems unlikely that the folks running Fight Club would spontaneously disassemble their social hub unless they had another option available.

At any rate, the photos and video I took that night are below.
