Saturday night was astoundingly great. Earlier in the week Josh asked me if I might like to dress up like a superhero and stand around an Arlington TV studio for a few hours. Clearly the answer was yes.

So two nights ago Emily and I joined Josh and Lindsay at Galaxy Hut before heading a few doors down to `channel 69 <http://www.arlingtonmedia.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=12&Itemid=257>`__ to be extras in the next episode of `Defenders of Stan <http://channel102.net/show.php?show=88>`__.

Getting a bunch of people dressed up like superheroes is an excellent way to start an evening. And Arlington's small-world tendencies made the evening even better: `Hemal <http://dcist.com/staff.php#hemal>`__ and her sister Payal were there, and I was pleasantly surprised to see `HT <http://www.thelegwarmers.com/jr.asp>`__ in a jaunty cape — I've known the guy off and on since taking computer classes at the Career Center together, where he and I acquired the advanced Applesoft BASIC skills that eventually led him to work with my friend `Jon <http://www.mp3.com/users/Jon47/profile.php>`__. Like I said, Arlington's a small world. A small, inbred world.

The shoot was pretty fun, particularly since Josh made an in-costume run to Whole Foods for beer. After things wrapped up we tried to head back to Galaxy Hut, but they looked a little crowded and were charging a cover. So Josh continued his streak of real-life heroism and drove us all into the city to meet up with folks at Townhouse. I stopped taking photos at that point; Kriston's photostream `picks up <http://flickr.com/photos/cappseus/395804032/>`__ the `story <http://flickr.com/photos/cappseus/395803956/>`__ from there.

But here are the shots I did get:
