On the way into work this morning I saw a large, gaily-decorated RV with nurses inside of it. It was, of course, a blood donation van — a bloodmobile. More specifically, it was the Children's Bloodmobile:

I had always assumed that the "Children's" in the title stood for `Children's Hospital <http://www.dcchildrens.com/>`__. But if that's the case, is it just coincidence that the bloodmobile was parked outside of `a K-12 charter school <http://www.sailpcs.org/>`__?

Is that "children's" a proper noun or an adjective? It might be time to read up on how charter schools get their funding.
