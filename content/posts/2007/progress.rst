As you may recall, I have something of an ongoing quest to amass as many unpleasantly geeky traits as possible, in order to get a head start on horrifying any teenage offspring that my distant future may hold. A selection from the current list of accomplishments:

- extensive soldering iron evangelism
- familiarity with both Palladium and TSR roleplaying game systems, including the ability to ruminate at length on the relative utility of twelve-sided die versus a d100
- computers: I like 'em!
- near-total incompetence at all team sports
- and of course, the backgrounds in videogames and comics that are de rigeur for a male of my generation

There are a few glaring omissions: I've never played a collectible card game like Magic: The Gathering; I've never been to a sci-fi convention or Renaissance Faire (although I think I deserve partial credit for attending multiple computer shows); and I have, in fact, seen a girl naked (not sure what to do about that one).

Still, I'm pleased to announce additional progress. Yesterday I received a package containing the first truly dorky board game that I've owned. And when I say truly dorky, I mean it — this isn't some Risk bullshit. Captains of football teams play Risk! No, this is a different sort of thing all together.

Jeff introduced me to the genre when he came home for Christmas, bringing the game `Puerto Rico <http://www.riograndegames.com/>`__ with him. I found it immediately appealing: its tendency to facilitate offensive jokes about colonialism and capacity for screwing over your fellow man made it a lot of fun. Then when I visited Jeff in California this spring we played `Power Grid <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Grid_(board_game)>`__, which I liked even more (and which, with its economically-oriented gameplay elements, seemed like it would be enjoyable to a lot of people I know).

But Jeff convinced me that I'd be better served by starting off with a simpler game. So I bought `Carcassonne <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcassonne_%28board_game%29>`__, which is considered a prototypical example of this so-called `German-style board game <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German-style_board_game>`__ (presumably because the game revolves around divvying up real estate in France).

Some of you have probably heard of or even played it before — the only game from this genre that's better-known is `Settlers of Catan <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settlers_of_Catan>`__, which is popular enough to have `shown up on Xbox Live <http://www.penny-arcade.com/2007/05/04>`__. But Carcassonne was new to me when `Charles <http://dccharles.blogspot.com>`__ and I gave it a try last night. The verdict: pretty fun!

But I can already feel the hunger growing — this one won't keep me satisfied for long. I need more tiles! More complex rules! More numerous and varied bits of varnished wood to lose under the couch! Things could get ugly before it's all over.
