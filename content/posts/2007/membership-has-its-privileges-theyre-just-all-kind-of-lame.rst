Oh christ. Charles has just `pointed <http://dccharles.blogspot.com/2007/07/first-i-would-like-to-thank-everyone.html>`__ me to "`The Space <http://www.thespace-dc.com/membership.htm>`__", a members-only club that seems to be sinking its roots into the neighborhood. Be sure to check out their `services <http://www.thespace-dc.com/membership.htm>`__ and `application <http://www.thespace-dc.com/membershipapplication.pdf>`__, which asks for a credit card number and signed agreement to abide by the club rules without actually listing what the fees or rules (or even address) are.

Then, head over to the entrepreneurs' bios on `this page <http://www.international-lifestyles.com/about_us.htm>`__ and laugh at my impending doom:

   | Five years as a rugby player triggered my interest in world travel.
   | Thatâ€™s how I met my wife, Karen. When we settled down in Washington, our mutual passion for real estate investment kept us exploring. Adams Morgan, Arlington, Georgetown—we got to know all of the areaâ€™s fascinating and unique neighborhoods.

So cosmopolitan! Edgy, too — I `hear <http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/display.php?id=2008>`__ Adams Morgan is kind of a rough neighborhood.

With the Warehouse in trouble, this neighborhood actually does need some general-purpose space for art, music and events. But "International Lifestyles" aren't going to attract their allegedly-desired artistic class by setting up a guest list and throwing on a Thievery Corporation mix CD. Here's hoping this carriage house quickly reverts to something half as useful as the car repair shop it used to be.
