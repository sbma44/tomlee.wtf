Well, it was a beautiful weekend in Cazenovia — a fun wedding, a relaxing and productive couple of days after, and a nice time all around. Unfortunately, it seems that during the first twenty-some years of my life I was unknowingly using up my lifetime allotment of air travel karma. I can no longer set foot in an airport without some sort of travel apocalypse unfolding. If I checked bags I'd probably be dead by now.

Otherwise: work, busy, etc. I really need some sort of system to crawl out from under September. `Inbox Zero <http://www.43folders.com/izero/>`__ might be a little ambitious, though. For now I'd settle for RSS Reader One Thousand.

I don't mean to just whine, though — things aren't all bleak. For instance, I'm continuing to make strides in the `struggle for the fair treatment of Espers <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_fantasy_vi>`__. In fact, let me take this opportunity to announce that I believe we've reached an accord with the Empire! It's a momentous achievement, to be sure.

Admittedly, there are some alarmists on the internet who warn of an impending ecological disaster that could result in a floating and/or abruptly-not-floating continent. However, I remain confident that such doomsaying is wholly unfounded (although the issue does merit more study).
