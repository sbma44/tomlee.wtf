Ladies and gentlemen, the Porters. We're freshly back from Andy and Lee Ann's wedding in lovely Winchester, Va. The bride was radiant, the groom was handsome, and no fights broke out. Well, `almost <http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/757216202/>`__ no fights.

This wedding is sort of a milestone for my group of friends, I suppose. It's certainly not the first, but I think it is the first that didn't owe part of its timing to a pending deployment to Afghanistan, an INS scam or a raging Mormon libido. Not that those aren't all fine reasons to push up the date of nuptuals, but none of them apply to me, particularly. As far as I could see, though, this whole operation was uncoerced! Weird.

A `beautiful setting <http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/757253254/>`__ and an awesome band made for a fun reception. Then everyone came back to the hotel and got drunk in our room, which was also pretty great. And about an hour ago I wrapped things up by buying an ionic air purifier off the registry: an electronic gadget the coolness of which is only outstripped by its potential uselessness. It's exactly the sort of gift I'd like to be associated with, and a storybook ending to the weekend. I hope it brings them many a happy ion.
