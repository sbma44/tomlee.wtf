It took me a hell of a long time to get around to fixing the problem with the circuit, but I finally got my Arduino relay interface/magic extension cord working — thanks in no small part to the `help <http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/340044058/>`__ of a `kind stranger <http://www.flickr.com/photos/11328208@N00/>`__ who happened across my Flickr photostream.

I wrote it up a bit more over at `labs <http://labs.echoditto.com/arduino-relay>`__ — head there if you want more ruminations on the subject. But if you don't want the full account, just check out the video below and take quiet satisfaction from my hypocritical descent into vlogging.
