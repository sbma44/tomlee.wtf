muslix64 has `some responses <http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?p=924730#post924730>`__ to what people have been saying about his work cracking the HD-DVD copy protection scheme. In short, he thinks insecure software players will continue to exist, and will be used by crackers to extract and distribute volume keys, which are the keys specific to different titles, and which can't be revoked by the central AACS authority. You'll have to acquire a volume key before ripping a DVD and uploading it to the Bittorrent networks, but at just a few KB of (now easily-obtained) data, that shouldn't pose a significant barrier to pirates' efforts. And of course, once one unprotected copy is on the net, the jig is up...
