|Crime!|

Today started off on an exciting note, with police sirens screeching and officers screaming at a couple of gentlemen about 150 feet from my bedroom window. "Get down and put your hands up!" seemed to be the core message, but the officers tried out a number of different variations (consistent delivery, though). My real camera's battery had run down, so this is the best picture I could manage; you'll have to take my word for the fact that it was kind of awesome (or at least loud).
