The dust has settled, and `this <http://hypem.com/hype_coming_soon.html>`__ is the only internet April Fool's joke I've seen that seemed genuinely funny — it nicely takes advantage of paranoia users have about the site itself and is well-executed, slipping the outlandishness in early then playing it (mostly) straight until a final sly jab at the end. Good job, Hype Machine.

`Gmail Paper <http://mail.google.com/mail/help/paper/more.html>`__ was alright, too, but it didn't seem like a knockout to me.

But maybe I'm just being cranky. I'm pretty down on internet April Fool's jokes in general — they're usually pretty tin-eared, predictable and dumb, and there are far too many of them. To see just how incredibly awful things can get you only need to check out the `April 1 edition of Slashdot <http://slashdot.org/index.pl?issue=20070401>`__.
