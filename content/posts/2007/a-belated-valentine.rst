I haven't put anything up since then, but better late than never: thanks to everyone who came out to Unbuckled on Thursday, especially those who bought me birthday drinks. I can't think of any way I would've rather celebrated — it was great.

And thanks & congratulations to Kyle and Amanda for putting the concert together. I'm consistently amazed that people I know manage to put together such great rock shows. Their ability to identify bands at the sweet spot between popularity and bookability; get people in the door; make them feel like they got their money's worth; and have the bands leave happy — well, it's impressive. And for sub-$10 shows, it's surprisingly rare.
