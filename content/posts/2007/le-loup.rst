`Another solid DC band <http://www.brightestyoungthings.com/svetlana/music/signings-of-spring-georgie-james-saddles-up/>`__! Color me pleased. Check out their attractively-designed site `here <http://leloupmusic.net>`__ or their MySpace page `here <http://myspace.com/leloupmusic>`__. And if you're sad to be limited to the three songs... well, there's practically nothing that the command line can't solve these days...

   ::

      for((i=1;i<=10;i+=1)); do
      printf "%02d" $i | xargs -I {} wget http://leloupmusic.net/BIRDS/music/{}.mp3
      done

Be forewarned: it's only 64kbps.
