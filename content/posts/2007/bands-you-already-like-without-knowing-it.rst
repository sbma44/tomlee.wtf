For all I know both of these bands may be blogospheric old news by now. But I'm really enjoying them, so here you go.

Do you like Architecture In Helskini but wish they were brattier, catchier and more British? Of course you do. So you'd better listen to this:

   `Los Campesinos – You! Me! Dancing! <http://www.nothingbutgreenlights.net.nyud.net:8080/mp3/Los%20Campesinos%20-%20You!%20Me!%20Dancing!.mp3>`__

And if you like Summerteeth-era Wilco, check out `The Swimmers <http://www.theswimmers.com/>`__:

   `The Swimmers – It's Time They Knew <http://www.theswimmers.com.nyud.net:8080/fightingtreesmp3/01_ItsTimeTheyKnew.mp3>`__

**UPDATE:** Fixed the link to the Swimmers mp3.
