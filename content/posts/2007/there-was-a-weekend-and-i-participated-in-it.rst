- On Saturday Emily and I (mostly Emily) made `pretzels <http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/2006479840/>`__ and `cheese biscuits <http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/2006499530/>`__, then headed over to `Jason <http://www.doombot.com>`__ & Lee's to participate in their bake-off. I'm pretty sure I ate five different types of pie, then spent the rest of the night alternating between picking Spree off of a gingerbread house and complaining about what an awful candy Spree is. Overall: delicious, but incapacitating.
- After a Sunday morning train ride home, `Charles <http://www.thecityveins.com/blog>`__ was nice enough to bring me along to the Redskins game. On the way to the stadium our Metro car's brakes malfunctioned, filling the air with a smell so acrid that it made my eyes water and almost certainly gave me lung cancer. Yet somehow the Redskins managed to make a painful, wasting death look comparatively good. God, what a sucky football team. Still, the Philadelphia Eagles remain the worst team in football, at least morally speaking.
- Yesterday I went swimming, and *man* am I bad at it. Forget the flailing and gasping for breath; it's the kicking that really gives me trouble. It's not that I can't do it — I don't sink and I'm a lot faster than the old guys, at least. But somehow my knee is now more sore than if I'd just run on the damn thing, making me think that my mechanics leave something to be desired. No-impact my ass.
- Then I drove down to Louisa to have dinner with my mom, which turns out to be a good way to come back from a holiday weekend feeling exhausted. Thanksgiving now, please.
