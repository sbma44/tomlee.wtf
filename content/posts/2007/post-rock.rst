Well, that was a hell of a success. Charles, Aaron, Adam and Spencer sounded great — amazingly so, considering that this was their first gig. Admittedly, all but the last of these guys have known each other forever and have some experience playing together. But Spencer's the drummer, and dropping in a new rhythm section is no mean feat. They couldn't have practiced more than a half dozen times as a full band, but you wouldn't have known it from listening to 'em. It was a great debut.

Part of the credit has to go to the Velvet Lounge, whose resident sound guy has a reputation for being the only U Street audio engineer that consistently gives a damn. But part & parcel with that is the undeniable loudness of the tiny space. So if you're feeling old and hearing-damaged, head over to `Shelley Batts' place <http://scienceblogs.com/retrospectacle/2007/04/ear_plugs_ear_plugs_and_yes_mo.php>`__. She's got some `scientific recommendations <http://scienceblogs.com/retrospectacle/2006/07/taking_aspirin_after_noise_pro.php>`__ for protecting your hearing. The short version: take some aspirin or vitamin E after a loud show. And, if at all possible, be African American.
