Over the weekend I briefly considered writing a FaceBot to take the reins of my completely-neglected FaceBook account. I have no interest in logging in and grappling with my acquaintances' neverending lycanthropic demands. But it shouldn't be too hard to write a script that does, thereby proving that I exist as a social entity. For an extra layer of authenticity the bot would watch the RSS coming out of Google News and periodically create a new group with a title like "WE WILL NEVER FORGET YOU Musharraf Declares Martial Law".

The possibilities were endless. But then I remembered that I'm supposed to be doing a million other things, several of them arguably more important.

Besides, I'm growing convinced that Flickr's already implemented this sort of breakthrough technology. Check out these comments, all of which I've received in the last week:
