I almost forgot: a little birdy tells me that you can find a full-text version of the `recently-bowdlerized Freakonomics RSS feed <http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/08/22/the-last-word-for-now-on-our-rss-feed-an-excruciatingly-long-and-boring-post-that-will-please-exactly-no-one/>`__ at the following URL.

At the moment, the authors are asking a very good question: `why are we eating so much more shrimp than we used to <http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/08/27/why-are-we-eating-so-much-shrimp/>`__? Shrimp just isn't very good relative to other seafood. But it's *everywhere*.

Being the sort of blog that it is, I'm sure that the answer will be "because aquaculture and/or other factors have made the margins on shrimp much better". I think the other half of the answer, likely to remain unblogged elsewhere, is that Americans are squeamish about seafood that tastes like seafood, and you can't order chicken *every* time you go to Applebee's.
