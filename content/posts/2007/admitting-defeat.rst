|the American Quarterhorse Association?|\ I had a dream, and a beautiful one at that: I wanted to stop opening my mail.

Mail is terrible. In my experience it's uniformly either irrelevant or bad news. Mostly it's the former, of course: American Express seems to feel they need to check in with me about four times a week, and various bafflingly unfamiliar organizations keep trying to push credit cards on me (at right: The American Quarter Horse Association's offer, received just a few hours before I wrote this).

The important stuff — which is, of course, indistinguishable from the junk — is always, always bad news. Mostly it's bills. Sometimes it's a coded warning that in several months I'll almost forget to buy a wedding present for someone. The best case scenario is that I've merely slid a little further into emotional debt to a faithfully corresponding family member. Good news arrives electronically. Duties are printed on paper, like military orders.

I tried to at least dispense with the bills. Bank of America made it seem like I could plausibly receive and pay bills online. When they added a feature that allowed me to automatically respond to incoming bills — no attention or volition required! — I enthusiastically handed my checkbook over to a robot. I spent the last 8 months or so throwing away every communication that looked even a little bit like it was from a credit card company. Sometimes I'd tear them up (identity thieves lurk everywhere!) but it was more satisfying to shove their evil, glossy bulk straight into the trash can. It was a wonderful time in my life. I felt free.

Sadly, I'm now putting my shackles back on. Several-too-many completely unexpected and alarmingly large credit card bills have proven to me that automatic bill payment is too erratic to trust. I'm sure that some day it'll be possible not to have to worry about debts on a near-daily basis. But I'm now convinced that it'll only happen after Star Trek-style collectivism finally kicks in and does away with currency altogether.
