Honestly, I don't understand what they're `so upset about <http://feeds.gawker.com/~r/wonkette/full/~3/133161166/the-city-paperlns-fallout-277968.php>`__. I enjoyed `the article <http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/display.php?id=2008>`__, but the revelations it contains are merely a fraction as offensive as the stuff from LNS that Wonkette has published. And I'm having a hard time seeing who's going to get fired on the basis of the piece, as the commenters are claiming. "Not friends with a bunch of jerks" isn't usually included as a requirement in job listings.
