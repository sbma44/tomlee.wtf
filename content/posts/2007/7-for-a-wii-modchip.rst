`Man that's cheap <http://www.linker4u.com/pp/item_detail.asp?itemID=%7B54C60E9F-9FD9-48F9-A291-7039CA8B700E%7D>`__. I suppose you do need to buy a `special screwdriver <http://www.linker4u.com/pp/item_detail.asp?itemID=%7BA759CE86-6957-4203-ADD4-9C8847B03DA2%7D>`__, too. Still!

**UPDATE:** Having read a bit more on the subject, it seems very likely that this is a clone of the WiiKey rather than the original chip. That wouldn't normally be a problem unless you were really counting on getting a holographic sticker with your order. But the clones don't come with firmware preinstalled — you have to download it from the `WiiKey website <http://www.wiikey.cn>`__, burn it to a disc and run it in your modded Wii, thereby loading the code on the chip. Unfortunately, Nintendo released a firmware update to the Wii a few weeks ago that made the disc format in which the firmware is encoded nonfunctional. This appears to be a temporary problem — folks have already figured out how to remaster Wii discs so that they can boot. But the WiiKey people haven't yet repackaged their firmware in a format that will work on updated Wiis.

So if you have an official WiiKey chip you already have firmware loaded and are fine. If you buy a clone you'll end up waiting for WiiKey to release a bootable upgrade disc. It's not a big deal, really, but I wouldn't want you to end up marooned. The genuine chip costs about $20 and can be acquired from the vendors listed on the WiiKey website.
