I sang the praises of The Wombats a `while ago <http://www.manifestdensity.net/2007/03/01/an_embarrassment_of_riches/>`__, although at the time the hype kaleidoscope had me confused about whether they were up & coming or come & gone. I thought they were the latter; it turns out that they're the former. And, judging by how frequently they seem to be popping up in my RSS reader, it seems like their debut full-length might be pretty big.

So here, have a couple of songs from them. The first is their most recent, I believe, and has a title that seems likely to intrigue at least a few of you.

   `The Wombats – Let's Dance To Joy Division <http://metamonkey.net/mp3/The+Wombats+-+Let%27s+Dance+To+Joy+Division.mp3>`__

And then there's this, which I think is a better song, but isn't quite as new:

   `The Wombats – Backfire At The Disco <http://metamonkey.net/mp3/The+Wombats+-+Backfire+At+The+Disco.mp3>`__

Other hypem-worthy tracks: "Patricia the Stripper", "Moving to New York", "Sunday TV".

| **UPDATE:** Hmm. This version of "Backfire At The Disco" is the one that I find a bit grating (it's from the CD single instead of *Girls, Boys & Marsupials*. I'll try to find the good one.
