A somewhat dense but `really good article <http://spectrum.ieee.org/aug07/5429>`__ from IEEE Spectrum (found via Slashdot). It comes complete with a somewhat-irritating but still very informative `Flash demonstration <http://spectrum.ieee.org/aug07/5480>`__ of the topic it discusses: how recorded music has become louder and more fatiguing as a result of an arms race between music producers that trades upon our pathetically easily-fooled nervous systems. It's like the omnipresence of corn syrup in processed foods: everyone says they don't like it, but it's hard to argue with figures showing that sweetness = sales.

The article covers a lot of ground, touching on numerous issues related to how audio storage technology works (I had no idea that engineers could alter vinyl's dynamic range during mastering — sort of like adjusting the bitrate on an MP3). Definitely worth a read. And if you have any irritating audiophile friends, you may want to send them the link. If they don't understand the piece, politely tell them to shut up for a bit about how awful digital audio technology is.
