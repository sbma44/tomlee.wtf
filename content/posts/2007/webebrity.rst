Thanks to the Nabob for `alerting <http://pygmalioninablanket.blogspot.com/2007/05/im-tired-of-lohan-anyway.html>`__ me to this week's high levels of `Express <http://www.readexpress.com>`__ inclusion. It's very flattering, and I couldn't be more pleased about the world knowing I begrudge service employees their livings as I peer down upon them from my white-collar internet playground.

The only problem is that the Express misspelled the site's URL both times. If this delays this blog's acquisition by Yahoo or Google, I'm gonna be pissed.
