Look, I know that everybody's `very concerned <http://news.independent.co.uk/environment/wildlife/article2449968.ece>`__ about the disappearing honeybees. For the record, I am pro-bee: I enjoy consuming their sugary vomit both on toast and in tea. And out of all the invertebrates I think they run the `best alternate reality games <http://www.ilovebees.com/>`__.

But the last couple of weeks have seen a ridiculously large portion of the internet devoted to concern about them. It's difficult to find a comment thread that doesn't have someone chiming in about the fucking bees. "This is somewhat OT," they'll say, "But have you heard about how cell phones are killing bees? I'm just as concerned about [Bush administration malfeasance / a blogger code of conduct / Sanjaya getting voted off Idol] as anyone else, but if we lose the bees we'll have bigger things to worry about."

This is frequently accompanied by a quote from Albert Einstein that, in an oddly contemporary, half-colloquial formulation, opines about the agricultural importance of honeybees, despite Einstein seemingly possessing no particular expertise about either subject (at least when the bees in question are traveling at less than the speed of light). I'm skeptical of this quotation's provenance, but I do kind of like the idea of attributing random boosterism to history's great thinkers. For instance, did you know that Rene Descartes is frequently credited with coining the phrase "Reduce, Reuse and Recycle"? Or that John Donne was fond of composing epigrams pointing readers to the `climatecrisis.net carbon calculator <http://www.climatecrisis.net/takeaction/carboncalculator/>`__? It's true! I'm pretty sure I read it on Wikipedia the other day.

Well, relax. According to a marginally-more-reputable source, the bees are probably going to be fine. As we drove to Stanford, Emily and I heard a full hour-long show on NPR about the disappearing insects. I can't find a URL for the show — this was the Bay area, so I guess it's probably only available on the goddamn WELL — but trust me: it was authoritative-sounding.

The roundtable discussion featured an entomologist whose lab was conducting the largest nationwide survey of colony collapse disorder, another entomologist who he seemed to not like very much, and a guy who'd written a book about California bees and, I think, lived among them and learned their ways. A parade of well-meaning San Franciscan hybrid owners called in with every possible bee-killing grievance that you, I and the rest of the internet could think of — electromagnetic radiation, GM crops, pesticides, the war in Iraq — and the bee experts methodically shot down each one. "Yes, it's disconcerting," they'd say, "But it's happened in the past, long before this particular [chemical / technology / front in the global war on terror] existed." They also said that there's no apparent correlation between affected colonies' proximity to developed areas, and that even bees that operate solely on organic crops have been afflicted. When the bees leave their colonies they abandon the site in a hurry — other animals avoid it for a while, too, even if there's still honey present. The experts seemed to feel that a fungus, parasite or other natural pest was probably to blame. It's happened before and the bees have recovered.

So let's all calm down. The most pressing bee-related problem of this spring has been and continues to be how to get rid of the threatening, probably-Africanized ones that seem to be setting up shop at the far end of my porch. Yet on this subject, the Kos diarists have remained strangely silent. Priorities, people.

**UPDATE:** Prompted by arguing the point in comments over at `Unfogged <http://www.unfogged.com/archives/week_2007_04_22.html#006670>`__, I managed to track down the program in question. It's from the imaginatively-named "Forum" on KQED. The show's archive page is `here <http://www.kqed.org/epArchive/R703090900>`__. You can download the mp3 at the following link:
