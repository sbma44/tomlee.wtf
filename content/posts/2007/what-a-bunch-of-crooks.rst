   **CLERK:** `Mo/rris House Bed & Breakfast <http://tinyurl.com/3x57kj>`__, how can I help you?

   **ME:** Yeah, hi. My parents got me a gift certificate to your hotel for my birthday and I'd like to make a reservation to use it.

   **CLERK:** Certainly sir, I can help you with that.

   **ME:** The only thing is, the certificate says it expires on August 31st, and I'd actually like to make the reservation for September 1st, the day after. Will that be a problem?

   **CLERK:** Uhh... I'll have to check. Can I call you back?

Later...

   **CLERK:** Hi, this is Mo/rris House. I talked to my supervisor and she said it'll be fine for you to use the certificate on September 1st.

   **ME:** Great!

   **CLERK:** Let me just check and... oh. Hmm. There's a problem. We only have one qualifying room left on that date.

   **ME:** Great, that'll be fine.

   **CLERK:** No, see, I can't give you that room. It's our last one.

   **ME:** I don't understand. The certificate has been paid for... It's not like you're giving me the room for free.

   **CLERK:** I'm trying to work with you sir, but if you look at the gift certificate it does say "subject to availability".

   **ME:** Right, and you just told me that a room is available.

   **CLERK:** Listen, I'm trying to work with you, sir. We're trying to be flexible about the date.

   *We go through this several more times. The hotel's policy does not begin to make more sense.*

   **ME (exasperated):** Okay. I understand the hotel already has the money for this gift certificate and doesn't want to honor it if it can possibly earn more money from someone else instead. Can I pay an up-charge or something and get the room?

   **CLERK:** Uh... I'll have to check. Can I put you on hold?

Without hanging up, the clerk calls me on a different line.

   **CLERK:** I got good news for you, sir! I can give you the room if you pay an extra $20.

So fine, I paid the $20. But really now: c'mon. My parents' thoughtful gift has already been paid for with perfectly good money. It's time for you to honor your end of the bargain. Stop being such jerks.

I'm Googleproofing this for the time being so that the Mo/rris House people don't do horrible things to our breakfast or play more reservation shenanigans. But this is pretty sleazy behavior. It's just one goddamn day. Is it really worth jerking your clients around for an extra $20?
