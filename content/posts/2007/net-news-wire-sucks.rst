I thought I'd love this software; everyone else does. And the UI *is* pretty good. But it keeps forgetting my entry-sorting preferences; it gets confused if I have identically-named feeds with different URLs; and it seems to be updating erratically, suddenly finding old posts that I know have been online for a few days. There's no way that this many different RSS feeds that I'm subscribed to have simultaneously become screwed up in the last couple of days — it's got to be the reader.

But that's just an irritating recent issue. Far worse is a long-term but difficult-to-spot bug I've been having wherein NNW occasionally loses a feed entirely, transmuting it into a clone of another one. After an initial honeymoon I'm being forced to conclude that this program can't even perform its core function. It kinda blows, and I'm surprised to have so many problems with a well-established program. I guess paying for software was a bad idea after all.
