I really don't think I did, but I *was* out drinking that night, so I suppose I should just go ahead and ask. Michael, Matt, Ezra, Sam, Sarah and everyone else who was out on Friday: did we get drunk at Townhouse and then go grocery shopping in Michigan? Normally I wouldn't ask, but Bank of America sent me an email on Saturday morning wondering about these charges:

I've gone ahead and ordered a new card, but man oh man will I ever feel sheepish if I find a cancelled and beer-stained Kroger receipt lying around the apartment a week from now.

More seriously, this has been surprisingly easy to deal with — I had the whole thing wrapped up and a temporary ATM card in hand within about an hour of getting the initial alert email. It's a real credit to Bank of America, I think, and even more noteworthy when you consider how essentially evil an organization they are.

The obvious question to ask is how the crook got my number at all. I haven't been patronizing internet retailers particularly much in the last week or two, but I did make a few suspect purchases:

- A while ago I ordered something from `SparkFun Electronics <http://www.sparkfun.com>`__. But those guys are great, and I've ordered from them once before. I don't think it could be them.
- I bought a new cellphone battery from a somewhat shady Ebay retailed not too long ago. But I made the payment through PayPal (or Yahoo stores; I forget which), so I kind of doubt it was them.
- The final and most troubling possibility is the Wii: I bought Super Mario 64 about an hour before leaving the house on Friday night, and did so by using the Wii's integrated store. But surely Nintendo processes payments securely, right? Right?

My childlike faith in the internet makes it hard for me to believe that it's any of these candidates. I haven't gone through my back statements to check for earlier fraud, so it could have happened before these three candidates — I just don't know. There's also a non-electronic possibility: it could've been stolen when I opened a tab at DC9 on Thursday night, too. I did end up with a suspiciously low bar tab.

Anyway, it's all very mysterious, but for now the danger seems to have passed.
