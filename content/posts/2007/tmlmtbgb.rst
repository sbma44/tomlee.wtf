Kriston and Kate dragged Emily and I, kicking and screaming, out to get some culture last night, having purchased tickets to *Too Much Light Makes The Baby Go Blind* on our behalf. "It's okay," Emily assured me, "We can always leave and go see *Die Hard* — it's only a couple of blocks away."

But the play was great; if there are any performances with unsold tickets left, you should go. I thought the entirely serious pieces didn't work all that well, partly because there were so few of them and partly because they were a bit banal (yes, the Iraq War is bad; yes, Jesus probably wouldn't persecute gay people). But the rest of the plays were consistently hilarious, and never even a little boring.
