Not to be a scold, but after yesterday I think I should emphasize: you might want to try to avoid getting migraines. I knew something strange was happening when the screen started swimming and I couldn't properly string together words for an IM conversation with `Cyrus <http://cyrusfarivar.com/blog/>`__. This was mostly just confusing and interesting — I've been fascinated by aphasias, agnosias and other functional deficits ever since since I learned the `blind spot trick <http://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/chvision.html>`__. But from there things quickly descended into a dull ache exacerbated by attempts to read. I finally gave up and went home, where a nap more or less set things right. But the back left side of my brain still felt worn out for the rest of the night, like the strip of grass in the middle of a soccer field.

Fortunately, this was unusual — I can only feel sorry for the folks afflicted with migraines on a chronic basis. In my case I can only conclude it was caused by — what else? — suspicious, out-of-the-ordinary coffee. I know, I know; even I'm having a hard time believing that explanation at this point. But I'm really at a loss for what else it could be.
