**Troy**: *Enough* with the elegiac moaning. Christ.

Of greater potential interest: **Futurama (Bender's Big Score)** — disappointing! I've read the continuity-obsessed script described as an attempt to reward loyal fans, but it comes off more as an attempt by the (presumably) new writers to prove that they've watched the original series carefully. It's great that they enjoyed those episodes. I did, too! But the invocation of their jokes often amounts to repetition. The whole experience reminded me of finding myself at a party, stuck listening to someone recite genuinely funny material that I could already recollect perfectly well without the benefit of a new, much worse performance.

On a more positive note, I should mention that there's a sass-talking robot.
