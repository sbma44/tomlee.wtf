- **PRO:** Towels are self-drying.
- **CON:** Dust accumulates on surfaces regardless of the moral culpability of the surface's owner. This is typically the first thing that comes to mind when I hear the phrase "cosmic injustice".
- **PRO:** The tendency of energy to seek less-ordered states allows physical work to exist in the universe, which can can be harnessed by order-increasing processes, including those that form the basis of life.
- **CON:** Videogame controller cords frequently become tangled.
- **PRO/CON:** Bags of candy (e.g. Skittles) are self-mixing. However, this is somewhat offset by the resulting necessity of M&M sorting, which significantly drives up the per-unit cost of rock & roll.
- **PRO:** Ice makes drinks colder.
- **CON:** The inevitable heat death of the universe. This sounds like it will be a drag.

**VERDICT:** Mixed. Entropy allows life to exist, but also means that life will consist largely of tidying up. It's unclear whether this is a net positive or negative.
