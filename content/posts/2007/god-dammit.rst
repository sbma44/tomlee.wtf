|I'm not getting a tax refund|

Yeah, yeah, I know: it's better to have to pay a small amount/refunds are tax-free loans to uncle sam/there's always next yea*&@#I WANT FREE MONEY!!! And if I'm not getting any, why am I doing my taxes now, instead of at 11:45 pm on April 14?

This is the first year I haven't gotten a refund. New job, yes, but default withholding, I thought. I guess the addition of a 401(k) really fucked me over. It was not, presumably, the whopping $28 in dividends that the lingering shreds of my college mutual fund delivered.

I guess this means my dreams of HDTV ownership will once again be delayed. At least I've got that thirty dollar refund from D.C. That should cover, oh, about half of the cost of doing my taxes on H&R Block's website — something else that I've never had to pay for before.

Man. Doing my taxes used to be a lot more fun.
