I've got a quick post up at EchoDitto Labs detailing `how to use the new Yahoo Pipes Web Services module with PHP <http://labs.echoditto.com/pipes-and-php>`__. Not exactly rocket science, but might come in handy for anyone who doesn't want to ponder the Java example that Yahoo provides.

Many thanks to `son1 <http://bayes.wordpress.com/2007/08/16/json-and-the-piping-bots/>`__ for tipping me off to the existence of this module — it makes an already-powerful service even more versatile.
