I got an EVDO card for a long weekend from Verizon, then returned it. "You'll be prorated," I was assured. I wasn't, and instead got charged a full month's fees for 4 days' worth of use.

I thought I'd paid it anyway, but maybe not. Either way, I eventually got a message from "Miracle Financial". I returned their call and left a message asking for them to call me back and let me know what they were calling about. I had also gotten a call from another financial company on the same night, but that one was looking for someone else. I figured that some predatory lending agency had gotten my number on an industry-wide spam list, so after doing my part for our new game of phone tag I didn't think much else about it.

The next call I got was today, and came from an abusive gentleman who refused to let me leave the conversation in order to call Verizon. Instead he started yelling about my credit report (as if a $70 outstanding balance was going to put that dreamhouse of mine out of reach). "We'll be calling you for seven years!" he bellowed, which didn't make an awful lot of sense — I think the number comes from the years until an offense goes off your credit report, but who knows. I assume he does this all the time, so it must work despite the complete lack of sense.

I'm disinclined to feed money directly to people who call me up to yell at me, so I hung up on him and called Verizon. A maze of prompts later I get a human being, who told me that I couldn't talk to them about the issue — I'd have to talk to the collection guys. Of course, the collection guy had already told me that I can't talk to them about the incorrect charge, either. I just need to pay up, preferably by directly giving my credit card number to some lout who had called me out of the blue.

So I cut them a check. What else could I do? If a company decides you owe them money, they can simply refuse to listen to you or correct their mistake. Instead they'll pay some professional dickhead in Massachusetts to harass you by telephone until you give up. If that fails they'll tell every other corporation how terrible you are. Unless you're a lawyer with a lot of free time, there's not much you can do about it.

I remember many still, sunny Sunday mornings at UVA when the perfect awfulness of my hangover was wrenched into consciousness by an angry collections call. Not for me, of course — I'm actually surprisingly good at paying my bills, despite only opening my mail once a month or so. Instead it was for the people who had the phone number before me. They would tell me not to deny that I was [name other than my own], and strongly encourage me to settle my outstanding debt immediately. And they'd do with the same prerecorded call every time. I eventually had to track down the company responsible, call during business hours and politely ask them to shut the fuck up. To their credit, they did. Still, you have to wonder about what would drive someone into a career of professional unpleasantness.

Anyway, it's a lousy thing to have happen in the middle of your day, and all the more infuriating because these jerks don't even have a web presence for me to sheepishly submit my payment to — instead I had to speak to an actual person. I still refused to do anything other than mail them a check, but that didn't make me feel much better. Will polluting their nonexistent Google ranking help? Nah, probably not. But dammit, I have to try.
