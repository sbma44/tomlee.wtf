- `Some notes on developing Google Mapplets <http://labs.echoditto.com/google-mapplets>`__. Mostly just a rehash of the `documentation <http://www.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/mapplets/>`__, but some might find it useful.
- The Unfoggedbot is doing pretty well, but just choked on the RSS feed again. I think that may have been because Becks was adding a feature I'd requested. Maybe not, though. I need to add some better error handling to that script, which is unexpectedly shaping up to be the weak spot in the system. I'll also need to schedule some downtime during which I add code to clear out the database every week or so — as things stand right now the comment DB will just keep growing and growing.
