|title graphic from the fifth episode of Defenders of Stan|\ The episode of *Defenders of Stan* in which I, `Emily <http://www.movering.com>`__, Hemal and two mysterious strangers `got to be extras <http://www.manifestdensity.net/2007/02/19/superheroics/>`__ is `now online <http://www.channel102.net/view.php?epid=206>`__.

I had planned another round of `deluxe video labeling <http://www.manifestdensity.net/2007/02/02/sommer/>`__, but given the way they cut it I don't think it's really worth the effort.

If you haven't seen any episodes of DoS before, I'd suggest `episode 4 <http://www.channel102.net/view.php?epid=205>`__ as its current pinnacle so far (although you may need the exposition of episode 1 to figure out what the hell is going on). That's not to take anything away from the recent episode and its formidable star power, but the fact that I heard bits and pieces of a lot of the jokes during filming makes it seem a bit less funny to me than the others.
