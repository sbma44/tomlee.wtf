I don't know if anyone else has stumbled across the `Man Vs. Wild <http://dsc.discovery.com/fansites/manvswild/manvswild.html?dcitc=w99-502-ah-1002>`__ marathon that Discovery played tonight, but if you haven't seen the show I recommend you track it down and give it a few Tivo thumbs-up. It's a survival show hosted by an ex-special forces `badass <http://dsc.discovery.com/fansites/manvswild/manvswild.html?dcitc=w99-502-ah-1002>`__ (but he's British, so he's charming). Tonight I got to watch him rip the meat from a zebra carcass with his teeth and squeeze life-sustaining water from elephant droppings directly into his mouth. Seriously! And that was just one episode!

Anyway, if you've got an inner boy scout you should really check this out. It makes that `Survivor Man <http://science.discovery.com/convergence/survivorman/survivorman.html>`__ dude — who is admittedly awesome in his own right — come off like that weirdo who keeps spending his family's savings on anti-bear suits that the military then refuses to buy.
