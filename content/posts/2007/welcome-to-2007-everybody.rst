|party people|

And thanks to those of you that stopped by last night. I'm going to go ahead and call the whole thing a big success. We suspect that our bathroom may have been host to both drug use and, uh, romance. If that's not the mark of a good party, I don't know what is.

I've spent today hungover & whining, but things are looking up — it may almost be time to venture out and get some food. While I steel myself for that, here are the non-terrible photos that I found on my camera this morning. I'm particularly fond of `this shot <http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/341374327/in/set-72157594452559819/>`__ of Michael and Emily, and `this one <http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/341381104/in/set-72157594452559819/>`__ of Spencer, who receives Party MVP status for his superlative karaoke performance (narrowly edging out Kriston, who ably assumed the mantle of DJ-dom when called to duty).

**OH YEAH:** There was also some `knife fighting <http://flickr.com/photos/mcdermott/340959816/in/set-72157594451931245/>`__. Like I said, it was a good party.
