Remember that ridiculously sunny, poppy band I `linked to </2007/03/22/its-sunny-and-beautiful-outside/>`__ a while ago? The Lovekevins? Sure you do. Well, they're going to be playing at Natalya and Melissa's `Scandi-pop DJ night <http://www.myspace.com/hejhejdc>`__ at DC9 on `July 10 <http://www.flickr.com/photos/22137978@N00/532276021/>`__. Sounds like fun.

More immediately: Charles is playing at Chief Ike's on Thursday. I guess that Aaron, Spencer and Bayes will be there too. You should still come, though.

And finally, EVEN MORE immediately, I think Emily and I will be heading down to the `Old Dominion Brewhouse <http://www.olddominionbrewhouse.com/>`__ tonight to consume towers of beer\*, watch the NHL finals in glorious HD and, in my case, write the morning roundup. I called the place and have been told that they may have internet but not wifi, and it only works sometimes. It was a confusing exchange, but I remain optimistic. If you've got an inclination to eat some fried snacks and drink Molson, drop on by.

\* for those unfamiliar with D.C.'s premiere brewery-themed conventioneer destination, this is the literal distribution mechanism the place uses
