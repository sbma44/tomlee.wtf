So, I suppose I should have mentioned this earlier, but I'm on the verge of a delirious Western adventure. First! A week of vacation in California. Emily and I are headed to the bay area to hang out with `Jeff <http://www.jeffnye.org>`__, Marie, Chris, Paul, Jon, my aunt & uncle, and the hippies, weirdos, fortune-seekers and drug addicts that power the world's seventh-largest economy.

Second! It's back home via Austin, where we'll rejoin the EchoDitto crew at SXSW Interactive for some good old-fashioned internet fun. Needless to say if any readers, lurkers or inter-friends will be in either area you should send me an email. If you don't have my address, send a blank message to tom@[this domain] to get the real one sent to you (consider it an experiment in spammer-foiling).
