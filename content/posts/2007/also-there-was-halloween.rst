Right, Halloween: it's already happened, as far as I'm concerned. I'm exhausted, haven't been to the gym in ages, and have a ton of work to finish. I intend to nod approvingly as Charles hands out the massive quantities of candy that he bought, but my holiday celebrations occurred last Saturday. I think I'm even skipping out on a fun-sounding bar outing.

But last weekend was pretty great. Here's a shot of me as Dr. Doom, looking disoriented:

And `here's <http://flickr.com/photos/48199512@N00/1793946986/in/set-72157602766722812/>`__ a shot of me fighting Galactus.

A few things learned during the costume construction process:

#. I think Dr. Doom probably makes his own outfits. If you find yourself in possession of a lot of green fabric, an enthusiasm for diabolical technology and little to no sewing skill, a Doomesque cape and tunic combo is a not-unlikely result.

#. Dr. Doom's `enthusiasm for goblets <http://www.thesmoothdj.com/DrDoom_Head.jpg>`__ is born of necessity: it's really hard to hold onto a beverage while wearing gauntlets. Cupping your drink from beneath is really the only viable strategy. The fact that it looks good when paired with a menacing glower is just a happy coincidence.

#. `Negative ion generators </2007/10/11/part-of-my-halloween-costume/>`__ are a `nice <http://www.afrotechmods.com/cheap/negativeiongenerator/pikashoe7.htm>`__ `idea <http://phrets.com/electrifried/>`__, but they're also likely to stop working pretty quickly. And you need to think seriously about electrical isolation if you want to build up any kind of charge — ancient sneakers spraypainted silver (and paired with a cape that occasionally drags) are not the best way to keep voltage from leaking into the ground. I managed to give a few people pinprick shocks before the whole thing stopped working, but it mostly served to gently electrocute my right foot. Overall, it was a bit of a disappointment (although thankfully not a very expensive one).

   But I got some late advice from Dan Rutter of DansData.com, which may be useful for aspiring Dooms:

      | You might like to try buying one of those "shocking" lighters or pens
      | that're all over eBay and joke shops these days; they're basically
      | just a little Tesla coil inside, I think, and it ought to be quite
      | easy to hack one into a shock-glove.

      | (A friend of mine made a rather higher powered version of the same
      | thing years ago, and installed it in a small project box with
      | external contacts, a button, and a label that said "DO NOT PRESS".
      | Needless to say, people picked it up, and pressed the button, and
      | sometimes then smashed themselves in the face with the box. :-)

   Sounds promising. Next year: `Electro <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electro_%28comics%29>`__?

At any rate, here are the rest of my photos from the evening. As you might notice, there are kind of a lot of shots of a jack o'lantern sitting in front of a smoke machine's output hose. That's because this is *totally awesome* and should enthrall the lot of you the way it does me. Some people will tell you that on Saturday night I could often be found stumbling around the shrubs, fiddling with the smoke machine. More responsible accounts of the evening will reflect the fact that A) it takes a lot of work to maintain an optimally foggy environment for the enjoyment of all and B) it's pretty hard to navigate a garden while wearing a cape and cardboard armor regardless of how many beers you've just consumed.
