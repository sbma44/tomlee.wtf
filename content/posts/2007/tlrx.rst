I almost forgot: be sure to check out the `new Ted Leo track over at YANP <http://www.youaintnopicasso.com/2007/01/16/ted-leorx-the-sons-of-cain/>`__. *Shake The Sheets* was a little disappointing to me, but this track takes me right back to `2004 <http://www.zunta.org/blog/archives/2004/07/02/day_by_day/>`__. It reminds me of watching Ted carom around the stage at Fort Reno, contained only by the venue's curfew, the peacefulness of the summer night and whatever little constraint his curly guitar cord afforded.
