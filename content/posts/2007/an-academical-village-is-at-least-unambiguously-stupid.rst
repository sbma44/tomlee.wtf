`Teo <http://sunlitwater.wordpress.com/2007/05/14/i-can-sometimes-answer-questions/>`__ has put up an interesting post discussing the use of a/an and how it evolved along with pronunciation (complete with bonus UVA tie-in!). Misuse of a/an is a pet peeve of mine — when I come across "an university" or a similar formulation I immediately know that what I'm reading is going to become terrible, if it isn't already. It's a great tip-off that the author hasn't made a connection between writing and speaking, and that spells trouble — a stream of "whilst"s is rarely far behind.

On the other end of the spectrum, of course, is `Yglesias <http://www.matthewyglesias.com>`__'s neverending cavalcade of homophones — a case where speaking and writing are so tightly connected that all kinds of amusing minor typos result (see also: my constant overuse of colons, semicolons, emdashes and commas). I suppose you can err too far in either direction, but Matt's is by far the more readable option.

Of course, none of this explains the dismayingly frequent "an historic" formulation. I can't account for that one at all, except to say that I think our species is probably doomed.
