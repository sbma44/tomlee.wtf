A question: why doesn't anyone put wind turbines on top of skyscrapers? Mythbusters just informed me that gusts at that height can reach 90 mph. Selling the produced electricity back to the grid might be problematic in a lot of places, but one imagines the energy could be used for the building's heating and cooling plant. And it'd surely be a great marketing investment for a company looking to burnish its eco-credentials.

On the other hand, I imagine that "GIANT SPINNING BLADES" may be the sort of architectural feature about which zoning laws have something to say.
