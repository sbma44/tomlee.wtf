Matt `notes <http://matthewyglesias.theatlantic.com/archives/2007/08/bad_idea_of_the_day.php>`__ that applying copyright to fashion is a bad idea, and of course he's right. But look! That's not even the most reprehensible intellectual property news of the day: `via Slashdot <http://yro.slashdot.org/yro/07/08/09/125203.shtml>`__ I see that `Johnson & Johnson is suing the Red Cross <http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/08/09/america/NA-GEN-US-Red-Cross-Lawsuit.php>`__ for using... the red cross symbol. But it sounds like the Red Cross has *also* been misbehaving, licensing the symbol to businesses in a way that's disallowed by an old agreement between the RC and J&J.

I realize that trademarks don't expire in the same way that patents and copyrights do, but surely there's a `genericide <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark#Maintaining_trademark_rights_.E2.80.94_abandonment_and_genericide>`__ argument to be made here — I had no idea the red cross belonged to Johnson & Johnson. I thought their mark was the intertwined Js that appear on their products, and that the cross was just generic decoration.

Who knows what the courts will decide. But it seems obvious to me that the symbol belongs in the public domain. Johnson & Johnson shouldn't be dragging charities into court over it, and charities shouldn't be selling licenses that they aren't entitled to grant.
