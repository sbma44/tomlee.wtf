Everyone gets a ton of Nigerian 419 scams in their inbox, but I've got a new favorite. Apparently I've got a nefarious uncle who's trying to claim my new fortune for himself by maintaining that I recently died in a car accident. The dastard! Fortunately, my friends at the IMF are uneasy with his story — and, of course, deeply concerned that the sum in question gets to the person who truly deserves it. So they're trying to get in touch with me:

   We want to hear from you before we can make the transfer to confirm if you are dead or not.

      RE: OUTSTANDING PAYMENT.
      Good day, Your Long overdue Payment. I saw your name (in the Central Computer among the list of unpaid contractors,inheritance next of kin and lotto beneficiaries that was originated from Africa, Europe,
      Asia Plus Middle east, Americans ) among the list of individuals and companies that your unpaid fund has been located to the Standard Chartered Bank, HSBC,Barclays Bank, Natwest  Bank Uk,and Bank o f America.
      Your name appeared among the beneficiaries who will receive a part-payment of $10 million and has been approved already for months. You are requested to get back to me for more direction and instruction on how to receive your fund. However, we received an email from one Mr. Robert Water who told us that he is your next of kin and that you died in a car accident last
      week.
