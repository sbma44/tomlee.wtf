I was sitting in a not-that-eventful software development event this afternoon when I got a phone call from an unknown number. I expected this — my mom was scheduled to have some surgery tomorrow and the hospital's patient-wrangler was due to call and tell me where we needed to be and when.

But no! It was MPD on the line, wanting to confirm my identity and address and then informing me that Charles' and my apartment had been broken into. I think I said something off-color like "oh jeez!" and set off on my bike.

Apparently some jerk had pulled up in a plausible-looking van from a HVAC company. I guess he had tried to pry open the front door, since some of the trim had been removed and the police found a prybar in a backpack in the garbage can. But that didn't work. So he set up some not-that-official-looking cones and a ladder and used them to climb through a window.

The same thing happened to our neighbor Paul about a year ago. Fortunately, our neighbor Katie was home and kept an eye on the guy. She eventually decided that he looked shady enough to merit a call to the cops, who nabbed the guy as he was coming out. In his possession at the time: an iBook charger, a jar full of change and our beloved Nintendo Wii (no Wiimotes, though).

The cops took statements, dusted for prints, had me do a walkthrough and even gave us back our things. Throughout it all the officers and detective were friendly, professional, thorough and, in one case, kind of foxy.

Better yet, my mom's operation has been rescheduled. So I'm currently sitting on my couch in the sun, home from work, sipping coffee and getting ready to take care of some coding that I thought I was going to have to sprint to finish. Getting robbed is great!

**ALSO:** `Amanda <http://blogstretch.blogspot.com>`__ tells me that she asked Travis Morrison my let's-say-one-eighth-joking question about his preferred Javascript library during her interview with him. Awesome. This has turned into a pretty good day.
