Lots of people I know are doing great things on the internet, and I haven't been paying enough attention. So here! Some links that you ought to pay attention to, two of which are shamelessly lifted from `DCeiver <http://dceiver.blogspot.com/2007/08/dceptette-tickety-tockety.html>`__.

- `Yogaball is sweeping the nation <http://www.movering.com/yogaball>`__, and all that you can hope to do is familiarize yourself with its rules before a rising tide of family fun sweeps over the carpeted floors of your home and you just stare — and then it's like the time between now and that first spreading sheet of water never existed, and suddenly you're crying/gasping for breath in a small pocket of air near the ceiling, an indifferent flashlight bobbing next to you, and you can hear yourself and the splashing water but otherwise it's silent. THAT'S how fun Yogaball is. Prepare yourself, and consider purchasing flood and/or lawn sport insurance (if available/extant).
- Have you ever wondered what Sommer's favorite food is? Of course you have. Well, stop torturing yourself about it. This and other revelations can be found in `her interview with Washingtonian <http://www.washingtonian.com/blogarticles/people/capitalcomment/4989.html>`__, which she handled with grace and wit.
- `This <http://pygmalioninablanket.blogspot.com/2007/08/something-meaty-this-way-comes-part-2.html>`__ is what Western civilization has been working toward all these years. When I look at that meat cake I suddenly understand how Christopher Hitchens has been feeling these past six years.
