A few traumatic hours ago Ogged alerted me to some `alarming allegations <http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article2116195.ece>`__ about my beloved *Man Vs. Wild* (known as *Born Survivor* in the UK):

   | To live up to his public image of a rugged, ex-SAS adventurer, it must have seemed essential for Bear Grylls to appear at ease sleeping rough and catching his own food in his television survival series.
   | But it has emerged that Grylls, 33, was enjoying a far more conventional form of comfort, retreating some nights from filming in mountains and on desert islands to nearby lodges and hotels.
   | Now Channel 4 has launched an investigation into whether Grylls, who has conquered Everest and the Arctic, deceived the public in his series Born Survivor.
   | ...
   | [A]n adviser to *Born Survivor* has disclosed that at one location where the adventurer claimed to be a â€œreal life Robin-son Crusoeâ€? trapped on â€œa desert islandâ€?, he was actually on an outlying part of the Hawaiian archipelago and spent nights at a motel.
   | On another occasion in Californiaâ€™s Sierra Nevada mountains where he was filmed biting off the head of a snake for breakfast and struggling for survival â€œwith just a water bottle, a cup and a flint for making fireâ€?, he actually slept some nights with the crew in a lodge fitted with television and internet access. The Pines Resort at Bass Lake is advertised as â€œa cosy getaway for familiesâ€? with blueberry pancakes for breakfast.
   | In one episode Grylls, son of the late Tory MP Sir Michael Grylls, was shown apparently building a Polynesian-style raft using only materials around him, including bamboo, hibiscus twine and palm leaves for a sail.
   | But according to Mark Weinert, an Oregon-based survival consultant brought in for the job, it was he who led the team that built the raft. It was then dismantled so that Grylls could be shown building it on camera.
   | In another episode viewers watched as Grylls tried to coax an apparently wild mustang into a lasso in the Sierra Nevada. â€œIâ€™m in luck,â€? he told viewers, apparently coming across four wild horses grazing in a meadow. â€œA chance to use an old native American mode of transport comes my way. This is one of the few places in the whole of the US where horses still roam wild.â€?
   | In fact, Weinert said, the horses were not wild but were brought in by trailer from a nearby trekking station for the â€œchoreographedâ€? feature.

Josh has been disqualifieded amidst a cloud of scandal, Dumbledore's dead and now Man Versus Wild is a fraud — where the hell are all the male role models going!?

Fortunately, a commenter on the story offers a ray of hope:

   Bear is for sure coming after the person making the allegations and there is no escaping him, not even in the remotest parts of the world. He will hunt you down.

We're going to fight this thing!
