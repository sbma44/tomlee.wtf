I've been having a lucky streak when it comes to new music:

Spoon – Ga Ga Ga Ga Ga
   It turns out that Joe Strummer faked his death. Thank goodness.
Stars – In Our Bedroom After The War
   Every Stars song sort of sounds like it's being sung while staring passionately into someone's eyes as a mustachioed villain flourishes his cape in the wings and plots to destroy the Moulin Rouge. This may or may not be a problem.
`Travison Morrison – All Y'All </2007/07/27/command-line-rock/>`__
   The emerging consensus seems to be "almost as good as the Plan!" I'll take a dramatically iconoclastic approach and say that parts of it are just as good as the Plan, while others are not.
The Cribs – Men's Needs, Women's Needs, Whatever
   Where were you guys when I was driving to the beach?
The Polyphonic Spree – The Fragile Army
   They have more than one song now, and you should give it a listen.

**SPECIAL BONUS SINGLE TRACK ANALOGIZING:**

`Maritime – The Guns of Navarone <http://www.stereogum.com/archives/mp3/new-maritime-guns-of-navarone.html>`__
   Robert Pollard, polished with granulated sugar to a gleaming smoothness.

**ALSO:** `WOXY's 32kbps aacPlus stream <http://woxy.lala.com/stream/aac32.pls>`__ really does sound amazingly good in comparison to their 64kbps MP3 stream. iTunes can't play it, but `VLC <http://www.videolan.org/vlc/>`__ can.
