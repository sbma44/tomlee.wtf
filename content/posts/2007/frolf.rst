Before I forget, check it out — wholesome all-American activity, conducted on the Fourth of July in a patriotic manner:

Ah, frisbee golf — or, more properly, "disc golf", as it's called by people sufficiently obsessed with it that Whammo suing one of their clubs or tournaments is a real possibility. Charles and I used to play all the time in high school, along with Jeff, Chris, Jon and Mark Zuckerman and whoever else was handy. It was cheap, vaguely outdoorsy and pretty fun. And `Bluemont <http://maps.google.com/maps?f=l&view=text&q=601+noth+manchester+street&near=Arlington,+VA&ie=UTF8&hl=en&latlng=38873065,-77134417,6954809954099064469&ei=g4OORuaGOorerQK_op20AQ&cd=1>`__ has one of the best courses in the area, although the first three holes are a bit overgrown at the moment. Head over to `Casual Adventure <http://www.casualadventure.com/index2.shtml>`__, pick up a couple of discs and go play. It's only approximately as dorky as you think. Avoid the weird middle-aged dudes sporting frisbee bags and invitations to their mothers' basements and you'll have a pretty good time.
