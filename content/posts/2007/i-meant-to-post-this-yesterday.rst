Thoughts on the future of the recording industry from `Matt Yglesias <http://www.matthewyglesias.com/archives/2007/03/drm_fools/>`__, `Michael Arrington <http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/03/21/good-news-cd-music-sales-down-20-from-2006/>`__ and `Atrios <http://atrios.blogspot.com/2007_03_18_atrios_archive.html#117448466965070488>`__. I particularly like Arrington's take — it's nice to see people abandoning the traditional shiny-happy rhetoric about how record labels just need to adapt to changing technology, then they'll all be be rich and happy again. The truth is that technology has drastically reduced the need for musical middlemen. I'm sure the industry will always exist in some form, but a lot of the people with financial stakes in it are doomed. Now we just have to get them to wrap up their unpleasantly-loud legal death rattle.
