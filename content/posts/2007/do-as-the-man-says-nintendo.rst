This is very, very neat, and I'm desperate to see it show up in, say, a new version of Time Crisis. Be sure to watch until at least 2:45.

The man behind it, a Carnegie Mellon doctoral student named Johnny Lee, has `a number of other awesome Wiimote-related projects <http://www.cs.cmu.edu/%7Ejohnny/projects/wii/>`__ and has been getting attention from Hackaday and MAKE as a result. All his stuff is open-sourced, too — Windows-based, unfortunately, but it looks to me like the Wiimote is doing most of the heavy lifting in these applications (although Lee's demo apps are certainly plenty polished-looking).
