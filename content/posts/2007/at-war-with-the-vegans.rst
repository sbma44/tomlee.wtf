Vegetate: surprisingly popular. I headed over this evening to wish `Rob <http://www.goodspeedupdate.com>`__ a happy 25th birthday and was amazed to see to see how packed the all-veggie restaurant became before I left. I'd just sort of assumed that this was another well-meaning progressive initiative that my superficial support would be unable to save from inevitable failure. You know, like Air America. Or affirmative action.

But no! The place was chock full of earnest vegetarians, vegans and perhaps even a few `Breatharians <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breatharianism>`__. The bar only stocked a dozen or so bottles of liquor, but they were all plenty fancy. And the sadly lacking beer selection didn't stop me from becoming adequately intoxicated.

Anyway, I was caught off guard. During their lengthy battle with Shiloh I had assumed that the business was somehow paying its rent with dividends earned on a well-justified sense of indignation. But I guess there are actually lot of people out there who don't like eating meat. Well, good for them. But do me a favor and demand a few more types of beer to go with your not-meat.
