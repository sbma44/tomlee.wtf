|graphic for kriston's campaign to get the nytimes to get rid of their stupid double-click functionality|\ Kriston's `on to something here <http://grammarpolice.net/archives/001221.php>`__. People don't want websites to make their browsers work in radically different ways than they normally do. Or at least they don't want them to when everything else seems to be normal. This NYTimes behavior is almost as irritating as the `snap.com <http://www.snap.com>`__ preview windows that now pop up by default on every `wordpress.com <http://www.wordpress.com>`__ blog.

I imagine that the folks at the Times will come to their senses. But to me the most remarkable part of all of this isn't the stupidity of the "feature" — it's how many people seem to share my affliction. I thought I was the only one who constantly highlighted and rehighlighted text while reading things on the web. But no! It seems that Kriston, `Spencer <http://toohotfortnr.blogspot.com>`__ and `Ogged <http://www.unfogged.com>`__ all suffer the same compulsion. And who knows how many more suffer in silence? Man. It just feels good to talk about it.

Actually, though, I'm not sure whether I can still count myself among their ranks. I don't remember performing the highlighting tic recently. But I honestly couldn't say whether that's because I've gotten out of the habit or because it's now so automatic for me that I don't notice myself doing it.
