I've got `a post <http://www.dcist.com/2007/06/07/gmaps_street_vi.php>`__ up over at DCist sharing the news that Google may be recording their Street View data for D.C. over the weekend. Someone left the following comments on it (both with the same info):

   | well, i can give you a definite YES on your question. i'm one of the
   | people standing there in that blurry image of the car. a former NGS
   | employee is now working with immersive media, and she stopped by to give us
   | a tour of their VW bug. they're working on many, many cities (in addition
   | to the few that have been rolled out on google's website).

and

   | man, they're going to kill me, but here's another tip. they're going to do
   | most of their coverage of downtown over the weekend, when there are less
   | people on the street, so if you want to get a message in, head downtown and
   | sit around all day saturday, or try to hunt the beetle down. just don't
   | pick your nose. :)

If you want to get something permanently committed to Google's version of D.C., now's your chance.
