Let me preface this by saying that I am sorry to be writing it. There is nothing I wish for more than our people to live in mutual prosperity and comity. However, I feel that I can no longer remain silent.

It's an open secret that there are one or more undocumented mice living in this apartment. Although the arrangement is kept off the books, most of us adopt a live-and-let-live attitude with regard to it. You perform the vital burrowing and crumb-removal jobs that other apartment residents are unwilling or too large to do. In return we forbid our friend Jon from bringing his snakes over when he visits. The arrangement works well: perhaps someday your children will be able to live a better life as detectives, professional rescuers, or confidantes to exiled princesses. I'm even willing to fund the training and tiny anthropomorphic articles of clothing that they'll need to pursue these dreams.

But let's be frank: our peoples have something of an uneasy truce. You're here whether I like it or not. Everyone knows that proposals to build better walls or do the dishes in a timely manner are little more than the lunatic ravings of the Pat Buchanans and Lou Dobbs of the world. But just because we can't get rid of you doesn't mean we can't make your life `more difficult <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falconry>`__. It's in your best interest to work with us, not against us.

To be blunt, the events of the past 24 hours have been a grave breach of our unspoken covenant. You are not on the lease, and consequently you are not entitled to collect the services that are available to other apartment residents — in this case, mortuary services. We're not running some rodent hospice here, you know.

In the future, please ensure that your loved ones expire somewhere off the premises, or at the very least not in my room. Further, in the event of an accidental death on-premises I require prompt notification — preferably by email (and in an appropriately apologetic tone). Finally — and I can't stress this enough — *embalming or cremation must be conducted promptly*.

I am sure that this must be a difficult time for the family of the individual in question. Nevertheless, I must demand your prompt consideration and immediate compliance with these directives.

Oh yeah! I'm not issuing any more driver's licenses, either. I don't care what Geraldo said on O'Reilly.
