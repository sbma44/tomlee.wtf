There are some little kids playing music in front of the school at 16th and L and you know what? They aren't that bad — definitely better than some Ft. Reno acts I've seen. And with their aggressive & lousy drumming; dreamy feedback; dreary, meandering keyboards; and singing that sort of recalls Tom Morello (until you see the vocalist is, like, 8), I think they'd fit right in.
