Alright, it was a little crowded and hot, at least one channel could be counted on to be clipping until 2/3 of the way through each song, and somebody standing near me seemed to have had a big meal of chili and corn nuts immediately before coming to DC9 (my personal recommendation: `grasshopper tacos <http://www.oyamel.com/>`__ — the taste is just okay, but the horrifying-your-girlfriend potential is pretty solid).

Still, that was a fine, fine rock show. Congratulations to `Amanda <http://blogstretch.blogspot.com>`__, `Kyle <http://www.informationleafblower.com>`__ and `Sommer <http://cruelsommer.blogspot.com>`__ for another wildly successful Unbuckled.

But I think we need a new term for whatever genre of music Le Loup belongs to, or aspires to belong to. Along with Arcade Fire, the Polyphonic Spree, Broken Social Scene and who knows who else, this is a band that clearly has a ridiculous number of members, but somehow manages to use them to productive ends. And there are jammy elements, but I'd hate to call any of them jam bands. And there's a lot of melodrama, but — well, okay, there's just a lot of melodrama, I just don't care. I belong to a generation that shed tears when Optimus Prime died — I'm always ready to be emotionally manipulated.

I've been a bad blogger recently, but I've got a few semi-nifty technical projects in the works. Hopefully I'll be able to wrap one or two of em up tonight; stay tuned.

Also, the tag links aren't working anymore, if anyone cares — looks like Google crawling them was slowing down my webhost's machine so much that they disabled it. I'll probably just ditch the tags completely.
