Sick days: not as bad as they could be. It's true that I still sort of feel like I'm breathing through a tiny, phlegmy drinking straw. But there's a lot to be said for spending a day in your pajamas a scant few feet from a chocolate cake. Plus I got kind of a lot of work done. It's really made me miss the heady days of telecommuting to my considerably stupider but also more hygiene-optional last job.

But all's not well in the world. I'll issue this qualification: I really like the stuff that `BYT <http://www.brightestyoungthings.com/>`__/`Garutachi <http://www.myspace.com/garutachi>`__ is doing — seems decidedly too cool for the likes of me, but I'm glad there's a distinct party scene in this city that's concerned with things other than `date rape and boat shoes <http://wonkette.com/politics/last-week's-shots/>`__. Still, I wasn't pleased to see `this <http://wonkette.com/photogallery/garutachi/>`__. I find it extremely depressing that the only thing still keeping DC safely out of `Blue States Lose <http://gawker.com/news/blue-states-lose/>`__ eligibility is the fact that we're not a state.
