`Torrentfreak says <http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Torrentfreak/~3/177397467/>`__ that `Day Watch <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0409904/>`__ is the number one DVD rip on the internet. Weird! Not so much because it reflects non-US internet use (there's a reason LiveJournal is still around, after all), but because Emily and I downloaded an English-subtitled version back in August that sure *looked* like a DVD rip. What gives?

While I'm mentioning potential Hallomedia (and before my chance completely slips by), give this track a listen — it's the best of a well-intentioned but mostly-awful `Halloween mashup compilation <http://www.solcofn.com/Halloween.htm>`__:

   `Cheekyboy – Halloween with Morrissey <http://www.solcofn.com/media/Son%20of%20Monster%20Mash/7.%20Halloween%20with%20morrissey%20-%20Cheekyboy.mp3>`__

`Kyle <http://www.informationleafblower.com>`__ is *actually* spending Halloween with Morrissey. This is the next best thing.
