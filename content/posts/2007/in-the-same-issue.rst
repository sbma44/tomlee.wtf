I wouldn't normally beat a dead horse like this, but this is not only a subhead, but from the same issue as the `last quote I bitched about <http://www.manifestdensity.net/2007/01/18/get_got/>`__ (the issue's been lying around the office, and I've been slowly flipping through it). The prominence of this apparent typo is giving me pause, making me wonder if either a) I'm badly confused about the proper use of the verb "got"; or b) this reflects some new and wholly intentional editorial policy at Time. Anyway: huh.
