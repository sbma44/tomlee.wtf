|a high unread message count in gmail, mail.app and net news wire|\ The west coast was great — more on that later. Right now I'm in Austin for `SXSWi <http://2007.sxsw.com/interactive/>`__ and, as you can see, I'm a bit behind on things.

I've got a ton of photos and lame California jokes that I intend to put online, but at the moment I'm occuppied with blogging over at `sxsw.echoditto.com <http://sxsw.echoditto.com>`__ — head on over and have a look, if you'd like.
