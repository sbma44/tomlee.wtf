I got mentioned in a `Newsweek piece about the Wii <http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16720747/site/newsweek/>`__, thanks to a connection of `Sommer <http://cruelsommer.blogspot.com>`__'s (she's quoted in the article). Yay media conspiracy!

**UPDATE:** I got some quotes in the author's `associated blog entry <http://ncroal.talk.newsweek.com/default.asp?item=448169>`__.
