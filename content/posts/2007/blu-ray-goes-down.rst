The Register `reports <http://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/01/23/blu-ray_drm_cracked/>`__ that the Blu-Ray format has been compromised by the same guy that `cracked HD-DVD's copy protection </2007/01/03/more-on-the-aacs-exploit/>`__.

This isn't a huge surprise, since both formats use the same underlying copy protection system. Still, it's good to see. Sony can't be trusted with media formats — their instinct is to lock consumers into them for the greater glory of Sony. I was worried that the downside to the HD-DVD crack would be greater enthusiasm for Blu-Ray. Now that both have been cracked, it's a fair fight once again.
