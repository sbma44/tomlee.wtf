First, a discussion of `Dostoyevsky's epilepsy <http://neurophilosophy.wordpress.com/2007/04/16/diagnosing-dostoyevskys-epilepsy/>`__. I haven't got much to add; it's interesting stuff, though.

Second, `this article on Numenta <http://www.spectrum.ieee.org/apr07/4982/1>`__, the brain-like computing startup from one of the guys behind Palm and Treo. I'd read `this Wired article <http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/15.03/hawkins.html>`__ on the startup a little while ago. What they're doing is interesting, and I'm sure they've got some very smart people working for them. But in both articles Hawkins takes pains to poo-poo neural networks as a failed AI technology, and to distance his own "HTMs" from them. Yet after reading the descriptions of his technology (and the training and parameter-tuning it requires) and accounts of the sorts of tasks that HTMs can perform, the tech sounds a *lot* like multilayer `perceptrons <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron>`__. The dog-identifying tasks he points to are really just a more advanced case of the sorts of problems they had us solve in Intro to Neural Networks.

I'm all for moving beginner toolkits out of Matlab and into the open source world — I'm excited about Numenta, and hope it does well. But there's no reason to put down the accomplishments of those who came before you when what you're doing seems to be a variation on the techniques they pioneered.
