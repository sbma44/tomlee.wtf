John Allison, the author of the excellent webcomic `Scary Go Round <http://www.scarygoround.com>`__, is `asking <http://sgrblog.blogspot.com/2007/08/so-cruel-internet.html>`__ for fake letters for his new book. They need to be about ghosts and in the style of the New Yorker letters page. That sounds pretty good, right?
