We get some really excellent toys in the office. It's almost entirely `Nicco's <http://www.nicco.org>`__ fault (although I've been lobbying to get one of `these <http://www.thinkgeek.com/geektoys/warfare/86b8/>`__ ever since `April <http://dcist.com/staff.php#dcist_april>`__ told me they can be run from Linux).

This one's probably my favorite so far. Unfortunately the cranking mechanism isn't timed quite right, and the donuts usually end up sliding off Homer's mouth instead of down his gullet and into the collection tray. It's still pretty great, though.
