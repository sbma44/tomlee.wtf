Attention TechCrunch: `flash VOIP phones <http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/12/03/tringme-develops-its-own-flash-phone/>`__ have existed since at least 1999. I distinctly remember using Dialpad to make free domestic phone calls through my browser (Dialpad was subsequently made non-free and acquired by Yahoo). Now it's almost a decade later and we're getting excited about the same stupid technology and same stupid business model. No doubt they have an API and a Facebook application, though, so we can pretend it's *totally different*.

God, the internet is stupid. If you're not reading `uncov <http://www.uncov.com>`__, you'd really better start.
