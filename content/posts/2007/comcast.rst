If you're at all interested in the latest developments in the battle between Comcast and Bittorrent users or, even more perversely, want to know what I think about the matter, head over to `The Technology Liberation Front <http://www.techliberation.com/>`__. The TLF folks have been doing a fine job on the issue (as usual), and I've been spending my Comcast-related energies in their comment section. Head over there and fight with me about the DOCSIS cablemodem standard, why don't you?
