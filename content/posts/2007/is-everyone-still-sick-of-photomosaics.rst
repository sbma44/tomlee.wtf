No? Good:

|DC Flag Photomosaic|

| The source images are the 22,000some photos tagged with
| "dcist" on Flickr. I was getting ready to do this with `metapixel <http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/schani/metapixel/>`__ and a custom script, but today (via `TUAW <http://www.tuaw.com>`__) I stumbled over the horribly-named `MacOSaiX <http://homepage.mac.com/knarf/MacOSaiX/>`__, which did exactly what I wanted. Neat.

All of this is occasioned by my Q+!U DC flag t-shirt getting worn-out enough to cross over into the "gymwear" category. Well, that and this video:

A new flag-themed t-shirt is in order, and doing something with Spreadshirt seems like a good idea. So I whipped up a couple of illustrator files — if you want them, here you go. I've certainly found myself wanting a high-quality vector version of the flag before. But then, I may have to come up with more graphics for DCist than the average internet user...

- `DC Flag (accurate) </static/2007/04/30/dc_flag.ai>`__
- `DC Flag (squashed into a snazzier configuration) </static/2007/04/30/dc_flag_narrow.ai>`__

I was thinking of redoing the flag in ASCII but, like my `last project </2007/01/17/asciimation/>`__ along these lines, the early returns are a little underwhelming:

On the other hand, this music video makes me think that the idea is sound — it's just my execution that's off. Check it out, the ASCII starts about halfway through and is pretty neat.
