C|Net's got a `very good writeup <http://www.cnet.com/8301-13739_1-9781162-46.html>`__ of the situation that owners of hacked iPhones face now that Steve Jobs has said Apple won't simply tolerate their antics. It's unclear how diligent Apple will actually be when it comes to fighting this battle — Jobs is very good at sounding soothing and then delivering nothing — but it seems likely that Apple will at least make a superficial effort to make life difficult for the more high-profile sources of phone-hacking software.

None of this is likely to matter much to iPhone users who know how to use Bittorrent and IRC, however. If Apple got serious about the effort I could imagine users getting locked out of firmware upgrades and iTunes use (lest they lose their hacked functionality permanently). AT&T might also start preventing nonstandard apps from using their network. The former seems likely to me; the latter, not so much.
