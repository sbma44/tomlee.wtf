`Yglesias <http://matthewyglesias.theatlantic.com/archives/2007/10/brooks_on_huckabee.php>`__ prompted me to read `David Brooks' column on Mike Huckabee <http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/19/opinion/19brooks.html?_r=1&hp&oref=slogin>`__. America America aw shucks apparently-not-diabolical. Fine. But what's this?

   [Huckabee] tells audiences that the only soap his family could afford was the rough Lava soap, and that he was in college before he realized showering didnâ€™t have to hurt. "There are people paying $150 for an exfoliation," he jokes. "I could just hand them a bar of Lava soap."

He's right about one thing: Lava soap is pretty rough. My dad often had some of their products around the house for cleaning grease off of his hands, and it was definitely not something you'd use without noticing. But that's because it's supposed to be that way — *it's got little bits of pumice mixed in*.

Anyway what's this bullshit about it being cheap? Lava is a highly specialized utility soap, and one would expect it to command a premium. Clearly, this calls for some internet research. I compared prices for Lava versus Irish Spring — a nice, middle-of-the-road soap used by right-thinking Americans such as myself. A NOTE ON METHODOLOGICAL RIGOR: Lava is mostly sold as single bars. On the web, Irish Spring tends to be sold in 3-packs, so I've divided its prices by the number of bars. Surely a hardscrabble, cost-conscious family like the Huckabees would've bought in bulk.

The best price I could find for Lava was on Amazon — if you buy the `48-pack <http://www.amazon.com/oz-Lava-Bar-Soap-LAVA/dp/B0002ZW79U/ref=pd_bbs_2/105-2434525-4440409?ie=UTF8&s=hpc&qid=1192836726&sr=8-2>`__ you can get it for $0.89/bar. But that's still more expensive than retail amounts of Irish Spring, and the package is suspiciously green. If you're really looking for budget soap you can do considerably better than that. Or you could simply pass horse urine through straw and mix with lard. You *do* slaughter your own pigs, don't you?

So what can we conclude from all of this? I think there are two possibilities. Either Mike Huckabee is a compulsive liar and therefore completely unfit for office; or the Huckabee family has some sort of hereditary economic disability. The latter could perhaps account for his otherwise inexplicable enthusiasm for raising taxes sometimes, slightly. Either way, it's important that he be exposed for the confused old man and/or transparent fraud that he is. Has anything been done with the word "Huckster" yet?

This is the most obviously despicable campaign trail behavior since John Kerry's 2004 cheesesteak pandering. I expect the next Youtube debate to feature AT LEAST one soap-related question.
