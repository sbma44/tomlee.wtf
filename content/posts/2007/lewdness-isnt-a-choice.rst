Emily's signed up for the Club For Growth's email list and seems to really enjoy it. I didn't really understand why, and instead simply chalked it up to the Norquistian charisma that some of my other friends have fallen for.

But now I've got my own Club For Growth equivalent, and I think I understand the perverse pleasure she gets from reading awful emails. Particularly when they're obsessed with perversity.

To wit, let me highly recommend the American Family Association's Action Alerts list. It's been delivering hilariously homophobic gems to my inbox ever since `Amanda's post <http://blogstretch.blogspot.com/2007/04/little-ambush.html>`__ got me to sign their survey in support of the gay agenda. I don't think I'm ready to give them my real email address, but last night's `amusingly terrified list of sexual orientations <http://www.afa.net/sexualorientations.asp>`__ convinced me to re-up their `SpamGourmet <http://www.spamgourmet.com>`__ bucket. Heed the words of founder and chairman Donald E. Wildmon says, "Warning! This listing is offensive."

Still, to their credit and my immense surprise, Google seems to think that the term *telephone scatalogia* isn't an AFA creation. Might be time to add Latin to the required coursework for a degree in Gender & Sexuality Studies, academy — if you ask me, T.S. is considerably stupider-sounding than the faux-Latin in the Harry Potter books. Trust me, it's much easier to cow people into intellectual submission if they can't understand what the hell you're talking about. Why do you think we geeks come up with so many acronyms?
