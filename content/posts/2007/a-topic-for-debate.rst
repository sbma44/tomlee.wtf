RESOLVED: `Toto's "Africa" <http://hypem.com/search/toto%20africa/1/>`__ would make for a great Arcade Fire cover.

I'll withhold my irrefutable proof of this assertion until you've had a little time to digest it.

(Relatedly, have we all now officially dropped the "The" in front of (T)AF's name? I rewrote this post's first sentence because I'm no longer sure.)

**TOTALLY COINCIDENTALLY:** Looks like `Julian <http://juliansanchez.com/notes/archives/2007/06/tricks_memory_plays.php>`__ is talking about covers, too, if you'd like to discuss the issue non-hypothetically.
