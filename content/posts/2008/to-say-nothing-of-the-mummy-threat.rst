Sure, harvesting the organs of executed criminals `sounds <http://matthewyglesias.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/02/bitter_harvest.php>`__ like pleasant and morally unproblematic work. But Matt is ignoring the lessons of `John Carpenter Presents Body Bags <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_Bags_%28TV_Movie%29>`__, *Treehouse of Horror IX*, and, in a somewhat broader sense, *Nightmare on Elm Street*, *Idle Hands*, Jessica Alba's upcoming movie *The Eye* and any number of other supernaturally-themed transplant films (some of them no doubt inspired by real events).

In general postmortem recidivism is a topic that's too often left unacknowledged by the prison reform movement.

**UPDATE:** The Nabob `reminds me <http://pygmalioninablanket.blogspot.com/2008/02/to-say-nothing-of-revengeful-zombie.html>`__ of `Body Parts <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101492/>`__, an argument for my thesis that I had inexplicably ignored. If the Q. wasn't already E.D.-ed, surely it must now be considered so.
