Looks like `the labels went after Muxtape <http://www.muxtape.com/>`__ faster than `I'd expected </2008/03/27/muxtape-unraveled/>`__. Relaunching as a direct competitor to MySpace's music player functionality strikes me as a smart move — the fidelity offered by MySpace is pretty terrible, and bands are willing to spend a few bucks, I think, for better promotional tools. There are plenty other services out there that scratch this itch, but most haven't got the brand cachet or design sense of Muxtape. I think this could turn into a nice little business for Justin, the site's creator.

On a side note, reading about the licensing challenges faced by Justin should underscore the impressiveness of the `Hype Machine <http://hypem.com>`__'s continued existence. I don't know the details of whatever arrangement Anthony worked out, but he obviously did it a while ago, when the labels were presumably less resigned to the importance of the internet. The Muxtape saga shows that threading this particular needle is still a difficult task; it must have been nearly impossible when HypeM did it.
