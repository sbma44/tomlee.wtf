|these are the chips|

I meant to post this important news earlier, but forgot. Now, shocked back into attention by an outpouring of public interest on Flickr (a comment was left), let me try to make up for lost time.

It has, `according to Wikipedia <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potato_chip#Seasoned_chips>`__, taken us almost a century to get here. But we have arrived at a solution: Carolina-style Utz chips. These are the chips, people.

I realize that regional pride might propel some of you toward Crab Chips. But you're better than that. Crab Chips are a mirthless joke, an exaggerated accent, a story they tell to tourists.

The Carolina-style chip is a precise equation, a `tensegrity tower <http://www.uni-kassel.de/fb14/stahlbau/tensegrity/tens.html>`__ constructed from flavored powder: half barbecue, half salt & vinegar. Its elegance cannot be overstated, although that elegance may not be completely apparent if you cram them into your mouth with the same enthusiasm I do.
