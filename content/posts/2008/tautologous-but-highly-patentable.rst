From `Derek Lowe's blog <http://pipeline.corante.com/archives/2008/02/27/antidepressants_depressing_news_or_not.php>`__:

   The actual mechanism of the placebo effect is a field of great interest and potentially great importance.

That's right: someday soon scientists may be working to develop a pill that can mimic the placebo effect.

Personally, I find this immensely cheering. I think I love this universe the most when it's operating at maximum ridiculousness.
