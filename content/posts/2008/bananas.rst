|20080618_banana.jpg|\ Anyone who hasn't should go check out `Dan Koeppel's op-ed about our impending bananaclysm <http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/18/opinion/18koeppel.html?_r=2&ref=opinion&oref=slogin&oref=slogin>`__ in the New York Times. I bought `Koeppel's book <http://www.amazon.com/dp/product/1594630380/?tag=unrequitednar-20&linkCode=asn&creativeASIN=1594630380>`__ for Emily a while ago (she likes bananas!) and wound up reading it myself — it's good! Since then I've been walking around, using every opportunity I can find to ask, "Did you know that [fascinating fact about bananas]?" To which the answer is invariably "Yes, actually." But it's still an interesting book.
