I followed a link from Yglesias to `The Democratic Strategist <http://www.thedemocraticstrategist.org/strategist/2008/03/obama_and_the_death_of_the_sou_1.php>`__ and *christ* but that's an ugly header graphic. If I may, let me re-direct your attention to `this post <http://www.zunta.org/blog/archives/2006/04/07/graphic_violenc/>`__ that I wrote in 2006. For god's sake, people: PNG and GIF for high-contrast graphics; JPEG for photos.
