|stay_positive.png|\ The only thing I feel like writing about at the moment is how much it stinks to be sick and how much I'd rather be on my couch `assassinating people in the virtual Holy Land <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassin%27s_creed>`__. So instead, two brief pieces of internet advice as you seek worthwhile content elsewhere:

#. Update your RSS reader! Spencer has a `new home <http://attackerman.firedoglake.com/>`__ and a badass header. Don't let the weird teaser view (which begins after the third entry) bamboozle you into missing `this post <http://attackerman.firedoglake.com/2008/06/25/ludasmydudeimnottrynnadis/>`__, which I especially liked, and which also gives me a good excuse to link to `DCeiver's currently-running presidential ipod experiment <http://dceiver.blogspot.com/2008/06/experiment.html>`__.
#. Whatever you do, don't pay any attention to `Stereogum's review <http://stereogum.com/archives/premature-evaluation/premature-evaluation-the-hold-steady-stay-postitiv_010122.html>`__ of the new Hold Steady (now `available on iTunes <http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?id=282387319&s=143441>`__ thanks to the record company panicking over the leak). I admit I was slow on the uptake — it's much better than I initially thought it was, largely due to the band deciding to stick its best stuff in the album's second half.
   But I didn't get it as exactly backward as Stereogum does: "Sequestered in Memphis" is actually one of the album's weakest songs; "One for the Cutters" is probably the best, newest thing on the album; and "Constructive Summer" is fun and catchy but completely incidental. He's right about "Navy Sheets", though: it really is bad.
   Anyway, a much better take can be found at `Tiny Mixtapes <http://tinymixtapes.com/The-Hold-Steady,6426>`__. The only thing I'd add: neither review talks about the title track, which is understandable in that it only sort-of works on the record, but also too bad in that the anthemic, wistful "Stay Positive" seems poised to be an incredibly great song to hear live — something I intend to do as soon as I can.
