Curse them and their Olympic advertising:

- Does Visa really think this "only card accepted at the Olympics" business is a good idea? How many people hear that boast and think "Oh shit! Good thing I went with Visa — I'd hate to have to visit an ATM four years from now, maybe." My guess: fewer than the number that realize that Visa has taken their money and spent it on a) making other companies' customers' lives slightly less convenient and b) getting Morgan Freeman to relay that accomplishment to us.
- `Kath and Kim <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kath_%26_Kim_(U.S._TV_series)>`__. Maybe you'll be funny! You've got Selma Blair on your cast, and if someone's good enough for Hellboy she's good enough for me. But it's pathetically clear that you really, really want us to think you're like Arrested Development, sort of. And the shadow of Molly Shannon looms. I fear you, and for you.
