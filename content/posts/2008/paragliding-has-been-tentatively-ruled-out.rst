I'm in the market for a sport.

It used to be that I stayed in pretty good shape by going to the gym a hell of a lot. In college I'd make it four or five days a week — an undergraduate schedule and a lack of real hobbies besides binge drinking made this relatively easy. But as I've gotten older I've been spending more and more of my time sick\*, traveling, tired, working late or complaining about my knees. My post-work gym attendance has fallen off to about once a week (generously), and I'm increasingly unable to fool myself into thinking this will change.

Charles' boxing and yoga adventures have been an inspiration, too, and I think he's right when he says that I need to change up my routine. My short term goal is to find something I can do outside on weekends that'll actually get my heart rate up.

My longer term goal is more important, though: I want to find an activity that puts me on the path to one day being able to play the crazy old coot: the sinewy codger whose tanned hide hangs off his shoulders like a chieftain's furs, and who takes no greater pleasure in life than embarrassing the callow, pudgy fratboys who show up at his mountain/river/field, unaware that they are about to witness geriatric feats of strength and finesse.

It's ambitious, I know. But I think it's doable. My first thoughts are rock climbing and kayaking. I'm terrible at climbing, but know I enjoy it. I've done a lot of whitewater stuff, but never kayaking. The former seems a little cheaper, but right now I'm leaning toward the latter. Although the Potomac is disgusting, and climbing will probably lead to a more satisfyingly leathery payoff. So it's tough to say.

Anyway, I'd be glad to hear any suggestions from you, good people of the internet. All I know is that I don't want to be one of the weird old guys at the Y*\* who compete in endless handball ladders.

\* This includes now. Yes, I'm sick again.

\*\* Ask me sometime about the guy who either has Tourette's or listens to too much WTEM
