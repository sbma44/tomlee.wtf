Hi there. Have you been wondering where I am? No, probably not. But look, I was gone: to New Orleans, with the rest of the `EchoDitto <http://www.echoditto.com>`__ crew for our annual retreat, which this year happened to coincide with the beginning of Mardis Gras.

Prior to this trip all I knew about New Orleans came from `Hard Target <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107076/>`__ and `that one Radiohead song with the clarinet <http://hypem.com/search/radiohead%20glass%20house/1/>`__. Both proved to be reliable guides, although anyone preparing for a similar trip would also do well to review the scene at a frat party — ideally one attended by several hundred thousand people.

I have lots of stories to tell (two!), and will get to them as soon as I can. At the moment I'm too busy grappling with the fact that I enjoy and am inspired by `something affiliated with the Black Eyed Peas <http://yeswecansong.com>`__; also, pleasant exhaustion.
