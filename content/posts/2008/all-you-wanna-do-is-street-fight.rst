I only mentioned Man Factory's Street Fighter concept album `in passing </2008/09/15/music-at-least-some-of-which-is-not-about-videogames/>`__ at first, but having given it some more attention (and having done so at Ezra's recommendation), I feel like I should push it a little harder: it's pretty clever and catchy, and is really more of a straight-up rock opera than a mere concept album. Its brevity left me a bit confused at first, but I now see that this is just the first of `three planned "rounds" <http://blogs.dallasobserver.com/dc9/2008/06/man_factory_talks_street_fight.php>`__.

It's a `free download <http://students.uta.edu/tm/tmw7914/roundone.zip>`__ — what have you got to lose?
