*... or, "Kwisatz Haderacetylcholinergic Drug Alternatives"*

This `Rember <http://www.medpagetoday.com/MeetingCoverage/ICAD/tb/10320>`__ drug that's showing promising efficacy against Alzheimer's is really pretty exciting. For a long time I've had blind faith that my generation wouldn't have to face Alzheimer's, at least not the way folks currently do. I was hopeful that the solution would arrive in time for our parents, too — now it looks like it might.

The story behind the drug is interesting. Naturally, `Derek Lowe <http://pipeline.corante.com/archives/2008/07/31/rember_for_alzheimers_methylene_blues_comeback.php>`__ is the place to go for an informed perspective on the matter. He (and `Wired <http://blog.wired.com/wiredscience/2008/07/new-alzheimers.html>`__) both note that Rember is actually a very old drug: Methylene Blue, which has been used for everything from malaria to psychiatric disorders to intestinal surgery. It's got a long history and seems to be quite safe.

But it is very, very blue. And that leads to some side effects. From `the Wikipedia article <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylene_blue>`__:

   Methylene blue was used at the end of the century as a successful treatment for malaria. It disappeared as an anti-malarial during the wars in Asia, as U.S. soldiers disliked its two inevitable, fully reversible side effects: green urine and blue sclera.

Blue sclera — as in the used-to-be-whites of your eyes. So yes: grandma might remain mentally sharp, but she's going to look like she just wandered off the set of *Dune*. Awesome.

Presumably the drug can be used synergistically with the `Juice of Saphoo <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapho_juice>`__.
