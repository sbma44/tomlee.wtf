Tonight! Black Cat! Word on the inter-street is that they go on around 11 — that's right, it's a headlining spot. I think I'll be in the Red Room by 10 or so. See you there? Of course I will.

**CORRECTION:** A more recent notice from the band says they may be on as early as 10:30. Are they just saying that to make your dilatory ass show up on time? It's hard to fathom their mysterious ways.
