For those interested, `here's the announcement site <http://subsidyscope.com/>`__ for the project I'm working on. There's not much there yet besides a description of the project, and sadly I can't take credit for the site as it currently exists — my coworkers Jeremy and Kerry deserve the credit for that slick JQuery slider thingy — but it does explain what we're trying to do. The whole project officially launched yesterday.
