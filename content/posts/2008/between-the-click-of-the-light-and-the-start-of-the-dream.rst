I feel like I'm waking up. That probably sounds grandiose — that's not what I mean. Yes, I'm excited about last night's win and what it means for the country. I'm very ready to be rid of the stomach-sinking thought that my government is torturing people on my behalf. But the election's primary effect on my state of mind has just been to make me feel embarrassingly maudlin every quarter-hour. It doesn't really account for my present disorientation.

That sensation has more to do with how much *stuff* it feels like I've been doing. Some of it was about the election, but an embarrassing amount was Halloween-related. I enjoy that holiday to an extent that can only be described as idiotic, and I probably took on a bit too much this year. Still, the smoke chillers and corpsed skeleton are now safely stored for next year's installment — an undefined project that I currently find incredibly daunting, and yet already know will have to involve animatronics.

But for now: a return to routine. A wait for the inauguration. Early bedtimes!

First, though, some photos. I managed to take exactly none during the Halloween party, but a bunch of other people did — you can find 'em `here <http://flickr.com/photos/tags/fickeween>`__, if you haven't already. And here's a shot of me and Emily:

I have to cherish whatever opportunities I can find to be the one in this relationship called "doctor".

More topical: last night's celebration on U Street. Wherever you were when you heard the news last night, I hope there was as much joy on hand as there was in DC.
