`Tim Wu makes the case for Olympic weightlifting <http://www.slate.com/id/2197254/entry/2197698/>`__. I'm convinced. But then, I already was — it's the only sport I've bothered to watch via NBC's Silverlight-powered online interface. Wu does a nice job of explaining to me why I find it so compelling, although he neglects to mention that `one of the competitors is a member of the Latvian parliament <http://www.reuters.com/article/GCA-Olympics/idUSSP3940220080801?sp=true>`__, which is just *awesome*.
