Yes, `this is pretty dispiriting <http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/technology/2008/08/iphone-i-am-ric.html>`__: an iPhone app that does nothing but cost $999 dollars managed to rack up eight purchases before Apple yanked it. Amusingly, those who've jailbroken the new 2.0 firmware have had access to a copycat app since yesterday. It makes me sort of wish Apple hadn't pulled the app — now the free app won't proliferate and those eight dopes will be able to continue to enjoy showcasing their elite levels of wealth/idiocy.
