Roku has `complied with the GPL <http://www.roku.com/community/gpl_nfp.php>`__ and `released the source code <http://www.hackaday.com/2008/07/02/netflix-player-source-code-released/>`__ to its new Netflix set top box. This is the big step toward hackers breaking the thing open and loading custom software onto it, which would be pretty great. A `wifi-enabled STB with HDMI output <http://forums.roku.com/viewtopic.php?t=16685&postdays=0&postorder=asc&start=0>`__ would, if untethered from Netflix, be a steal at $100. My hacked Xbox 1 performs (or performed) a similar function, streaming video from a drive on my network. But it's not capable of HD resolutions.

Actually, it's not an `ARM processor <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture>`__. But the real chipset wouldn't have provided a title that affords nearly so much smug self-satisfaction.
