`Via DCeiver <http://dceiver.blogspot.com/2008/03/give-me-leonard-cohen-afterworld.html>`__, a `fantastic accounting of the song "Hallelujah"'s evolution, from Leonard Cohen to Fallout Boy <http://www.clapclap.org/2007/04/hallelujah.html>`__. The afterword kind of spirals out of control, trying to simultaneously take potshots at Jeff Buckley and repeatedly assert that The OC's cultural primacy allows it to transcend authenticity. But it, too, is worth reading if only because it's that rarest of beasts (perpetually hunted by `Charles <http://thecityveins.com>`__): music criticism that actually talks about music.
