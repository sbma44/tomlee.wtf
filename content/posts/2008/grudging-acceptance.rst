Last night's `Samantha Brown <http://www.travelchannel.com/TV_Shows/Samantha_Brown>`__ episode about DC: actually pretty good. I suppose it ought to have been, since the Travel Channel is based in Chevy Chase. Still, it was kind of surprising to see someone do a not half-bad job representing the city. Brown herself is charming and funny, and I hear she killed Andrew Zimmern in personal combat in order to land her own show. Hell, I would've given her a show for any two of those three.
