If you don't own a TV, go buy one. This way you'll never be tempted to `unnecessarily mention <http://twitter.com/jack/statuses/865549943>`__ that you don't own a television, preventing everyone else from thinking you're a supercilious jackass.

If you don't own a TV and are able to refrain from relating this fact, then, uh, carry on.

**TO CLARIFY:** You don't have to watch it, of course. That's your call. But by owning a television, most attempts to proudly explain your aversion to the medium will become so bogged down in qualifiers that they'll never escape your lips. This will be well worth the `$19 investment <http://www.directdepot.net/product_info.php?products_id=6904>`__.

**ALSO:** `Obligatory Onion reference <http://www.theonion.com/content/node/28694>`__.
