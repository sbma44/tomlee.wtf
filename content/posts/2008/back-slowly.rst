Well, it's been a pretty restful holiday break, but tomorrow it all ends. This past week or so of vacation has been disappointingly unproductive — I barely got to the gym at all, I didn't really write anything, and I only made minor progress on the two technical projects I had in mind. In fact, I spent an amazingly small amount of time online. If you're one of the people to whom I should've been writing emails, I apologize.

But I did manage to get to a hell of a lot of parties, see a number of old friends (albeit not as many as I would've liked) and wake up on New Year's Day feeling like I was probably not going to die after all (better yet, I didn't even want to!). Pretty good, all in all.

Anyway, all I really mean to say here is that I'm looking forward to returning to routine. I'm hoping that 2008 is bloggier, healthier and even more fun than 2007 was.
