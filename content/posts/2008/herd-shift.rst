So where can I sign up for more timely updates from the media conspiracy? I'm imagining an email list. Or maybe a dashboard widget with Growl notifications telling me when and how to unfairly marginalize the Ron Paul campaign.

When I went to bed last night, MSNBC had begun expressing doubts about Senator Clinton's prospects. But that was it! By this morning the floodgates had opened and suddenly everyone is willing to acknowledge what has been true for weeks: that there's really no way for her to catch up that doesn't involve people taking to the streets. It really is striking, bizarre, and a bit frightening to see how suddenly, uniformly and arbitrarily this change occurred. The most generous interpretation is that after one or two people risked embarrassment by acknowledging the actual situation, everyone else felt free to adopt the new storyline.

Without the fourth estate to help it play make-believe, I guess it's unlikely that the Clinton campaign is long for this world. That's fine by me. But I'm still a little bitter: I'd gotten pretty good at writing rote, despairing `morning roundup <http://dcist.com/2008/05/07/morning_roundup_252.php>`__ introductions about the primary campaign's interminability. When I woke up this morning and rescanned the headlines I had to throw away a rather clever paragraph. Sucks!

So please: a little more warning next time the media conspiracy suddenly and arbitrarily shifts direction — those of us at the distant bottom of the org chart would really appreciate it. Maybe you guys could set up a Google Calendar or something.
