|20080630_homebrewing.jpg|\ Emily has already `chronicled <http://www.movering.com/node/546>`__ what was a pretty fantastic Philadelphia weekend. So I'll just second the `Philadelphia Brewing Company <http://philadelphiabrewing.com/>`__ tour: it's free and fascinating, and, as you might imagine, comes with beer. Their Kenzinger is so embarrassingly good that I'm thinking seriously about how to get a case down to DC.

Naturally, though, all the talk about mash tuns and wort got me thinking about giving homebrewing a try. I know, I know: it's not a money saver. It'll smell. My beer will be just okay, and my friends will quickly get sick of drinking it. But it sounds fun! And I have a garage, which should help contain the unpleasantness. Besides, at the hipster flea market Emily and I bought `this book <http://www.amazon.com/dp/product/0882669400/?tag=unrequitednar-20&linkCode=asn&creativeASIN=0882669400>`__ (rescued from among piles of ironic VHS tapes, ironic video game accessories, and ironic Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles merchanise). So really, what choice do I have?

But I could use some advice, o people of the internet. I've assisted a friend with siphoning and bottling before, but that was in the distant past. More recently I had a look at some of `these videos <http://www.monkeysee.com/hoptech>`__ and found myself mostly-convinced by the claims associated with the `beginner's kit <http://www.hoptech.com/cart/cart.php?target=product&product_id=16133&category_id=3>`__ that they're pitching. Anybody have any other sage wisdom for me?
