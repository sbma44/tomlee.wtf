Remember `how awesome it is that Lady Ada's Boarduino is tiny and only costs $17.50 <http://www.manifestdensity.net/2008/04/16/boarduino/>`__? Well, the `DuinoStamp <http://www.spiffie.org/kits/duinostamp/>`__ is even smaller and only $10. Woo! You'll need to provide your own 5v power supply and USB programming cable, but that's easy enough.
