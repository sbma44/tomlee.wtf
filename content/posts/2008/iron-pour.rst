Hey! `I went there <http://dcist.com/2008/12/21/post_8.php>`__!

|iron pour!|

Kriston was nice enough to invite me along to the UMD iron pour. If you get a chance to attend a similar gathering, I strongly recommend that you do. It was bitterly cold, so we didn't exactly linger. But the sulfurous stink of burning coal, the sight of underqualified undergrads poking at the fiery slag hole, and the general atmosphere of nervous excitement all combined to satisfyingly deadly effect.
