I've been meaning to link to this for a while but kept forgetting: a while ago `John <http://nedward.org>`__ (who I met at SXSW last year) and his girlfriend `Lisa <http://flickr.com/photos/presley/>`__ went to have lunch with her grandfather, who used to wrestle in Japan as `The Destroyer <http://www.thedestroyer.com/>`__. Along with `a pretty interesting/amusing post about it <http://nedward.org/2008/01/27/lunch-with-the-destroyer/>`__, John posted this video, which I highly recommend:

It's a video of The Destroyer wrestling a bear, with commentary from the man himself. I think you'll agree he makes a compelling case that that bear should've been disqualified.
