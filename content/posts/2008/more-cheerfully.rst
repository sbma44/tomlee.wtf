You might want to go check out `Emily's first batch of photos from Jeff and Marie's wedding <http://flickr.com/photos/ethorson/tags/jeffandmarieswedding/>`__, which include a number of shots of me looking pre-tty stupid. I seem to have lost my camera somewhere between DC and the beach — it sufficiently close to death that I can't say I'm too broken up about it — but while I wish I could supplement them, the pictures Emily took are more than enough to convey just how beautiful the wedding was.

`Marie and Jeff <http://www.jeffnye.org/wedding/2008/06/survive_wedding_check.php>`__ rented a gorgeous house in the middle of a bunch of vineyards in the middle of wine country in the middle of a state that's so beautiful it seems like it must be cheating. There were a number of high notes: driving down the coast in a rented convertible; lots of delicious food, wine and beer; hours spent playing an inscrutable German board game; Jon stripping down and jumping in the pool near the end of the reception. Arguably more importantly, the bride and groom are great for each other, and have been for a while now. They seemed to actually enjoy the wedding while simultaneously making sure that their guests did, too, which seemed like a pretty impressive accomplishment.

All in all: a huge success. Way to go, guys.
