`Ezra <http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/ezraklein_archive?month=02&year=2008&base_name=the_future_of_bookstores>`__ and `Matt <http://matthewyglesias.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/02/chain_bookstores.php>`__ are talking about chain versus independent bookstores. Ezra says:

   I keep trying to figure out a reason I believe bookstores will survive into the future, but it seems pretty clear that books will eventually be as mercilessly digitized as music, and most bookstores will close, just as most CD stores were shuttered long ago. Tell me why I'm wrong.

I agree with Ezra, so I don't really have anything to add except the suggestion that any answer to his question that includes the phrase "the way books smell" or variants thereof should be immediately disqualified.
