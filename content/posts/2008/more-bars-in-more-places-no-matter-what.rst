I like to think I've got a healthily cynical outlook on these sorts of things, so I'm not sure why this never occurred to me:

   The custom-rolled firmware from the US cellphone companies is also, of course, likely to tell fibs about signal strength. The telephony companies quickly realised that it's much cheaper to sell phones that show lots of signal all the time than to actually bother putting up more of those expensive cell towers. And, once again, the signal strength is not the same as the call quality. Lots of signal plus lots of noise is not as good as a little bit of signal plus almost no noise at all.

That's from the inimitable `Dan Rutter <http://www.dansdata.com/gz084.htm>`__, who, if you're interested at all in technology, you really should be reading.
