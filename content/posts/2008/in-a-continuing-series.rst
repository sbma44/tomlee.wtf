A 22 year-old woman on a bicycle `was run over and killed by a garbage truck this morning <http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/08/AR2008070800975.html>`__. Commenters in the `DCist thread <http://dcist.com/2008/07/08/woman_killed_by_garbage_truck_in_du.php#comments>`__ are speculating that she was in a bike lane, which makes sense given the location of the accident — the area north of Dupont is actually pretty bike-friendly by District standards.

Meanwhile, over at WTOP it took a `whopping five comments <http://wtop.com/index.php?nid=25&sid=1436169&comments=true#msg_4>`__ before someone began complaining about cyclists' behavior. Classy!

**UPDATE:** `Good <http://dcist.com/2008/07/08/woman_killed_by_garbage_truck_in_du.php#comment-1401482>`__ `stuff <http://dcist.com/2008/07/08/woman_killed_by_garbage_truck_in_du.php#comment-1401507>`__ later in the DCist thread, too. Cyclists really need to clean up their act — think of how that poor truck driver must be feeling!

**UPDATE 2:** Jake mentions in comments that he `rode past the scene of the accident <http://citizenjake.com/2008/07/08/an-awful-way-to-start-the-morning/>`__ this morning.
