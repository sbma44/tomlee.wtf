`Ryan <http://www.ryanavent.com/blog/?p=1410>`__ and `Ezra <http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/ezraklein_archive?month=09&year=2008&base_name=cracking_down_on_speeding>`__ and `Matt <http://feeds.feedburner.com/%7Er/matthewyglesias/%7E3/386908192/why_so_fast.php>`__ are talking about cars that can't go faster than 75 miles per hour, the idea being that mandating such a change would save lives. I'm not sure what to think about that. I probably shouldn't bother thinking much — the idea is clearly politically impossible.

But it's intriguing nonetheless. In particular, it's interesting to consider this theoretical speed limitation as an analogue of DRM — a means of crippling devices so that consumers don't misuse them. As you might imagine, I'm not a fan of conventional DRM. I think it's inevitably circumvented and accomplishes nothing other than inconveniencing users.

On the other hand, I do favor some sorts of restrictions on the devices that consumers can buy and that manufacturers would like to sell to them. I approve of some forms of gun control, for instance, including limitations on the mechanical capabilities of firearms. I think that such restrictions are less easily circumvented than copy protection, and of course the consequences of a single successful circumvention do not represent a system-wide failure in the way that they would within the digital realm. That makes the undertaking a bit more worthwhile in my eyes.

Cars fall somewhere in the middle. There's already a thriving hobbyist scene devoted to swapping out engine timing chips for less efficient, more powerful alternatives. And of course more generally there's a ton of aftermarket automotive components that performance tuners can buy. I have no doubt that speed restrictors, however implemented, would be easily beaten by motivated individuals.

But would the inconvenience of upgrading from the default limitation save lives? Probably. I'm not sure how many, though, and it's conceivable that a speed limitation may cause deaths in ways that this debate's participants aren't anticipating. I remain generally suspicious of efforts to cripple devices that consumers can buy.

Mostly unrelatedly, during some preparatory spooky-story reading this weekend I came across this quotation from `The Gold-Bug <http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-new2?id=PoeGold.sgm&images=images/modeng&data=/texts/english/modeng/parsed&tag=public&part=1&division=div1>`__, which I thought sums up the DRM situation pretty nicely:

   [I]t may well be doubted whether human ingenuity can construct an enigma of the kind which human ingenuity may not, by proper application, resolve.

Until recently public key cryptography arguably provided a counterexample, but quantum computing seems poised to prove Poe right once again.
