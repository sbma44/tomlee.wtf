son1 has written `a post <http://bayes.wordpress.com/2008/11/18/color-me-bad/>`__ that continues the discussion I began around `colors and data visualization </2008/11/08/coloring-your-opinion/>`__, and I'm jealous of it for two reasons. First, I can't believe I didn't think of and claim that post title for myself, because it's perfect.

Second, he does a much better job of getting to the heart of what I was trying to express: that a surprisingly large amount of data visualizations are both correct and question-begging. The choices made by the creator will inevitably influence which conclusions are drawn. That isn't to malign the idea of graphs and charts and maps — at their best they are arguments that contain all component data, and whose accuracy can be easily checked. But they're still arguments.

Perhaps all this stuff has been said before and better by Tufte, but those books are expensive, dammit.
