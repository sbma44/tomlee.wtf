No sooner had I finished writing a long post for Techdirt about Comcast seeing the light on Bittorrent than I stumble across `two <http://www.multichannel.com/index.asp?layout=blog&blog_id=100000410&blog_post_id=1150024115>`__ `links <http://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/showthread.php?t=1008271>`__ (via `Slashdot <http://slashdot.org>`__) showing just how miserably the company treats its digital cable customers. Comcast recompresses their channels so that they can squeeze more over the network without making infrastructure improvements. The result is substantially worse than FiOS or over-the-air broadcasts. Go ahead: click the links and check out the pictures.
