I know, I know: two YouTube videos in one day? But `this <http://urbanplanningblog.com/2008/06/18/boarding-a-train-that-doesnt-stop/>`__ is really neat:

Of course, the design is also a bit impractical: got any existing tunnels or stations? Well, I hope you've got a lot of money, too, because you're going to have to rebuild them all.

But it strikes me (the person who knows nothing about trains) as a potentially feasible idea if implemented by simply delinking individual cars. New cars could be brought up to speed by an engine that hangs around a given city, accelerating passengers, connecting them to passing trains and then heading back to repeat the process. Disconnected cars could coast into station or be picked up by such a system. You'd have to figure out the right car to sit in based on your destination, but the upside would be to make every train an express.

The downside is no doubt the complexity involved in synchronizing speeds so precisely as to make such a system safe. But surely it must be possible — after all, this is a problem that's been well-addressed for `over a hundred years <http://youtube.com/watch?v=ALu7dxP5fao>`__.

(The train link comes via Chris via the `EchoDitto del.icio.us feed <http://del.icio.us/echoditto>`__ which I'll immodestly point out often has interesting stuff in it.)
