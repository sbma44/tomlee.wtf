I was remiss in not posting this earlier: a bunch of friends have started up `The Internet Food Association <http://internetfoodassociation.wordpress.com/>`__, and have been nice enough to ask me (end Emily, and probably other people you know) to contribute to it. If you think you might enjoy hearing me hold forth pretentiously about beer, go subscribe to the feed.
