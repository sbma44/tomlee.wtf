Via `Peter <http://www.theamericanscene.com/>`__, I see that `Apple is rumored to be introducing aluminum Macbooks <http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/08/04/07/apple_notebook_lines_to_see_major_design_changes_sources_say.html>`__. Great! I think aluminum looks cooler, and it may even dissipate heat better (although, somewhat counterintuitively, it seems to make for less durable computers).

But are they really trying to claim that an aluminum shell is somehow more ecologically friendly than a plastic one? I mean, yes, aluminum can be recycled. But it consumes a *huge* amount of energy to produce aluminum in the first place. If we're considering carbon footprint as part of our ecological assessment, the plastic case almost certainly comes out on top.

It probably doesn't matter too much either way. The case is the least environmentally problematic part of the computer. Apple is `RoHS-compliant <http://www.apple.com/hotnews/agreenerapple/>`__, so they're doing what they can with respect to the internals, but that's still a much bigger issue than what the shell is made of.
