First things first: the City Veins were really, really great on Friday, and if you missed them I'm sorry. Their set seemed a little short and was definitely early, but man was it great. Special guest stars Kriston, Tim-who-I-don't-know, and Tom from These United States (henceforth: Tom\ :sub:`TUS`) added a new dimension to songs that by now I know pretty well. Having heard this band start as a four-piece then refactor their sound and songs when Adam left, it was interesting to hear them return to a surplus of manpower. Interesting and nice!

I seem to have lost my camera and these days Emily's mostly spends its time making deeply pathetic whirring sounds, but friend-of-the-band dotslinesandpolygons took some `great photos <http://flickr.com/photos/dotslinesandpolygons/sets/72157605507879155/>`__. More to the point, go `buy their CD <http://www.thecityveins.com/blog/>`__, why don't ya?

Now, to the boringly personal: I'm kind of surprised to find myself blogging right now rather than, say dead. Or traveling — the former would have been because of the latter. Because holy god, have I done a lot of it recently.

DC to Kitty Hawk for beach. Kitty Hawk to DC. DC to Sonoma for Jeff and Marie's wedding. Sonoma to DC. DC to San Francisco for work. San Francisco to DC. DC to Philadelphia. Philly to DC.

All of that happened over the course of the last *two weeks*, and there hasn't been more than 36 continuous hours spent in DC during it. Particular highlights included ten hours spent on an already-two-hours-delayed plane to SFO and a three hour trip back from Dulles right before the show on Friday.

Of course all of these trips were made in order to a) get drunk and have great meals with people dear to me or b) meet with interesting clients in a city with fantastic burritos. So I suppose I can't complain (the preceding notwithstanding). But holy hell am I glad that, aside from a Thursday meeting in NYC, the only travel I currently have planned will occur via bicycle.
