I realize I've already blogged about my `Arduino/Fonera project <http://www.manifestdensity.net/2008/03/26/dorkbot_arduino_and_fonera/>`__ far too much. But I don't think I've actually explained *what it does* in simple terms. If you're interested, a brief explanation of what it is and how it works is included in today's `DCist transit post <http://dcist.com/2008/04/10/transit_on_thur_27.php>`__. Special bonus: mean comments at my expense!

Now I'll shut up about it. Up next: something filled with shift registers, LEDs and childhood nostalgia.

(Although `this <http://www.tearsoffire.org/twiki/bin/view/Projects/SolarPendulum>`__ looks like a fun (and cheap) project, too.)
