Well, past assurances to the contrary, it turns out that I haven't really been blogging here. I will! Soon! But it's my first week on the new job, and I've been busy. Also, I've been tired: I've never been very good at waking up in the morning. At EchoDitto I'd come into work at 10 and leave around 6 or 7 or 8 if I needed to get something done. Sunlight operates on a more normal schedule, and while I've been managing to wake up without major difficulties, I haven't yet gotten this "go home/to bed slightly earlier" thing down yet. So I'm a little exhausted.

Things are going well, though. It's a bit lonesome in my office, but that'll be fixed as soon as I hire some folks (`Here's <http://www.transparencyjobs.com/jobs/56/>`__ the job listing for the first position we're hiring for, incidentally. I haven't yet posted the link anywhere else — it's a Manifest Density exclusive!). And as of yesterday I have an enormous whiteboard to keep me company, which is nice.

I've mostly just been getting acclimated: drafting some documents, going to meetings, and finding opportunities to familiarize myself with Sunlight's technology. You know how first weeks go. Everybody's been extremely friendly, and it's really great to have the latitude and time to figure out the right way to solve the problem we're facing.

I do have one complaint, though:

These bears are part of the winter display in the lobby, and they're really starting to freak me out.
