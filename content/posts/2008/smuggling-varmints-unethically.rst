I didn't see `this episode <http://pygmalioninablanket.blogspot.com/2007/11/thanksgiving-came-early-to-our-house.html>`__ so I can't say for sure, but the Law & Order: SVU that I just watched with Charles seems like a strong contender for greatest of all time. That's not saying much, of course, since Law & Order is a terrible, terrible franchise. Still, check out the plot summary as I related it to `Emily <http://movering.com>`__:

   | There was a girl found shot but then she wasn't but it turned out to be her twin, except then also she had tiger bites on her, so of course they figured it was the tiger of this rap star (played by the guy from Outkast), but DNA proved it wasn't, so then Big Boi says the girl was part of an exotic animal smuggling ring and takes Stabler to them posing as a customs official who wants to become corrupt, and he steals some hair and it was THAT TIGER, but then Big Boi gets eaten by hyenas (which we know because a CSI said "check out that hyena vomit" and his chain was in it) so then Stabler goes back to the smugglers and tries to become better friends and sees a lady with a weird vest and the bad guys say "everyone is always picturing her naked, they don't stop to think about whether she's smuggling turtle eggs", which proves how ingenious (aka evil) they are.
   | SO the bad guys keep feeling out Stabler as a fake customs agent and they want him to help smuggle a VERY RARE GIBBON, and he does but they get suspicious and shoot him, but he's okay and they set up a sting at the airport where the gibbon is being brought into the country via a basketball, and they catch the bad guys in the act of selling it to an asian guy and the bad guys say "gentleman, there are now only SIXTEEN of these gibbons left in the wild, hahaha."
   | But then the cops arrive and everyone runs over rooftops and almost falls down, except it turns out one of the two bad guys was an undercover cop all along and the other smuggler is JUST THE TIP OF THE ANIMAL SMUGGLING ICEBERG!
   | whew
   | so that's how it ended

Yes, the MPAA may hunt you down (like so many gibbons) if you `illegally download the episode <http://isohunt.com/torrent_details/53395617/svu?tab=summary>`__. But are you really prepared to depend on NBC's rerun-scheduling caprice when it comes to something so obviously awesome?
