It's now safe to say: I'm sick. This is no surprise, of course — it happens to me every winter, and with enough severity that I'm told I'm commonly described as "sickly". But I had high hopes for this year! I've started taking vitamin D, The Supernutrient They Don't Want You To Know About (except via features in Reader's Digest). I'm adopting an optimistic interpretation of the vitamin's powers and assuming that without it my body would presently be undergoing incineration at the hands of concerned NIH workers in contamination suits.

I take some comfort in knowing that this bug has also laid waste to everyone else I know. Considering that my immune system is capable of amplifying the pathogens contained in a kitten's single adorable sneeze into a maelstrom of phlegm and whining worthy of an unusually tedious episode of *House*, this is an improvement. At least I know my body's surrendering to a worthy microbe.
