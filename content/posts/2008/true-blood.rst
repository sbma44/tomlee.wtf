I'll be up front with you: it's nothing but exposition, the art is so-so, the display software is terrible and it ends with an irritating cliffhanger. Still! If `the Sunday NYT article <http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/03/arts/television/03rhod.html?_r=1&scp=1&sq=true%20blood&st=cse&oref=slogin>`__ wasn't enough for you, go read `HBO's True Blood comic <http://www.hbo.com/trueblood/comicreader/>`__. If nothing else it serves to quickly establish the ground rules for the upcoming series' world. Vampires, people! God, it takes so little to get me excited.
