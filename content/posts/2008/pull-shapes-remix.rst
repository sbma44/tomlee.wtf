I've been meaning to link to this but kept forgetting: `RAC <http://theremixcompany.co.uk/>`__ has a `characteristically catchy remix of "Pull Shapes" <http://popscenesf.imeem.com/music/cyyQ4tcd/the_pipettes_pull_shapes_rac_mix/>`__ that's worth a listen. I know, I know — why touch a song that's already so great? Well, they wisely don't do too much to it. But it's at least a somewhat novel take on a well-worn track, and may be marginally more dance-friendly by virtue of having fewer slow parts (although clearly I'm not really qualified to judge).

Unfortunately the song doesn't seem to be available anywhere except `iMeem <http://popscenesf.imeem.com/music/cyyQ4tcd/the_pipettes_pull_shapes_rac_mix/>`__ (I tried to buy it! Honest!). I can vouch for `this software <http://www.freemusiczilla.com/>`__, should you want to grab the mp3 from their streaming-only clutches.
