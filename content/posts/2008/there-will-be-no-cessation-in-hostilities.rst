Some of you may have noticed that I updated my Facebook profile this morning in various ways, including the addition of an embarrassingly MySpacey profile photo (dig that soulful staring into space). Please note! I'm still not using that damn platform. I was mostly just trying to figure out how to put a note on my profile stating that I don't really use FB, and that folks should try contacting me elsewhere. Yes, I could just delete my account. But without a Facebook account many people cease to realize you exist, making detainment in secret government prisons all but certain.

Anyway, back to my attempts to add a note to my profile: they ended in abject failure. Which brings me to my suggestion: can somebody build a "I don't really use Facebook" Facebook application? Something that would display itself prominently on my profile page and respond to any messages by politely inviting the sender to email me instead?

I'm not trying to be a jerk, I promise. I have more or less made my peace with FB; I just don't have the time or inclination to start using it seriously, and I'm getting sick of sending notes to new online acquaintances politely explaining that it's not them, it's me.
