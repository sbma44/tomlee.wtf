For a moment, anyway. Beginning two Saturdays ago it was the beach in North Carolina; then it was Jeff and Marie's wedding in California; today it's Emily's birthday(!) in DC; tomorrow it's back to California for work; Friday it's the City Veins' CD release party at Iota; Saturday it's a belated birthday dinner with Emily in Philadelphia, hosted by our friends Tara and John Carlos.

In short, I am probably going to die. But then, I always knew that, and for a while now have been halfway-suspecting the Chinatown bus would be responsible in one way or another.
