`Adrienne gets personal email from strangers <http://dredgereport.wordpress.com/2008/10/13/return-to-sender/>`__. So do I — with a name as nondescript as mine, it's inevitable.

I love getting those emails, though. In particular, I've become a frequent recipient of pickup-basketball-scheduling emails among a group of devout young Asian teens & twentysomethings. It was all pretty boring until I started getting updates about their star-crossed mission trip to Kyrgyzstan. Plane delays! Lost luggage! The constant, unshakable faith that God cared deeply about their travel arrangements, and had a good reason for abruptly altering them. It was quite a rollercoaster ride, but everything ultimately worked out: they got their luggage and Kyrgyzstan is, presumably, now a Christian nation.
