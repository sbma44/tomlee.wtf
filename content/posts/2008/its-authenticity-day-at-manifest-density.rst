`Spencer's right <http://attackerman.firedoglake.com/2008/08/19/personalitycrisesandcrabchips/>`__: I shouldn't get myself tangled up in questions of potato chip birthrights. Perhaps my intemperate comments were motivated by jealousy. After all, it's not like you can buy Utz Chili Half Smoke Chips. The Crab Chip belongs to Baltimore; maybe I only think I don't want it because I know it can never truly be mine.

But the point of `that post <http://www.manifestdensity.net/2008/08/14/we_will_not_speak_of_the_ketch/>`__ stands! On Friday night, thanks to Ficke and Becks' generous snack-procurement, I had some Crab Chips back to back with Carolina Style BBQ Chips. I may have underestimated the Crab Chip, but Carolina BBQ remains the superior snack food.
