Say... does anyone have a spare cord that looks like this?

|Wiring for smoke machine control|

It's called an IEC plug, and it's the same type of connector that goes into most desktop PCs. The only trick here is that this is a male connector, not the incredibly-easy-to-find female version. It's simple enough to order one, but I'd feel stupid paying $7 shipping on an item that costs $1.50.

If you've got one lying around, perhaps connected to some ancient piece of unused equipment, let me know. Yes, I will be destroying it. But I can undestroy it afterward! And it's for a good cause: I need to force a smoke machine with an intermittent controller switch to stay in the on position — a noble calling for a humble cord if ever there was one.
