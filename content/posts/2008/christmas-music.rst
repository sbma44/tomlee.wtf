Prompted by `Stanley <http://www.unfogged.com/archives/week_2008_12_21.html#009485>`__, it's suddenly occurred to me that this is the last day that many of you will spend at your desks, staring at your computer screens. That means it's also the last good opportunity to capture your attention with Christmas MP3s. I haven't got anything original to offer, but it never hurts to re-share some personal favorites:

   | `The Pogues – Fairytale of New York </2008/12/23/christmas_music/The%20Pogues%20-%20Fairytale%20of%20New%20York.mp3>`__
   | `Frightened Rabbit – It's Christmas So We'll Stop </2008/12/23/christmas_music/Frightened%20Rabbit%20-%20It's%20Christmas%20So%20We'll%20Stop.mp3>`__

I suppose I'm willing to admit debate regarding the Frightened Rabbit song — I'm a big fan of it, and typically find myself listening to it for months after the holiday season. I even like the `all-choral b-side version <http://www.amazon.com/Christmas-Well-Stop-Choir-Version/dp/B000ZN0KKW/ref=sr_f2_2?ie=UTF8&s=dmusic&qid=1230048972&sr=102-2>`__, and have gone so far as to buy the new 2008 version from iTunes (which, thanks to some ludicrous overproduction, isn't nearly good as the version linked here). But it's a newcomer, and so I'm willing to accept dissenting opinions.

The same can't be said for "Fairytale of New York", which is pretty clearly the greatest Christmas pop song of all time. Temporary waivers allowing dissenting opinions may be granted for "So This Is Christmas", I suppose, but only if you're feeling too depressed and dissolute to listen to the Pogues — which, unless you're presently stumbling through the trash-strewn streets, cold, alone and wearing a Santa beard caked with sick, you're probably not.

Also, hey, here's `last year's equivalent post </2007/12/20/hey-have-some-christmas-music/>`__, which includes that Christmas Dismemberment Plan song.
