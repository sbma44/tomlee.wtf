I guess the `apparently <http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/ezraklein_archive?month=07&year=2008&base_name=meet_the_meats>`__ `counterintuitive <http://matthewyglesias.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/07/the_case_for_pork.php>`__ idea that pork is among the most efficient meats to produce doesn't strike me as all that strange. Obviously larger animals take more time to reach full size, wasting more energy on metabolic upkeep. But equally obviously there's a certain amount of overhead associated with being a mammal that may not scale constantly with the total amount of food that the animal provides. Consider the relationship between volume and surface area — same idea.

On the other hand, the pig is generally considered the smartest animal in the barnyard. So if you're looking for a reason to be uneasy about pork consumption, there you go: if you suspect that sentience works on a sliding scale, and if you believe that the moral outrageousness of a given act of violence against an animal is weighted by the animal's level of consciousness, then your pig-slaughter is far more ethically objectionable than ordering a serving of chicken tenders. This strikes me as a much better source of liberal guilt than the difference in carbon footprint between types of meat.

In other blog news: the New Yorker has made a `cartoon <http://www.americablog.com/2008/07/new-yorker-cover-shows-oval-office-with.html>`__ and it's not funny. People are... surprised? Anyway, Ezra has the `smart take <http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/ezraklein_archive?month=07&year=2008&base_name=that_new_yorker_cover>`__. For now I think we'll just have to cross our fingers that the New Yorker's much-vaunted influence upon the middle-American swing voter zeitgeist has been overstated.
