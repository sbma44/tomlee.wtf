Not a deep thought by any means, but jesus is it embarrassing the extent to which two cups of coffee act to alter my mood. I don't just mean providing pep and vigor; I mean lifting the veil from my eyes, restoring my hope for the future and engagement with the present, and generally making me into what I flatter myself to say is at least a semi-tolerable human being.

Whatever handicaps an adolescence spent playing Starfox and going to debate tournaments may have saddled me with, the experience at least shielded me from some dangerously cool compounds, and for that I should probably be grateful. I don't think I've got the neurochemistry to handle anything more exotic than what can be found in the break room.
