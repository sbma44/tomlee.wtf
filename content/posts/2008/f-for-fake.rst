Julian `posted <http://www.juliansanchez.com/2008/06/03/this-is-a-film-about/>`__ about *F for Fake* yesterday, which prompted me to watch a few more clips of the film scattered around the internet. I have to admit that I'm not familiar with much of Orson Welles' body of work beyond *Citizen Kane* and his famous *War of the Worlds* broadcast. So I had assumed that there was no more complete and cruel affirmation of Welles' final, nihilistic hopelessness than his next-to-last acting credit: `the voice of Unicron in the Transformers movie <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092106/>`__. But it appears that history has come up with innovative new sleights since then.

Within *F for Fake* there's a monologue about Chartes Cathedral in which Welles expresses the idea that our individual impermanence doesn't imply futility — that there's dignity to be had in the moment and within our collective history. It's quite beautiful.

Anyway, be sure to check out the `associated Youtube comments <http://www.youtube.com/comment_servlet?all_comments&v=pUrKCUTUSPo>`__, which together form a convincing rebuttal. I especially like the one comparing Welles' work (unfavorably) to that of Quentin Tarantino.
