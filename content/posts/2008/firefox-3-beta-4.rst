On OS X, at least, it's really nice! My only complaint so far: the address bar has gotten a little too smart for its own good, and introduces a noticeable lag when you hammer a URL or search query into it with sufficient ferocity. But `Firebug <http://www.getfirebug.com/>`__ (1.1 beta), the `Web Developer Toolbar <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/60>`__ and `Greasemonkey <http://www.greasespot.net/>`__ all seem to have already been updated for the new version, so I suppose I should be counting my blessings. As soon as `Tamper Data <http://jimbojw.com/wiki/index.php?title=Tamper_Data>`__ and `Live HTTP Headers <http://livehttpheaders.mozdev.org/>`__ get ported over I think I can safely delete version 2.

**UPDATE:** And, naturally, as soon as I try out beta 4, `beta 5 is released <http://tech.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=08/04/02/187252&from=rss>`__. Well, presumably it's nicer still.
