But not really! I've been vague about the scary story contest deadline from the start, saying it was today but not specifying a time. This was by design: obviously some of us might wind up scrambling to finish. I'm no exception, I'm afraid — Halloween party prep has begun in earnest, consuming a lot of the weekend. Although I'm almost done with my story, I'm not there quite yet.

If, on the other hand, you are a responsible person who can meet deadlines, then my hat is off to you. Go submit it! Just visit `halloween.manifestdensity.net <http://halloween.manifestdensity.net>`__ — it's a simple little drupal site I stood up on Saturday morning. I realize it probably seems like overkill, but this struck me as the best way to keep things anonymous. Just register for an account. You'll then be able to submit your story and to view and vote on other people's stories. Even if you're not writing anything, I'd still encourage you to head over there and `create an account <http://halloween.manifestdensity.net/user/register>`__ so that you can help rate stories. It should only take a second.

Those of you who are fighting the good fight and powering through your tales' conclusions: I'm grateful, and looking forward to reading your stuff. Let's shoot for the end of tomorrow night, okay? That means that ideally everyone who's planning to participate will have submitted some text by Wednesday morning.
