|image1|\ I can relate to Megan's instinct for early adoption, and I admire `her fortitude <http://meganmcardle.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/07/iphone_relief.php>`__. But the iPhone 2 experience is not for me. It's the price: I could be wrong, but my understanding is that, as a current iPhone owner who's already sold AT&T his soul, I'd be paying `$400 more <http://www.tuaw.com/2008/07/08/why-you-shouldnt-buy-the-iphone-3g-on-friday/>`__ than the advertised, subsidized price. That's too much for 3G and a GPS receiver that's apparently incapable of TomTom-style realtime tracking.

In fact, I'm not even upgrading to the iPhone 2 software — not yet, anyway. I'd love to have a blogging client and NetNewsWire (which would sync my unread items). But I'm not quite ready to abandon my jailbroken apps. `Twinkle <http://www.iphonehacks.com/2008/04/twitter-twinkle.html>`__'s a great Twitter client already — I don't need Twitterific. `Lexitron <http://justanotheriphoneblog.com/wordpress/2008/04/19/lexitron-new-text-twist-like-game-for-iphone/>`__ is a fantastic game, and certainly more appealing to me than Monkey Ball. Besides, as any geek will tell you it just feels good to know that there's a command line interface on your phone.

I'm sure I'll crack eventually, but for now I'm holding out. Who knows, I `might <http://blog.iphone-dev.org/post/41886107/the-quest-for-the-holy-ggg>`__ `not <http://blog.iphone-dev.org/post/41730121/living-in-sweet-harmony>`__ have to choose between the App Store and Installer at all.
