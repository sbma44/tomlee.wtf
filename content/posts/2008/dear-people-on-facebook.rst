Please don't take it personally when I don't respond to your friend request. I never really used the site, but for a while I would at least accept incoming friend requests. Then, with a number of unattended-to requests already piled up, I got a request from someone who I decidedly did not want to be friends with. At that point I decided not to bother with it any more.

So you won't be getting friended, which is no big deal since I don't do anything on the damn site. Please rest assured that I think you're lovely, and that the odds of you being the person who drove me entirely off Facebook are quite low — though non-zero! It's in my best interest to keep you guessing, working hard to earn my fondness. If nothing else I figure this calculated withholding of affection is good practice for one day being a parent.
