Now that comments are working, let me ask a question. Part of Irresponsible Holiday Spending Spree '07 was the purchase, by Charles and myself, of an HDTV. It's backordered from Fry's at the moment, but I'm assured by many Amazon commenters that it'll be great. When Sunday school classes ponder the question "Could God make a TV so big that He couldn't watch it?", this is the set they use to illustrate the point (Answer: "We can never know. But lo! Surely He would have delivered unto us these three HDMI inputs, for He is just and good.").

So we've got a lot of new pixels, or will have them in short order. We don't have enough signal to keep them occupied, though. So it's time to say goodbye to our beloved DirecTivo. But should we consider DirecTV's hi-def package, or go talk to Comcast? Is one hopelessly inferior to the other, or is it worth taking the time to shake each down with the trademark mixture of cajoling and threats (think "abusive husband from Law & Order") that I use in all my interactions with customer service representatives? Help me internet, you're my only hope.
