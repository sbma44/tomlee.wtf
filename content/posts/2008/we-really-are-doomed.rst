`Alex Balk <http://radaronline.com/exclusives/2008/09/john-mccain-lies.php>`__:

   Why does John McCain tell so many lies? Because lying works! If you didn't read `that AP analysis we mentioned earlier <http://radaronline.com/exclusives/2008/09/the-fbi-infiltrates-american-organizations.php>`__, you really should. It makes the very instructive point that even if the press actually does its job and shows that the lies John McCain and his surrogates tell are, real, honest-to-God lies, it doesn't make a difference. Noting how the media had debunked many strands in the giant web of lies the McCain team has put out over the last two weeks, the article goes on to admit that it doesn't really matter:

      Major news outlets have written such fact-checking articles for years. "But in the last two election cycles, the very notion that the facts matter seems to be under assault," said Michael X. Delli Carpini, an authority on political ads at the University of Pennsylvania's Annenberg School for Communication. "Candidates and their consultants seem to have learned that as long as you don't back down from your charges or claims, they will stick in the minds of voters regardless of their accuracy or at a minimum, what the truth is will remain murky, a matter of opinion rather than fact."

Now, real-life evidence. Check out this comment, from a `Wired post <http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2008/09/the-many-faces.html>`__ about the various Palin spoofs — it's whole point is to catalog parodies, and it's quite explicit about this!

   | Hi,
   | just a question:
   | http://sarahpalin.typepad.com/
   | is this real??? I read and read and have a very hard time struggling with the idea that she is really this dumb that she can write this.
   | Come on, War with Russia, Creationism, Anti-Abortion, but admitting to ban and steal books from the libraryfor those reasons? that's not at all a sane woman. Please answer: how are u sure it's her blog??
   | Thanx

I have read a lot of comments like this over the past few weeks. And while they're sort of funny, they're also deeply depressing. I suppose that says as much about my sense of humor as it does about the electorate. But one of those things results in awkward moments at parties, while the other will ultimately lead to the death of thousands, if not millions, if not the destruction of the entire planet.

Doomed, I say!
