Pretty totally sweet. City Veins, are you paying attention? You can skip to 0:52 if you're strapped for time.

I remember one assembly in middle school that featured something similar. For reasons still unknown to me an administrator had us all come to the auditorium and then said, basically, "Children, this gentleman has built a laser harp. Please listen respectfully, and DO NOT GET INTO HIS VAN."

Then the laser harp guy bounded out and said "Hi kids! I built this laser harp! If you think about it, that proves that you can do *anything you set your mind to*. But only if you stay off drugs! Now, who wants to hear a bad MIDI sample of an electric guitar?"

Ah, laser harp guy. You poor bastard.

**UNRELATEDLY:** Am I the only one who's found every single thing he's heard about the Newseum so far to be completely grotesque? But then, I suppose I've been down on the project ever since they scrapped the initial plans to build it high enough to reach into heaven.

(Yesterday, when all the network anchors interviewed Petraeus there, like high priests conducting sacred rites at their newly opened temple? Pretty bad.)
