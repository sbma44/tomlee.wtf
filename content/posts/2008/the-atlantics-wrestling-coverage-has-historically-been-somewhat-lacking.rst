Any smart marks will get a kick out of `this Ta-Nehisi Coates comment thread <http://ta-nehisicoates.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/10/to_be_the_man.php>`__. It makes me wonder why I don't watch wrestling anymore — but only briefly, then I quickly remember that the industry's in a fallow period, lacking in talent and filled with junk. A more persistent puzzlement: why haven't I spent more time geeking out over, say, The Rockers with Spencer? Between the grittiness, emotion and highbrow disdain, pro wrestling seems suited to his unique style of connoisseurship in a number of ways.
