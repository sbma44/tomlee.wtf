Tim's reaction to `Rasmus Fleischer's essay <http://www.manifestdensity.net/2008/06/10/fleischer_on_copyright/>`__ is `now online <http://www.cato-unbound.org/2008/06/11/tim-lee/two-paths-for-copyright-law/>`__, and definitely worth a read. I think it's more interesting than the original, in fact, primarily because the aspects of how copyright will work that Tim proposes and discusses seem less inevitable to me than the ones Fleischer covered.

But I need some time to think about it (and to finish the workday) before writing anything in response, so for now you'd better just `go read it <http://www.cato-unbound.org/2008/06/11/tim-lee/two-paths-for-copyright-law/>`__.
