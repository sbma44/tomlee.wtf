From `Megan <http://meganmcardle.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/01/ive_had_a_slightly_horrified.php>`__, this is a pretty good line:

   I abhor fake meat. If you really want anonymous grade-z vegetable matter pulverized into tiny pieces, assaulted with various chemicals, and then processed into something that at leas superficially resembles a chicken muscle, I suggest you have the processing done by a chicken.
