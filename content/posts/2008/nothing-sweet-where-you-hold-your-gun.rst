| Well, `the gun ban is over <http://dcist.com/2008/06/26/us_supreme_court.php>`__. Unlike a lot of my friends, I'm not particularly enthusiastic about this. Guns are amazing tools, fun to use recreationally and capable of instilling such an awesome sense of power that I don't think people are very good at rationally considering the questions surrounding them. Certainly that's been my experience whenever I shoot one — for about six hours immediately thereafter gun ownership seems like a really, really great idea. Woo guns!

I think Yglesias is (sort of) right when `he says <http://matthewyglesias.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/06/activism_i_can_believe_in.php>`__:

   From a policy perspective, what DC [was] trying to accomplish is just futile -- as long as the District is a very small patch of land adjacent to Virginia, there's no way gun regulations of this sort will prevent criminals from acquiring weapons.

This is true, but probably misses the utility of a handgun ban from a police perspective. The ban was an enforcement tool: find some probable cause, search a suspect and if you find a gun they're an automatic criminal. Handy!

Of course, the MPD used to employ the "`no unlicensed bikes <https://secure.washingtoncitypaper.com/cgi-bin/Archive/abridged2.bat?path=q:\DocRoot/2005/050902/dl_cycle&search=&&SearchString=&AuthorLastName=&IssueDate=06%2F17&SelectYear=2005&next.x=67&next.y=12>`__" law toward approximately the same ends, which I thought was stupid and unjust. So maybe I'm a hypocrite. On the other hand, suspects with bikes are probably less nefarious, on average, than suspects with guns (recent comment threads notwithstanding).

At any rate, I think Matt is right to imply that this decision will have little effect on the level of gun violence in the city. And the Fenty administration says it's ready to respond, presumably with laws about triggerlocks and a draconian concealed carry permitting process. If the upshot is that DC residents can keep ready-to-use guns in their homes but not their cars or persons, I'll be happy enough, I suppose.

Oh! But let me reiterate `Charles' <http://thecityveins.com/blog>`__ previously-stated rule: no guns in our apartment, please. This includes parties! The `knife fights <http://flickr.com/photos/cappseus/2163169014/>`__ are quite enough already, thanks.

**UPDATE:** Hmm. That excerpt of the decision quoted at DCist sure makes it sound like the court is calling triggerlock requirements unconstitutional. But hey, I'm no lawyer, and I don't recall the specifics of DC's triggerlock law. Hopefully there's some middle ground to be found, like requiring their use in any household with children.

**UPDATE 2:** `Ryan==smart <http://www.ryanavent.com/blog/?p=1187>`__. I agree completely, with the previously-expressed caveat to his second point.
