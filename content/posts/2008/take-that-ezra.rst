This (via `Ezra <http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/ezraklein_archive?month=08&year=2008&base_name=what_gender_are_you>`__) is a `pretty fun little toy <http://www.mikeonads.com/2008/07/13/using-your-browser-url-history-estimate-gender/>`__ — it uses `this clever hack <http://www.niallkennedy.com/blog/2008/02/browser-history-sniff.html>`__ to figure out what sites you've recently visited, then compares it to demographic data from Quantcast to determine whether you're male or female. My results:

That's right: my overpowering masculinity extends far; yea, even unto the document object model.

Actually, though, I think I probably got this result in a nontypical way, as my browser history currently contains no links to ESPN. The most incriminating domains on my list include `jeroenwijering.com <http://jeroenwijering.com>`__, `digikey.com <http://digikey.com>`__ and, um, `washingtontimes.com <http://washingtontimes.com>`__ (I don't read it for the articles! I swear!).

That, or maybe the script noticed that yesterday I read `an article about Tucker Max <http://radaronline.com/exclusives/2008/08/tucker-max-responds.php>`__. Based on that datum alone the script should not only be able to tell that I'm male but also that I'm an asshole.
