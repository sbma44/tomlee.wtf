- Kriston `makes his triumphant return <http://grammarpolice.net/>`__. Woo! Just in time to make up for the lack of Yglesias, too, who turns out to have been responsible for about 40% of all the material on the internet's daily output.
- Jeff has `returned to the east coast <http://www.jeffnye.org/adventures/2008/08/jersey.php>`__, where the weather — and lifestyle — is appropriately unpleasant, by god. Marie's arrival is... imminent? Simultaneous? A secret? Time will tell.
- Angela's `CP cover story <http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/display.php?id=35974>`__ is a great read. Confronting the faceless jerks behind this city's dysfunction is a noble endeavor, and one that the City Paper has been doing in `pretty entertaining ways <http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/blogs/citydesk/2008/06/24/confronting-frank-winstead/>`__ lately.
