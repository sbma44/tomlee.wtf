One hundred and seventy dollars, ninety minutes, six fillings, four syringes of anesthetic and three tubes of filling compound later, the right side of my mouth is decay-free. I get to do it all again soon enough, but first I have a blessed three-week reprieve. Now I just have to wait for the right side of my face to wake back up.
