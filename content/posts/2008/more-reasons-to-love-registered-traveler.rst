Y'know, the program that lets you `skip </2008/06/04/new-and-better-ways-to-make-air-travel-worse/>`__ through `lines </2008/07/29/not-only-elitist-and-shameless-racist-too/>`__ at airports? Well, the database of registered travelers' personal information has `just been stolen <http://yro.slashdot.org/yro/08/08/05/1539231.shtml>`__. And no, of course it wasn't encrypted. What, you think a company empowered to decide who bypasses airport screening should know something about security? Sheesh.
