You've already seen this, but for the record: `Brian has emerged victorious <http://www.mediabistro.com/fishbowlDC/hottest_media_types/hottest_media_types_your_2008_winners_91436.asp>`__, as he inevitably must in a world that still clings to some shred of sanity — or, at the least, aspires to dignity.

Impressively, over 221,000 votes were cast for Brian. That's one out of every four District residents, and about a hundred thousand more than were cast in the city during `the 2006 election <http://elections.gmu.edu/Voter_Turnout_2006.htm>`__! Truly, this represents a mandate. A mandate to continue being hot.

**ALSO:** An impressive showing by runner-up Jeff Young. One to watch for 2009! I think this kid's got a big upside.
