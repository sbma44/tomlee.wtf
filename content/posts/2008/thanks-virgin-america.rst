Booking a flight on Virgin America: I'm about to confirm and pay. Would I like to join their loyalty program, which doesn't yet exist but which someday may provide some meager membership benefits before the airline inevitably goes bankrupt or is absorbed by a larger carrier? Sure, why not.

I'll tell you why not: because as soon as I'm done I'll be told that my previously locked-in reservation has expired, that making the same one will now cost 33% more, and I'll get a busy signal when I call their 800 number to complain. Go to hell, Branson.
