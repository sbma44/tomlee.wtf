I twittered about it yesterday, but allow me to repeat myself through yet another automatically-distributed form of correspondence: `this Animal Keyboard song <http://www.swedesplease.net/?p=1025>`__ is great.

   `Animal Keyboard – Good vs. Bad <http://www.archive.org/download/AnimalKeyboard-GoodVs.Bad_862/AnimalKeyboard-GoodVsBad.mp3>`__

More at `his Myspace page <http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&friendid=86872423>`__. Sure, this is `far <http://www.angelfire.com/stars/twink/music.html>`__ `from <http://hypem.com/search/pram/1/>`__ the first act to use the toy instrument gimmick. But the palette of noises on offer from this *particular* toy is distinctly more NES-ish than most, which fires up my brain's nostalgia receptors something fierce and generally makes for some of the more pleasant 8-bit music I've heard. It makes me want to run outside and start collecting coins.

Unrelatedly, I'm also currently a little fixated on the song at the end of `this Stereogum post <http://stereogum.com/archives/video/new-frightened-rabbit-video-head-rolls-off_008206.html>`__.

   `Frightened Rabbit – The Modern Leper <http://stereogum.com/mp3/Frightened%20Rabbit%20-%20The%20Modern%20Leper.mp3>`__

You might remember me `getting excited </2007/12/20/hey-have-some-christmas-music/>`__ about this band's Christmas music offerings. Now I'm just excited about them in general (or at least about their upcoming album, from which this song is taken — the stuff I've heard from their last release isn't blowing me away). Scottish accents and melodrama are a winning combination.
