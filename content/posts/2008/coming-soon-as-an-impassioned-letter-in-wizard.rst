Important business:

#. `Via Matt S. <http://mstem.wordpress.com>`__: `Leonardo DiCaprio as Captain America <http://blog.wired.com/underwire/2008/06/captain-ameri-1.html>`__!? No no no. *That's the wrong kind of earnest.* He looks wrong, is a pretty atrocious actor and has never pulled off a convincingly alpha-male leading role.
#. `Hulk is about the Cold War <http://thinkprogress.org/attackerman/2008/06/14/hulksomewhatdisappointedbutwillstillsmash/#more-1344>`__? I have to defer to Spencer's greater familiarity with the franchise, but this seems all wrong to me. The Hulk is afraid of himself and his lack of self-control. He's defined by rage, isolation and the hopelessness of ever achieving normality. He's a teenage boy, in other words, Peter Parker but with a worse temper and gloomier attitude. Hulk is for anyone who's felt like the anger welling up inside of them could destroy the world, and been unsure if they liked the idea.
   I mean, yes, radiation, etc. But that was just the unknowable technology of the day.
