I apologize; I'm totally fascinated by this Ashley Todd business. I can't stop.

The latest development appears to be her claim that she was in some sort of psychogenic fugue state when she scratched the B in her face:

Unfortunately I am unable to speculate as to the veracity of such a claim; the `DSM-IV doesn't say anything one way or the other <http://www.psychiatryonline.com/content.aspx?aID=9744>`__ about sufferers' tendency to send out Twitters containing pre-fugue exposition.
