There are a number of stupid jokes that I'd like to make but which I am not quite willing to `spend $40 on <https://www.godaddy.com/gdshop/tlds/me.asp?ci=12646>`__:

- `http://youcantsee.me </static/2008/07/17/johncena-20080717-163443.jpg>`__
- `http://mynameismyna.me </static/2008/07/17/marlo-20080717-162805.jpg>`__
- `http://theinternetisgettingincreasinglyla.me <http://techcrunch.com>`__

Anybody take the plunge? For a moment I thought my idea to buy http://jetai.me was brilliant, but of course it's already taken.
