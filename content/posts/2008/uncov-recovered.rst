`The only tech blog that matters <http://uncov.com>`__ shut down early this year, and after the traditional "does the blogger really mean it?" period I deleted the entry from my RSS reader.

But now, having just executed a botched subscription merge courtesy of the NetNewsWire iPhone app, Uncov has reappeared among my feeds. And, much to my surprise, it's got new entries! It looks like Ted started posting again in April. Persai, the project that he was working on, has recently launched as `PressFlip <http://pressflip.com>`__, and consequently the content is more about the new venture and Java programming than about eviscerating idiotic startups — for now, anyway. Give it time. If you're feeling impatient, go read `Ted's Register column about Protocol Buffers <http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/07/14/dziuba_google_protocol_buffer/>`__ for some of that old flavor.

Curiously, `uncov.com <http://uncov.com>`__ redirects to `pressflip.com <http://pressflip.com>`__. So the return of Uncov is... secret? Who knows, cares, or can be bothered to figure out the answer? The important thing is that the `RSS feed is working <http://feeds.feedburner.com/uncov>`__, so you should go resubscribe to that.
