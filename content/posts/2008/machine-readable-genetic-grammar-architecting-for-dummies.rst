I'm not at all confident about which of his aliases I should be using, but I *am* quite sure that son1's series of posts explaining the location of his work — right at the intersection of genetics and computer science — is pretty fascinating. I'm jealous, frankly: taking a problem and unraveling it into tasks that can be algorithmically accomplished is incredibly satisfying; I can only imagine how interesting it must be when the problem is something as complex and challenging as studying genes.

So go! Read! `part 1 <http://bayes.wordpress.com/2008/05/13/seeing-the-logic-of-classical-genetics-part-i/>`__, `part 2 <http://bayes.wordpress.com/2008/05/13/northern-lights-2/>`__, `part 2a <http://bayes.wordpress.com/2008/05/14/apparently-one-idea-was-all-i-ever-had/>`__, `part 3 <http://bayes.wordpress.com/2008/05/15/its-getting-hot-adhere/>`__ and `part 4 <http://bayes.wordpress.com/2008/05/15/its-not-one-of-my-tricks-its-my-conclusion/>`__.
