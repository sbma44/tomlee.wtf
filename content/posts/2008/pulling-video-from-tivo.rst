Not bad, right? And that's resized and compressed to a lossy jpeg. Take my word for it: the original looks fantastic.

It turns out that `tivodecode <http://tivodecode.sourceforge.net/>`__ is near-miraculous (the GUIs for it... less so). If you've got a recent-model Tivo you can visit its https interface, download the stored .tivo files and convert them to mpeg, easy as you please. Of course, the files are pretty big — several gigs for HD recordings — and I haven't currently got a machine on my network beefy and idle enough to transcode up iphone-ready files on a regular basis.

Still: pretty neat. It's nice to know that I've got a very high quality capture box sitting under my TV if I ever decide I badly need to put some televised video online. And it's just *fun*. Do any progressive media watchdogs want to pay me to help them create automated, annotated archives of cable news? Because with this gadgetry we could totally do it on the cheap.
