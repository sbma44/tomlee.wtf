I've been thinking of something like `this <http://jnhasty.com/embrace/>`__ for `a while now </2007/06/15/beat-me-to-it/>`__. And I'd still like to build it — but maybe not one this big. A Hall Effect sensor, cellphone vibration unit and glove should just about do it, I think (although given my general ineptitude I'll have to integrate a microcontroller, I imagine). The main holdup is an unwillingness to commit to buying the parts — I'm not sure what kind of Hall sensor I need, and they turn out not to be as inexpensive as I'd thought.

Besides, I've got another project slowly coming together. But perhaps I'll bug the Dorkbot guys for advice once I'm done with that. In the meantime, it's great to see more of these things actually being built.
