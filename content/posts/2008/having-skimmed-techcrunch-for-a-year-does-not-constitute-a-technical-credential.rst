One of the least appealing conventions of our internet culture is the whitepaper. The idea that the addition of a .pdf extension somehow adds authority to the ramblings of every self-described "SEO expert\*" and "social media evangelist" is an idea that's as pernicious as it is ridiculous.

For an especially blatant example of this you have only to go read the new `whitepaper on bandwidth caps over at GigaOM <http://gigaom.com/2008/09/30/gigaom-white-paper-the-facts-fiction-of-bandwidth-caps/>`__. Or, better yet, `go read my response to it over at TechDirt <http://techdirt.com/articles/20081001/0923422428.shtml>`__. I didn't get into any of the economic arguments contained in the paper — that's not exactly my area of expertise — but I have a sneaking suspicion that lines like "it is impossible to determine a product's unit cost before determining its price, since unit costs change with volume" are complete nonsense.

I haven't had time to write at TD for a while, but this piece of crap was sufficiently infuriating that I couldn't help myself. Even if you're bored silly by the topic of bandwidth rationing, Wikipedia plagiarism is always good for a laugh.

\* Seriously, anyone whose business cards feature the letters S-E-O in sequence ought to be thrown into a fucking volcano. With the exception of people from Korea, I guess.
