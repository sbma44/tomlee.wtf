Yglesias links to `Entertainment Weekly's chat with Zack Snyder <http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20213273_3,00.html>`__, director of the upcoming *Watchmen* movie adaptation, and hatches a `promising new conspiracy theory <http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/archives/2008/08/who_watches_the_movie_studios.php>`__. I haven't got much to add, but I do want to point out `this Q&A between Snyder and Wizard Magazine <http://www.wizarduniverse.com/080808snyder.html>`__. I understand the reservations about Snyder — and I share them, to some extent — but he's certainly saying all the right things.
