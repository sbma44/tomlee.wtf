I thought `this weekend's article on trolls <http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/03/magazine/03trolls-t.html?ei=5124&en=b5085d50ee5c65e5&ex=1375329600&partner=permalink&exprod=permalink&pagewanted=all>`__ was pretty good, and that the author did a nice job balancing the need to treat his subjects respectfully against his obligation to point out that they're completely full of shit.

The `associated Unfogged thread <http://www.unfogged.com/archives/week_2008_07_27.html#009080>`__ descended unfortunately quickly into an elucidation of who wasn't paying attention when their English class discussed *Crime and Punishment*. But prior to that everyone at least acknowledged that the activities described in the article aren't really what most people think of when they say "trolling". I think that's right for a couple of reasons.

For one thing, I suspect that trolling as it's understood in the blogosphere is probably a lot less prevalent than people tend to think. Deliberate bad-faith argumentation is much rarer than people who just strongly disagree or are otherwise unable to engage with the conversation in a way that others find interesting. Communities have a right to avoid having the same discussions over and over, and occasionally saying "don't feed the trolls" is one of the few ways to accomplish that, I guess. But it always strikes me as unfortunately dishonest.

Of course even if the prevalence of blog trolls is overstated, the existence of griefers can't be in doubt. Just log in to a game on Xbox Live and wait to be paired with someone who spends all his time shooting teammates in the back of the head. I think that's a better, less ambiguous description of what Fortuny and Weev and the rest of the people mentioned in the article really are. The only thing that sets them apart from a MMORPG PKer is their technical sophistication and their decision to ply their trade on the web.

What I found most interesting, though, was the ease with which these damaged individuals are able to damage others. Although I think Weev's Malthusian spiel is grandiose bullshit, I have my own similarly gloomy predictions. Specifically, I worry about the inevitable increase of personal power. Modern societies are fundamentally reliant on growth, and technology is no exception. But of course there are certain biological, physical and mental limits that will remain fairly static even as our ability to process information, wield energy and manipulate living systems expands. That means that over time every individual will be able to exert more power over others. Those potential victims will be similarly empowered to defend themselves, of course, but the advantage of surprise and the gulf in power between the average citizen and the expert will continue to grow.

I usually think of this in terms of weapons: we're already at the point where a disturbed and dedicated hobbyist is able to create a device or organism that can kill a lot of people. The difficulty of this task will continue to decrease and the associated potential devastation will continue to increase. The article on trolls made me realize that this effect will hold for psychological harm inflicted by a stranger just as well as it does for physical harm. And it made me feel much gloomier about our prospects for collectively ceasing to do damage for its own sake before the stakes get catastrophically high.

**UPDATE:** Go see what `Megan has to say <http://meganmcardle.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/08/culture_matters_1.php>`__, too:

   I doubt that the solution is, as the author suggests, just to learn to live with it. Rather, I'd expect that countertrolls will emerge--hackers who put as much energy into harassing these people as they put into harassing us. Evolutionary biologists call people like that "altruistic punishers", and they serve an invaluable purpose in any society.

I think she's probably right. I mentioned player killers above — I didn't mention `player killer killers <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player_killer#Player_killer_killing>`__: in-game vigilantes targeting PKers that have emerged enough times and places to be recognized as a phenomenon in its own right.

Whether or not PKKers have ever had much of an effect on any of the online communities in which they operate, though, I couldn't say. `Jason <http://www.doombot.com>`__?
