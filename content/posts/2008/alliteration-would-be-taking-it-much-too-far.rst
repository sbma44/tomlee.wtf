|never trust a leader with a mustache|

So `Dunkin' Donuts is building LEED-certified buildings <http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/archives/2008/10/leedn_donuts.php>`__, huh? With earthworm composting for the waste material? Fascinating. As a longtime veteran of the Donut Wars (Immobile Assault Division), my first instinct is to add this to the tally and see how Dunkin' — the hated foe of me and my fellow partisans — now stacks up against my beloved Krispy Kreme.

Here's the updated pro-Dunkin' list, which I present in the spirit of temperate objectivity:

- Ubiquity
- Distinctly uncoffeelike coffee (that is still strangely compelling)
- Has now broken with the donut industry's rapaciously anti-environmental past, apparently

I may be missing a few points. But what is not on this list — what is *never* on the list — is "excellent donuts". It's a bit mystifying to me, even after speaking to `Matt <http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org>`__ and `Michael <http://silbatron.com>`__ about it at length. Dunkin' Donuts seems to be this store that Northeasterners like to get coffee from in the morning. It happens to have the word "donut" in its name, and yeah, if you ask for a donut they probably have some in the back.

But — with the exception of the cake donut perverts, who frankly should be rounded up and hospitalized — I've never heard anyone defend Dunkin's donuts on the merits. Stacking the franchise up against Krispy Kreme is therefore bizarre, like saying McDonald's is better than a steakhouse because the latter doesn't keep a plastic slide out front. If you want to make a comparison based on the crucial "has a fun slide" metric, it should be between McDonald's and, say, a waterpark. Or, to bring the analogy home, between Dunkin' Donuts and a real coffeeshop. Instead the Dunkin' bullies choose to pick on poor Krispy Kreme (too busy making excellent donuts to defend itself!), rather than take on the coffeeshops that would surely spell their rhetorical doom.

| But I won't belabor the point. By now I can see that I'm on the wrong side of history (it's something of a family tradition). But those of us who truly love our donuts will keep the faith, and wait patiently for the day when Real Americans are ready to emerge from behind the silence of the glaze curtain and cry *Hot Donuts... NOW!*
