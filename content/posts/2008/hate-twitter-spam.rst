Well, probably not. The spam problem on Twitter isn't really that much of a problem, thanks to the clever way that following works. Still, it's kind of creepy to have a robot start observing your tweets in order to calculate god-knows-what. I'm `not the only person <http://twitterblacklist.com/>`__ who wants to keep their updates public, yet doesn't like going through and blocking newly-added lurkers.

So I built a little email processing script to handle the problem. Won't you help me test it out? If you're game, head to http://twitter.manifestdensity.net.
