I've been `pretty excited <http://www.zunta.org/blog/archives/2005/01/13/not_to_put_too/>`__ about `this record <http://www.amazon.com/Hello-Radio-Songs-Might-Giants/dp/B000FQVYF4/sr=8-1/qid=1160534460/ref=pd_bbs_1/002-0432362-5412058?ie=UTF8>`__ for a pretty long time. An album of covers of They Might Be Giants songs? With The Wrens handling "Birdhouse In Your Soul"? That's something that both present- and 14-year-old-me would stand in line for (which would be fun in its own right: I'd have so much comic- and videogame-based wisdom to impart...).

Then the project got delayed. And then The Wrens weren't covering BIYS anymore. And then I sort of lost track of it. But the album insisted on being released anyway, emerging into the world in what would be a truly horrifying analogy if only I could think of how to come up with a metaphor for amniotic fluid that's "Pitchforky".

Well, the CD is out as of July, but other than `this PopMatters review <http://www.popmatters.com/pm/music/reviews/various-artists-hello-radio-the-songs-of-they-might-be-giants/>`__ it doesn't seem to have attracted much attention. So, for the discriminating and/or cheap TMBG semi-completist, let me present some track-by-track impressions. An album of covers is a particularly good candidate for `an ala carte approach <http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?id=160469951&s=143441>`__ — especially since some of these tracks are particularly bad.

**1. Self - Ana Ng**
   What a miserable start. I hate to speak ill of the dead, but somebody clearly missed the point of this song in a profound way. "Ana Ng" is one of the most perfectly sad pop songs that I know. It's not a time for James Blunt vocals, precious production and intermittent assaults by fuzzed-out guitars. Boo.
**2. The Long Winters - Pet Name**
   Much better. This song lies somewhere between Son Volt, Clem Snide and Ben Folds, landing in a pleasant alt-pop sort of space. The hooks are tinkered with just enough. You should probably buy it.
**3. David Miller - Narrow Your Eyes**
   I should really recuse myself: this song contains handclaps. Put a few of those and/or some falsetto into a track and I'm pretty much guaranteed to like it. My opinion is worthless, enthusiastic though it may be.
**4. Charles Douglas - She's An Angel**
   I'm not a huge fan of the original track. If you are, but wish it sounded like an increasingly-unconvincing Pavement cover, this might be right up your alley.
**5. Frank Black - Road Movie To Berlin**
   Black Francis takes what I find to be a pretty godawful song and turns it into a totally-serviceable mumbly barroom dirge. It's the sort of essentially boring thing that white guys listen to in the last few years before they give up on rock and start obsessing over the blues. To be honest, I don't mind it at all. But then, I *do* have a birthday coming up.
**6. The Wrens - They'll Need A Crane**
   Here's where it gets tricky. This is the band I got this album to hear. And while it's no "Birdhouse In Your Soul", "They'll Need A Crane" is still a great song: superficially silly but with an underlying poignancy. And the band makes an ambitious choice from the start, moving the song's transformative centerpiece bridge to the very beginning of the song.
   But then they don't follow through. Don't get me wrong — they give is a thorough Wrensification (or, more accurately, a complete *Meadowlands*\ ing). But it feels like they didn't want to waste too many good ideas on somebody else's song. Or maybe they only had a four-track recorder lying around. I donno. It's good, but it's not the revelation I was unreasonably hoping for.
**7. Steve Burns - Dead**
   When you get down to it, the original version of this song doesn't have much going for it other than its weird and charmingly bouncy cadence. It turns out that slowing everything down, then throwing in harps and some half-hearted glitch-pop feints is a bad idea.
**8. OK GO - Letterbox**
   It's pretty funny hearing a band this `treadmill-centric <http://youtube.com/watch?v=NINJQ5LRh-0>`__ try to sound so sinister. It's a total reimagining of the song, I'll give them that. But competing for cleverness points in a TMBG-themed milieu seems a little pointless.
**9. Recepter - Boat Of Car**
   Good lord. Horribly lo-fi vocals combined with IDM noodling. It sounds like Thom Yorke is trapped under a stack of newspapers in his mother's garage.
**10. This Radiant Boy - Don't Let's Start**
   Take a can't-miss pop song and add brattier `Fred Schneiderish <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Schneider>`__ vocals and, yeah, it still won't miss. It's a shame that everyone sounds so bored, though. Those are the most listless guitars I've heard in a while. And, for the record, the breakdown is supposed to go "deputy dog dog a ding dang depadepa / deputy dog dog a ding dang depadepa D". Thank you for your attention.
**11. Jason Trachtenburg - Doctor Worm**
   You know those godawful neo-folk singers who infest the northeast? C'mon, you know who I mean: artists like Ellis Paul and Eddie From Ohio. The people who always sound like they're strummin' and singin' through a patronizin' grin while leaning over a newborn's crib? Well, that's what this sounds like. I don't know a lot about Jason Trachtenburg, but I'm guessing he's attained the level of fame he has through the gimmick that he and his wife have got going with their kid. `Good luck with that <http://www.firedoglake.com/2006/10/03/nrsc-uses-small-children-as-human-shields/>`__.
**12. Fluid Ounces - It's Not My Birthday**
   Meh.
**13. Brett Kull - Another First Kiss**
   I'm torn. On the one hand, this sounds like the Adult Contemporary mix of whatever it started out as. But it's pretty inoffensive, and I'm not familiar with the original recording. So I guess it comes down to the fact that this artist's name reminds me of the movie `Krull <http://www.badmovies.org/movies/krull/>`__, which was totally awesome. Therefore: recommended.
**14. Hotel Lights - The End Of The Tour**
   It's nice to end of a positive note. The original track was a lovely song that has the misfortunate of being recorded right as TMBG became a real band instead of just two dudes with synthesizers and an occasional kidnapped violin or horn player. It still turned out pretty well, but this version proves that it could've been better. Hotel Lights leave the basic structure of the song intact but swap new instruments in and out of the arrangement, then play through it with subtlety and grace. It's certainly not a reinvention of the song, but it's probably the best track on the album.
