| Werewolves are the only movie monster that I've ever found really terrifying, as I mentioned in `this <http://www.unfogged.com/archives/week_2006_11_12.html#005780>`__ unfogged thread. The loss of self and merciless, unstoppable ferocity that underpin the werewolf mythology have always added up to a particularly terrifying sum in my mind — and exposure to a memorable X-Files episode at an impressionable age didn't help matters. Besides, they have none of the saving graces of the other classic monsters: they don't possess any of the vampire's sexy villainy; they only shamble when particularly full, making them harder to escape from than mummies or zombies; and unlike the relatively rare creature from the black lagoon, blob or giant Japanese reptile, werewolves are completely ubiquitous (COMPLETELY. Look out your window right now — you should see at least two.).
| I mention all of this because the United Kingdom is `clearly <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082010/>`__ `ground zero <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werewolves_of_London>`__ for lycanthropes. This point was underscored by Emily forcing me to begin watching `Dog Soldiers <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0280609/>`__ the day before my departure. It's a movie which — based on the admittedly limited part I've seen so far — seems to be about werewolves viciously disemboweling English infantrymen in the woods of their homeland. That's my understanding, anyway; Emily assures me that it gets much scarier after the point at which we stopped, which, given the inconceivability of further werewolf-terror escalation, makes me think that maybe it'll turn out to be an existential meditation on the banality of existence or something.
| Anyway, to lay your fears to rest: day two of this London trip has now drawn to a close, and I have yet to be eviscerated, bitten, or even attacked by a mysteriously large dog that quickly disappeared into the brush. Going into this trip I was *sure* that at some point Michael would turn to me and say he'd forgotten the adapter for the projector, and would I mind running back to the hotel to fetch it? It shouldn't take me long, it's just across that foggy moonlit moor.
| But so far we've managed to remember all of our technical gear. And if I'm under any supernatural curses, the folks from Gre/enpe/ace have at least been nice enough to utter them quietly.
