Just got back from seeing John Hodgman, David Rees and Jonathan Coulton at the Warehouse Theater with `Sommer <http://cruelsommer.blogspot.com>`__, `Matt <http://ficke.blogspot.com>`__, `Catherine <http://outtamindouttasite.typepad.com>`__, `Julian <http://juliansanchez.com/notes/>`__, `Will <http://willwilkinson.net/flybottle/>`__ and probably several other hyperlinked Americans.

My headphones `broke <http://www.etymotic.com/ephp/er6.aspx>`__, my ipod clip busted, my work email's been flaking out and my DSL modem spontaneously changed its settings after two years of quiet competence. If you don't hear from me, check under the supposedly fail-safe garage door.
