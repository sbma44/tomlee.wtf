John Hodgman and his dizzying psychedelic forest have come and gone, but the F.W. Thomas Performances continue on: tonight's the `sixth installment <http://fwthomas.blogspot.com/2006/11/post-hodgman-edition.html>`__. I won't be able to make it — I'm headed to Charlottesville for my mom's birthday — but you should go. Unless you're a member of my immediate family, of course, in which case: see you tonight.
