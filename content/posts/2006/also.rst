| `Sommer is the best person ever <http://cruelsommer.blogspot.com/2006/12/i-am-teh-hero.html>`__. I was hoping to sit on the news, taking my time to calmly and objectively evaluate how this triumph affects Sommer's place in history. I hate to be forced to make a decision prematurely, but right now I'd say she's coming in somewhere between the saints who died of puncture wounds and the ones whose deaths were related to being cooked and/or eaten. But it's hard to say — wherever she ends up, thanks, Sommer!
| Now, the question: what games to get? I'm leaning toward Rayman & Zelda, for the sake of mini-games and single player obsession, respectively. But I could be talked out of it if anyone has a particularly strong case to make on behalf of Excite Truck (or anything else).
