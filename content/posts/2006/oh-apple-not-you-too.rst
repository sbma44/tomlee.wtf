I suppose that this verbal use of "gift" isn't technically incorrect — that's what the internet tells me, anyway. But it still seems really, really ugly to me. I've given up on the rest of the American-speaking world, but I expect more from my turtleneck-wearing yuppie compatriots in Cupertino. They really ought to task some more people with editing. So to speak.

Other things! The Wii: pretty great, although potentially bad for my joints. Emily: currently stuck in Philadelphia. Myself: off to make half-hearted efforts at physical fitness. More on all of these later.
