| Wanted: one or preferably two cassette tape decks or walkmen that the lender doesn't mind getting back in the form of a pile of parts (or a thankful email). The second one (if available) needs to work and have the ability to record. The first doesn't need to work at all.
| Alright, you've got the parameters for the riddle. Now, what could I be up to? How does this scenario end with a dead man in a puddle of water in a locked room? How many legs have I got at various times of the day? And whose son am I? Etc.
| I'm serious about the request, though.
| **ALSO:** `This <http://www.justriddlesandmore.com/>`__ is an unintentionally great name for a site.
