| Stop it, you `pretentious <http://www.google.com/search?q=%22hallowe%27en%22%20site%3Aboingboing.net>`__ `twits <http://www.makezine.com/blog/archive/2006/10/thrills_and_chi.html?CMP=OTC-0D6B48984890>`__. It's HALLOWEEN. Halloween. Not "Hallowe'en". You are not living in the Victorian era. You are not a medieval alchemist recording observations about phlogiston and aether. You are (hopefully) not Tori Amos.
| So cut it out. We've already got a perfectly fine convention for representing that word. It doesn't need to be gussied up with superfluous apostrophes. Besides, there's a decent chance that you'll mix up the words "entomology" and "etymology" when you try to justify this outrageous behavior. Don't risk embarrassing yourself further.
| And hey, while you're at it, see what you can do about the following:

- Use of the word "whilst" by non-British people
- Employment of the phrase "ceteris paribus" for any purpose other than getting a philosophy TA into bed
- Incorrectly utilizing the word "viola" as a synonym for "presto". Unless, of course, the revelation it refers to has something to do with a small string instrument.

On behalf of the internet, I thank you for your prompt compliance.
