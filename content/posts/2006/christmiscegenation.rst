Just to clarify:

   | In the meadow we can build a snowman
   | Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
   | He'll say: Are you married?
   | we'll say: No man
   | But you can do the job
   | when you're in town

This *is* about fucking a (potentially magical) snowman, right? I may be missing something.
