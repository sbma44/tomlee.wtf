| Hi. Welcome to the new blog. See the header? It's all Flickr-powered and dynamic and other things. Also, there's a sidebar. Yeah. Great, I know.
| So, look: I'll get down to the business of bloggy fun just as soon as I can. But unfortunately `the old site <http://www.zunta.org/blog>`__ — and my relationship with Catherine — needs to be eulogized first. This is a terrible way to start, I know.
| But most of you know me through that site, which I shared with her. We were together for nearly six years — the only significant relationship in my life that preceded it involved discussions of who would pay for the prom limo. Catherine probably knows me better than anyone, and I'd like to think I can say the same. I have a lot of affection and respect for her, and I think I always will.
| Things ended badly. Our last year together, conducted mostly at a distance, was, to my mind, pretty awful for a pretty large proportion of its duration. She's upset right now, and not without justification. But I'm a little upset, too, that she started a new blog — the contents of which are a secret hidden from an audience that appears to consist solely of me — and used it to tell our shared friends that I'm an asshole.
| Do I deserve that judgment? Well, some of it, yes. When I say it ended badly, I mean it both in terms of feelings and execution. But I hope that those of you who used to believe me to be a decent guy will listen when I say that our six years together didn't end with a sudden, overnight metamorphosis on my part. There's plenty of backstory, complication, bad feeling and mitigating circumstance that is as yet unspoken. If you really want to hear about it, `you only have to ask <mailto:tom%20(at)%20manifestdensity.net?subject=so%20what's%20the%20story>`__. I honestly won't begrudge the electronic voyeurism. Suffice it to say that I sleep soundly at night, yet still count myself among the ranks of the non-sociopathic.
| I'm honestly not very pleased to be writing this. But I don't feel as though I have much say in the matter. I can't really face the idea of ubiquitous silent (but polite!) censure, so here I am. We lived out a lot of our relationship on the internet, so I suppose I shouldn't be surprised to find part of its end here, too.
| Like I said, bloggy fun will arrive soon. Magnetic fields and and mot justs aplenty, I promise. For now, just do me a favor and believe me when I say that I'm not all that bad.
