Some of you might've seen `my post on DCist <http://www.dcist.com/archives/2006/10/17/frightening_fil.php>`__ yesterday about Count Gore De Vol, DC's hometown horror host. I have to confess that I wasn't aware of his existence until recently. Now that I do I'm an instant fan.

`Local broadcasting <http://isohunt.com/torrents/?ihq=uhf>`__ sounds like a lot of fun — in one interview I read, Dick Dyszel, the man behind Count Gore, recounts the character's origins: the station needed a horror movie host, and he already had a lot of white pancake makeup on hand since he also helmed the channel's Bozo the Clown franchise. In addition to the makeup, he says he already had a cape lying around because "it was the seventies" (which I find mystifying and vaguely scandalous). Transylvanian accents are cheaper than either of those things, therefore: vampire.

But not only was I ignorant of the Count's existence, I didn't even realize that horror hosts were a national phenomenon. Of course I knew about `Elvira <http://www.elvira.com>`__, Mistress of the Dark. But it turns out that her only real innovation was having enormous breasts. There are `horror hosts <http://www.horrorhosts.com/>`__ all over the country, presiding over plywood coffins and quietly helming late-night showings of abysmally bad scary movies. Some are `charming <http://www.creaturescape.com/HHH/sonofghoul/sonofghoul.htm>`__, some are `kind of sad <http://www.geocities.com/horrorhostunderground/html/hosts/119.htm>`__ (yet apparently popular), and others look like they might be `legitimately spooky <http://www.creaturescape.com/HHH/themortician/themortician.htm>`__ (check out the guy's `sample video <http://themortician.web.aplus.net/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderfiles/sitebreak.mpg>`__).

Even though he's no longer on the air, it's nice to know that Count Gore is ours — particularly since he seems to be among the most venerable and lighthearted of the horror hosts. And `his webpage <http://countgore.com/Dungeon.htm>`__ contains regular columns from a bunch of hosts from other parts of the country, which implies to me that there's a real sense of community among these guys. I like to imagine them all getting together for barbeques.

Anyway, I find it all pretty heartwarming. I'm still not ready to subscribe to Fangoria, though.
