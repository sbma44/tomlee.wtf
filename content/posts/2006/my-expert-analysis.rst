Russia and the U.S. have `plenty <http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/11/28/russia-agrees-to-us-request-to-shut-down-allofmp3com/>`__ of common ground. Should Iran have the bomb? Well, it's hard to say. But should consumers have cheap mp3s? That's a much easier question to answer.
| (Okay — clearly consumers shouldn't actually have *these* mp3s. Still, it's a little disappointing to see AllOfMP3 being shut down. Countries being jerks to one another is one of the best avenues we have left for preserving the freewheeling exchange of online information that we all like so much.)
