| Cyrus has `a post linking to several articles profiling Borat's unwitting interview subjects <http://cyrusfarivar.com/blog/?p=1164>`__. I remember a bunch of these profiles coming out when Ali G got his big DVD-release PR push. Fake production companies, friendly assistants — just insist on meeting the on-air talent before the camera rolls and I think you can escape Mr. Baron-Cohen's traps.
| But, as you might imagine, the people who were duped aren't entirely happy. To their credit, few seem really outraged. But there is a recurring theme. From `Newsweek <http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15175836/site/newsweek/>`__:

   "I was disappointed that Mr. Cohen never let me in on the joke," says Kathie Martin, who runs an etiquette school in Birmingham, Ala.

From the `BBC <http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6071486.stm>`__:

   | Washington DC public speaking coach Pat Haggerty also appears — and is seen trying to teach humour to Borat...
   | "About halfway through the session we took a break and I went up to one of the producers and said: 'This guy can't be real.
   | "'If you let me in on the gag, I will help you reach your goals because I don't care if you're from Kazakhstan, nobody is this crazy.'"

From `Linda Stein's firsthand account <http://www.downtownexpress.com/de_179/howiwasduped.html>`__:

   Inspired segments of Borat and me were cut. At one point, Borat declared that men are stronger than women and held up two chairs to prove it. I did, too — although Iâ€™m only half his size

| Last night, immediately before the Q&A, John Hodgman forbade any questions that were wacky or funny. It didn't stop the middle-aged, slightly drunk government lawyers in the audience from defying their embarrassed wives' pleas and asking questions like, "What is the meaning of life?" But he was still right to try.
| What those interview subjects and assistant-counsels-in-charge-of-something-or-other don't understand is that guys like Hodgman and Baron-Cohen aren't looking for assistants. It would be nice if they were running a humorist fantasy camp where everyone could feel like part of the action, the same way that many NBA stars spend a few weeks each summer pretending that they enjoy playing games of Horse with aging corporate executives. But that's not what your ticket or selection as a interviewee gets you. To Hodgman, you're a customer. To Baron-Cohen, you're a prop. Just try to turn in a performance half as subtle and unselfconscious as that horse that falls down in the preview.
| Which brings me to the other thing about Borat: the exculpatory analyses of him are wishful thinking. Don't get me wrong — I think the character is hilarious, and by far the funniest of Baron-Cohen's creations. But the liberal-guilt-inspired line about Borat's humor being an attempt to lay our own prejudices bare? It's complete bullshit. Yes, "`In My Country There Is Problem <http://onegoodmove.org/1gm/1gmarchive/2004/08/in_my_country_t_1.html>`__" showcases some entertainingly brazen country/western antisemitism. But most of Borat's interviews just show that Americans are patient, generous hosts. That isn't particularly funny.
| It's Borat himself that's funny, because he's a hilarious oaf. He looks foolish. He does dumb things. It's fun to laugh at him. But of course, this kind of humor has been employed in `awful ways <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minstrel_show>`__ in the past.
| Now, the guilt-dodging excuse I favor is that Borat isn't actually parodying any specific ethnic or cultural group. He's a hodgepodge of stereotypes we have about eastern European otherness. He's certainly not a specific attempt to belittle the people of Kazakhstan (their `sadly defensive PR campaign <http://www.avclub.com/content/node/53470>`__ notwithstanding) — the only reason Borat hails from a specific country or speaks snippets of pidgin Polish is that he needs to interact with the outside world. These details convey some necessary authenticity; but they aren't meant to tie the character to any specific group of human beings. I don't really believe that Borat's antics are any more detestable than when Homer Simpson visited Crazy Vaclav's Place Of Cars (or blamed Tibor for his problems at work).
| But I may be fooling myself. I'd feel pretty uncomfortable watching a Borat segment with somebody from Kazakhstan, and that may be the real test. I won't be at all surprised if history judges the character harshly. I'm still going to see the movie, though. Because I'm a monster.
