| The Governess seems `disappointed in herself <http://pygmalioninablanket.blogspot.com/2006/10/lame.html>`__ for bailing out on the line for the `super-secret Beck show <http://www.dcist.com/archives/2006/10/30/becks_surprise.php>`__. I wouldn't be so hard on yourself, G.
| Call me crazy, wrongheaded, dangerously deranged but... isn't Beck sort of just-okay? Sure, he's put out a lot of pretty good pop songs. But I can't say that any of them have moved me or gotten stuck in my head (at least, not in a good way). My favorite thing that he's done remains, by far, the `Futurama episode that he appeared in <http://www.progressiveboink.com/justin/Futurama/beck1.jpg>`__. I wouldn't mind seeing one of his shows, but I don't think I'd go through very much discomfort for one. Besides, the Black Cat back stage sucks. And he's a `Scientologist <http://www.xenu.net>`__. Fuck 'im.
| But I could be wrong. I'm no Beckologist — all I know is that *Sea Change* bored the hell out of me. Maybe I'm completely missing the point. Still, I've already got an `experimental indie pop weirdo/messiah <http://www.cmsaunders.free-online.co.uk/music/pics/flips/01.jpg>`__, thanks. But I guess I'll keep Beck's resume on file in case a position opens up.
