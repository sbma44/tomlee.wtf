| |the founder of LNS. seriously.|\ I somehow missed it on Monday, but this week's `Late Night Shots roundup <http://www.wonkette.com/politics/last-week%27s-shots/last-weeks-shots-ridiculous-generalizations-will-suffice-212755.php>`__ is just as good as I would've expected. Callow, mean and dumb: these are the worst people on earth that aren't eligible for trial at the Hague.
| I'm a little worried, though — Rusty's resolve `seems to be faltering <http://whyihatedc.blogspot.com/2006/10/late-night-shots-party-crash.html>`__. Be strong, comrade! And realize that these people were probably expecting you, and almost *certainly* said nasty things about you after you left. The devil will be pleasing in his appearance (the picture to the right notwithstanding).
| Anyway, I'm sure that the LNS crowd has a full Wonkette crisis response initiated. I've no doubt that they're superficially peeved, but secretly deeply, deeply satisfied. First: people paying attention! The board's denizens must be glamorous and interesting after all. Second: the obvious response is to hatch secret conspiracies. This incursion by the outside world represents a chance to set up new, more exclusive inner circles, in a flurry of private-messaging between the idiot children of the American aristocracy. It's an opportunity to purge the undesirables from the LNS boards — and you've gotta love a good purge. Let a thousand electronic Skull and Bones bloom!
