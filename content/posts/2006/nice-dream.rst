Once you publicly identify yourself as a geek, you start to hear a lot of ideas for internet projects from acquaintances. Anybody who's spent much time on the internet has at one time or another had an apparently monumentally great idea for a website that convinced them, for about half of an afternoon, that they were about to be rich. I'll refrain from reciting some of the more embarrassing ones I've heard, but they're frequently pretty bad.

There are three things working against you when you try to become a geek's idea man. First, the idea's probably terrible. No offense, it's just how these things go. Second, someone's almost certainly already done it, and folks generally don't bother doing any research before pitching it to a geek (who then has to figure out how to politely demur). Third, geeks have their own ideas for projects, and will usually find them more interesting and/or potentially profitable than third-party ones.

Hmm. This blog post is off to a strangely negative start. Well, nevermind all that. All I really wanted to say is that a while ago I had an idea to offer band-specific RSS feeds from Pollstar at a central site, letting folks track when their favorite bands were coming to town. I never got around to it, since it's not all that interesting an idea from a technical standpoint. But `look <http://earfeeder.com/>`__! Somebody went ahead and did me one better, adding news and reviews and presales to the feed. Doing me *two* better, they programmed a Java applet that scans your hard drive to identify the bands you want on your watchlist.

Sadly, the Java thingy didn't work very well for me. I keep my music on my ipod and a server backup rather than my laptop hard drive, and I had to click the "find more music" link after the first round of searching to get it to look through the mp3s there. And once it started, it stalled out after 60some songs.

Still, it's a pretty nice idea, and if you keep your music on your hard drive it might really come in handy.
