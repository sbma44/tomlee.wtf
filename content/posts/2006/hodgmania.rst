Wow. Thanks to `Matt <http://ficke.blogspot.com/2006/10/oh-sweet-sweetness.html>`__ for alerting me to the lineup of `the next F.W. Thomas <http://fwthomas.blogspot.com/2006/10/fifth-episode-hodgman-coulton-rees.html>`__. `Someone's <http://cruelsommer.blogspot.com>`__ been holding out on me (or perhaps she's just been too preoccupied with her campaign to spread bronchial disease throughout the city).

I have to say, though, that I was a little disappointed to read that the author of *Get Your War On* is rounding out the bill. Don't get me wrong — the strip's fine and all (if a bit over-praised). But when I read that the performers will be "Hodgman, Coulton and Rees", he's not the first or most potentially-hilarious contributor with a qualifying surname who `comes to mind <http://dceiver.blogspot.com/2005/11/ward-3-more-like-psycho-ward-jonathan.html>`__.
