| Here's something that might make my excitement over this Processing stuff a little more understandable: `salary versus performance <http://benfry.com/salaryper/>`__ over the course of the 2006 MLB season. Use the slider at the top to advance through the season. There are a huge number of ways that this project could be used to visualize interesting data.
