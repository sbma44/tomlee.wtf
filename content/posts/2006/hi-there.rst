Hello, internet people, and welcome to the new blog. I'm making a conscious effort not to bog myself down in introductions and ruminations and other pretensions aimed at making this kind of endeavor seem weightier than it actually is.

So! I'll just say that I really enjoyed writing `the old blog <http://www.zunta.org/blog>`__ with `Catherine <http://outtamindouttasite.typepad.com>`__. By the time it was done, I'd written 265,971 words' worth of ecstatic technology evangelism, prejudiced music elitism and feeble attempts at humor. Stand by for more of the same.

Also coming: a completed site. Archives? IE compatibility? Finished templates? I guess some people enjoy those sorts of things. I'll try to humor them by and by.
