There's a new Arcade Fire track! The sound quality isn't great, but the song is:

   `Arcade Fire –Intervention <http://youaintnopicasso.com.nyud.net:8090/mp3/Arcade%20Fire%20-%20Intervention.mp3>`__

It's perhaps not the most mind-blowing thing they've ever recorded. But I'm glad to hear it for two reasons. First, it isn't a radical departure from their last album (I want more!). And second, it makes me think about what it'll be like to once again see Winn Butler singing it like he's never meant anything more, while the strings swell and the percussionists go crazy. More `tour dates <http://pitchforkmedia.com/page/news/2006/12/11/Arcade_Fire_Announce_More_Shows#40130>`__, please.

The above link is to a `Coral Cache <http://www.coralcdn.org/>`__ URL — it should hopefully work a little more snappily (and long-lastingly) than the original source, which still seems to be getting hammered (or maybe it's just my connection). If your network blocks port 8090, head to `the source <http://www.youaintnopicasso.com/2006/12/15/arcade-fire-intervention/>`__.

Via `stereogum <http://www.stereogum.com>`__, who picked it up from a BBC show.
