Enough `bitching </2006/11/14/albums-i-cant-really-recommend/>`__. Here's an album I can genuinely recommend: the `Malajube CD <http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/39144/Malajube_TrompeLoeil>`__. It's far from perfect — the band lapses into M83/Muse-style ridiculousness on a fairly regular basis during the album's middle. But, as the Pitchfork review attests, they're a nice bookend to (or, more hopefully, just a recapitulation of) the era of Canadian indie rock dominance. This track (heavily influenced by my beloved `Unicorns <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Unicorns>`__) is one of the best songs I've heard all year:

   `Malajube – Montreal -40°C <http://www.malajube.com/mp3/malajube_montreal-40.mp3>`__
