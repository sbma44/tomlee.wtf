- Ed Castronova is the biggest name I know of when it comes to studying sociology in massively multiplayer online roleplaying games. Nevertheless, the MacArthur foundation `giving him $240,000 <http://news.com.com/2102-1043_3-6127294.html?tag=st.util.print>`__ to build an Shakespeare-themed online world strikes me as a really, really bad idea. First, it's probably not enough money to make anything anyone would want to play. Second, it's *really* not enough money to deliver a game produced by people who aren't game designers and are going to make lots of project planning mistakes along the way. Third, players may not be keen to play a game that's just as concerned with using them as guinea pigs as it is with entertaining them. Fourth:

     "If you collect the 'To be or not be' speech and then take it to a lore master or to a skilled bard, he can then apply the magic to your broad sword or you (could) utilize the magic in a battle situation to give you this massive (advantage)," Castronova explained. "So there (will be) this intensive competition to get the best speeches of Shakespeare in your play book."

  No there won't, because that idea is LAME.

- It might be tough to deciper `this comic <http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2006/10/20>`__, even with the `associated blog post <http://www.penny-arcade.com/2006/10/20>`__ if you're not a huge geek. Here's my shot at it: ads in games are nothing new, but it's only been in the last few years that they've become dynamic, able to be sold throughout the game's lifespan and downloaded to update players' machines. Now we face the prospect of that in-game advertising becoming more targeted, thanks to the game rifling through your hard drive, checking your browser history and work documents and musical taste. I would be extremely surprised if there was any law stopping this practice that game company lawyers couldn't get around with a creatively labyrinthine End User License Agreement. But maybe I'm just being pessimistic.
