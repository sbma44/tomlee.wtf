DCR/TV RSS:

- `host it </static/2006/10/11/dcrtv.php.txt>`__
- `consume it <http://feeds.feedburner.com/DCRTVByDaveHughes>`__

| I don't understand why people insist on being such non-RSS-using pains-in-the-ass.
| **UPDATE:** Feedburner! Why didn't I think of that before? Should be more reliable than the previously linked-to fly-by-night free PHP webhost, while remaining pleasantly not-hosted-here.
