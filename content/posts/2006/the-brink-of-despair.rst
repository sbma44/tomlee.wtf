I'm not sure what else I can do. I've been to the suburbs Sunday after Sunday — but there have been no Wiis. The last two days I've gotten up early and taken the Metro to Pentagon City before work, visiting the Best Buy within minutes of its opening — no Wiis. My [STRIKEOUT:agents] friends have generously scoured `Texas <http://urbancoyote.blogspot.com>`__, `Arizona <http://www.cruelsommer.blogspot.com>`__ and `London <http://www.movering.com>`__ on my behalf, like Nintendo Nazgul — no Wiis.

Tomorrow everyone will be off work, and it'll be too late. I may make the trek to Best Buy one more time, but I expect there'll be throngs waiting with me. My advantage will be gone, and my cause lost.

I suppose there's always the week after Christmas. But in the meantime I'm left seething at the thought of those who have successfully gotten their hands on the console. Have they proven their devotion? Did they deserve it more than me!? No, goddammit! I guess this is how conservatives feel about affirmative action.
