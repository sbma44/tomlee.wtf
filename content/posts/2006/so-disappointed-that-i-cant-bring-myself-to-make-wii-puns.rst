| `Charles <http://dccharles.blogspot.com>`__ and I have now made a total of 15 visits to stores in an attempt to buy a Wii, including a number of trips where we got to the Best Buy/Toys R Us/Circuit City before it opened. Yet we remain Wiiless.
| Charles has taken it hard, and seems to be considering going into seclusion. I remain optimistic, but in an increasingly *Grapes of Wrath*-ish sort of way. Will I take the clerks' advice and try again at the end of the week? I suppose I got to.
