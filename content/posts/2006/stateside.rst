| Well, I'm back home, or at least on the Dulles toll road. We landed almost an hour late, but the flight was mostly pleasant and uneventful. I **did** sit behind a human being with what may be the worst sense of taste I've ever encountered — and if you've ever heard one of my own full-throated defenses of the movie *Predator*, you know that's saying something.
| But picture, if you will, an individual watching a DVD set of the NBC series *Las Vegas* on her laptop. I mean, it's one thing if you're sitting at home on a Saturday night, desperate to have Nicki Cox distract you from the crushing weight of existence. But to see someone pay for the privilege of taking that experience with them anywhere... Well, it was troubling, at the least. Then, when I saw that the laptop was sitting next to a Lonely Planet guide to Florida, I knew that that pleasant-seeming lady was utterly doomed.
| (I know that I've got friends, family and maybe readers in Florida. But c'mon — you know what I'm talking about.)
| **ALSO:** can anyone explain to me why TSA insists on cell phones being turned off while you're in the line for customs or waiting for your bags afterward? I can believe there may be a good reason, but like most air travel regulations on cellphones, I have a feeling it's mostly just capricious, officious rulemaking. What could they be worried about, anyway? Someone cheating on their answers to the customs officials? "He's asking me whether I brought back any fruit... I need an answer, quick!"
