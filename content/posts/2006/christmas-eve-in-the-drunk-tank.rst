Christmas Eve at the Red Room: hugely disappointing.

|non-depressing redroom scene|

Does this look like a crushingly depressing Christmas Eve tableau? The sort of sight that Charles Bukowski might have seen before erupting in volcanic torrents of vomited eggnog? I submit to you that it is not. And that's a problem.

I suppose I had a good enough time hanging out with Matt and Spencer. But to be honest, we were all looking forward to a repeat of `last year <http://www.zunta.org/blog/archives/2006/01/02/personal_failur/>`__: a bar with few people, plenty of despair and "Fairytale Of New York" on a nonstop loop.

But instead there were no Pogues albums on the jukebox, there were lots of people, and I ended up having a pretty good time. Rats.
