I feel your pain, `Billy <http://www.unfogged.com/archives/week_2006_10_08.html#005580>`__. On Saturday I drove down 395 to visit my mom in Louisa (home of `alleged deer heads <http://www.charlottesvillenewsplex.tv/news/headlines/4250196.html>`__!). On the way there I saw two deeply confusing things.

First, a Calvin window decal on a truck. He wasn't urinating, though — he and Susie Derkins were kneeling in prayer before a towering cross. It looked a little like `this <http://www.webbsgraphics.com/decals/imagemagic.php?img=3dfKzcvYoeTbnZapx9Ho2uKboJufk9na2g%3D%3D&w=400&h=300&page=popup>`__, except for that sticker's lack of Susie (there are a lot of variations on this decal available on the web).

I guess the message is that there is a power and a love in this world even greater than that of Ford or Chevy. I know that it's hard to open your heart to such a possibility, but the angry piety written on the face of the woman driving the SUV in question told me that I ought to try. Or else.

ALSO: while trying to find that particular decal, I stumbled across `this page <http://www.stickergiant.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?ftbppp_sort=popularity&Screen=SRCH&Store_Code=sg&search=calvin>`__. I defy you to find a better window into the conservative zeitgeist.

Second, a roadside fruit stand/garden center on Rt. 3 had a 30'-tall silver figurine crucified on an enormous cross. It has "NASA" clumsily written on its thigh. It doesn't seem to exist on Flickr yet, and I missed it on my way home, but `this <http://flickr.com/photos/trevira/138205065/>`__ might give you some of the flavor. But think bigger, silverier, and more crucified. Somebody either really likes astronauts or really hates them. That, or they have a serious space-crow problem.
