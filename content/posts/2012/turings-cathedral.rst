Just wrapped it up, and `posted some thoughts to Goodreads <http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/478811027>`__ (I'm thinking of automating that process here -- let me know if any of this blog's few readers would find that irritating). The short version: it's a great history that's marred by a bunch of fairly silly futurist speculation. I'd be curious to hear if anyone else has read this thing.
