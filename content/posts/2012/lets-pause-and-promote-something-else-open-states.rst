Since I might have your renewed attention, briefly ("but I thought this RSS feed was broken"), and since I'm already frantically promoting it on Twitter, let me draw your attention to `this morning's announcement from Sunlight's Open States team <http://sunlightlabs.com/blog/2012/open-states-50/>`__.  In short: we've got a new mobile app, and our services now support all fifty states (plus DC and Puerto Rico).

Getting to fifty is a big deal, and I'm extremely proud of Sunlight and the Open States team for reaching this milestone.  No one's done this before; it took us years to do it ourselves. This data existed, but in a completely piecemeal manner -- there was no consistent location, API or data model. Getting it collected, cleaned and accessible will have real impacts for journalists, watchdogs and citizens.  If you saw `Sunlight's recent work on mandatory ultrasound legislation <http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/2012/virginia-ultrasound-law-image-few-others/>`__ -- well, suffice it to say that there's much more coming on that front, and Open States is what's going to make it possible.

This was a huge undertaking -- honestly, I don't think anyone knew if creating and maintaining a legislative data collection architecture pulling from so many disparate sources would even be possible when we started. It's a tremendous testament to the contributors and developers who've made this possible, and the leadership of my colleague James Turk in particular.  Nice job, you guys.
