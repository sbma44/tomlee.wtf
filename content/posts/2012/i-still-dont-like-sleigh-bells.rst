Kriston wants me to believe that Sleigh Bells is good. To wit, he shares this video:

So! They've dropped the irritating `audio clipping <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipping_(audio)>`__, which `I found physically unpleasant </2010/05/14/sleigh-bells/>`__. But this is just as gimmicky. Have a look at the waveform:

The Sleigh Bells audio has been compressed to hell and back. By way of comparison, here's the waveform captured from a Youtube of *Back In Black*, which we can hopefully agree is a not particularly sedate song (in order to be more than fair, I've tried to crop this to include both more time, and portions of the song that extend beyond the admittedly stuttery intro):

Overcompression is standard operating procedure for recorded music these days. But it's also a cheap trick that makes things seem louder. That's fine for grabbing attention, but in the case of Sleigh Bells it's the second time they've made a play at the same gimmick -- and this is a far less daring move than the audacious/unpleasant clipping of the last LP.

I think the way to understand this is by way of analogy to food. There are certain reliable levers that chefs can lean on to stimulate our pathetic simian brains. More salt/more fat/more sweetness/more umami. Any of these will endow food with a greater valence. That's not a good or a bad thing, necessarily; it can be deployed artfully by skilled gastronomists, or it can be hammered home via a bag of `Sweet Chili Doritos <http://www.fritolay.com/our-snacks/doritos-spicy-sweet-chili-chips.html>`__ that's been crammed full of sodium, MSG and corn syrup solids.

Loudness is just the same. The louder it is, the more fervent it is; the more raucous the party, the more urgent the emotion, the more outrageous the rebellion. And Sleigh Bells is indisputably making their name by being the loudest bad around.

So I leave it to you: is Sleigh Bells a Ferran Adrià, or are they a Frito Lay? Tedious pop historians will adjudicate this, but based on the simplistic lyrics, repetitive hooks and increasingly well-worn playbook, I know where I'm placing my bet.
