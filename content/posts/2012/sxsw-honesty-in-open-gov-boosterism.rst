@urbanfran and @fkh did a really nice job on their panel. For one thing, I love transit data. For another, it's good to acknowledge that projects that dream of large-scale user adoption/participation need to grapple with what people actually want to do. They don't want to come home, make dinner, and start researching potential wastefraudandabuse on recovery.gov, for instance.
