I'm at SXSW, and rather than tweeting about it incessantly, I think maybe I'll just post some things here.

I suspect that my mood will improve with the weather and after eating some tacos, but right now SXSW is a very alienating experience.  I was last at this conference in 2007, with a bunch of people from EchoDitto.  Emily and I had just started dating. Twitter launched here that year, and although I never thought it'd take off the way it has, it did immediately feel like something special -- maybe it would only ever be used by the kinds of people there in Austin, but for us it would be a new, enriching layer on top of reality. I was thrilled and amazed at what technology could mean and by this new, fascinating class of people who seemed to believe -- quite earnestly and intensely -- hunches about the future that I had secretly harbored but been half-embarrassed to express. I'd never known these people were real, but now I was really one of them and *everything* was going to come true.

That feels very far away right now.  The weather's worse, and there are way too many people -- they're everywhere, all the panels and shuttles and bars are bursting.  They're the same kinds of people, but by now everybody's settled on the same dream -- the mad-lib details vary, but the basic story is about startups and a kind of "innovation" that seems indistinguishable from a dreary march toward the combinatorial exhaustion of the current technological landscape's possibilities.

I'm older, and it's easier to see the contours of feasibility and to recognize how many of those dreams are unworkable or ill-advised or just mundane.  Websockets are a great technology, but they're going to change interfaces, not lives, you know?  Real-time data and self-quantification are interesting and will be useful in a few domains, but reality is not as procedural and deterministic as programmers' minds; most of these speculative possibilities will not pan out, even after we've built the dehumanizing foundations necessary to really put automated Taylorism through its paces and see what it can do.  There is a terrifying amount of talk about cognitive psychology results, and I'm starting to think that the actually-quite-limited predictive power of these models at an individual level is the only thing that can possibly save us from people like my twentysomething year-old self.

Well.  Like I said: tacos are indicated.  In a moment, off to the airport to pick up a rental car and escape the shuttles. Later: panels from activists, journalists and political folks, which I think will be both less inspiring and less frightening, both of which strike me as healthy things.
