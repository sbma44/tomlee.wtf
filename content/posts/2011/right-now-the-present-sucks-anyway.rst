I'll keep my ill-advised and emotional reactions to the horror in Arizona confined to Twitter for now (though I should say that I'm quite certain I have a unique and trenchant perspective on the matter, having had a brief and superficial conversation about gun control with a cab driver in Phoenix last month). Let's talk about something totally different!

I just stumbled across a video that explains my favorite experimental neuroscience result pretty well:

Libet's work isn't the conclusive case against free will that it might seem at first blush. Neural evidence of motor planning can occur without resulting action; such planning may not occur in the same way for different types of decisions; and you can come up with various free-will-as-last-minute-veto accounts that strike me as pretty lame but seem to make some people feel better. You don't *have* to accept conscious experience as an epiphenomenon. Still, I've always found the result a great means of attaining a mild but pervasive sense of existential worry, which I think is worthwhile on its own merits.

I was prompted (through a clear chain of causation!) to search for the video after reading `this <http://www.concatenation.org/futures/whatsexpected.pdf>`__ (PDF), via `Trivium <http://chneukirchen.org/trivium/2011-01-04>`__. It's short and worth a look. It descends into improbable and grandiose flourishes after the first column (people like me would keep a Predictor on their keychain and then get on with their lives). But with all the excitement over `Daryl Bem's paper <http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2010/11/feeling-the-future-is-precognition-possible/>`__ that's arisen during the last few months, I'm feeling pretty good about my odds of being able to buy a Predictor-like gadget from `DealExtreme <http://www.dealextreme.com/>`__ in the next decade or two.
