If you're in the market for project management software -- and it seems like a large portion of people working on the internet perpetually are -- let me encourage you to check out my cousin Sophia's startup, `Webplanner <http://webplanner.com/pages/index.php>`__. I am admittedly not the world's biggest Silverlight fan, but the software seems to do a nice job of actually having something to do with projects and how they are executed (as opposed to, say, Pivotal, which has always struck me as a more awful videogame than bug tracker), while not being quite as stripped-down-to-the-point-of-frustration as Basecamp. Worth a look.
