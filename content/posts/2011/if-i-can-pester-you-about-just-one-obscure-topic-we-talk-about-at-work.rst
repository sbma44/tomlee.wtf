Let it be `this one <http://sunlightfoundation.com/sixdegrees/>`__.

As is probably obvious, I think there are good reasons to be excited about information technology's capacity to improve governance. For the small stuff, it already has -- I can get a new recycling bin delivered just by visiting a website!

But for the really big stuff -- like keeping track of how we award multi-million dollar contracts, or how we regulate polluters, or how we track the political influence economy -- there are significant barriers to applying automated analysis. A lack of usable corporate identifiers is among the biggest of these problems. Citizens are expected to have trackable identifiers for their cars, and firearms, and selves. I have to surrender my SSN to a private entity just to see if I'm allowed to buy a new phone!

But for companies, the situation is quite different. Corporate registrations are held by states, which face bad incentives around making this data usable both because inaccessible registration information makes the state more attractive to registrants, and because states collect substantial sums for use of the data. Meanwhile, the federal government is wrapped in a nightmare tangle of purpose-built ID fiefdoms and one overarching public-private partnership that supplies identifier data that's both unacceptably restricted and of unacceptably poor quality.

Attempts to improve the situation will no doubt be met with much gnashing of virtual teeth: competitiveness! Privacy! Personhood! None of these hold much water, though: not only has relevant tax return information (which would go a long way toward solving this problem) been completely public at various times in our nation's history, but other countries impose a disclosure burden adequate to resolve the problem while still enjoying vibrant, competitive economies.

Anyway, my colleagues make this case more rigorously and persuasively both `at this microsite <http://sunlightfoundation.com/sixdegrees/>`__ and in `this blog post <http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2011/11/01/we-cant-have-corporate-accountability-until-we-have-corporate-identifiers/>`__ (about the overall problem) and `this one <http://sunlightlabs.com/blog/2011/physics-of-the-corporate-universe/>`__ (about the technical considerations behind our presentation). I hope you'll give it all a look.
