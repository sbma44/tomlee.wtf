|Omni Man|\ It came out pretty well, I think. The boots are `off-model <http://www.amazon.com/Invincible-Ultimate-Collection-Vol-1/dp/158240500X/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1320021787&sr=8-3>`__, but that was mostly because the paint on them needed some more time before I could put stuff on it. And parts are secured with magnets! Ah, magnets.

I won't bore everyone with an explanation of the character (I did quite enough of that last night) but if you like superhero comics and haven't read *Invincible*, you really should. It's sort of like a reboot of everything in the big two's universes, but without the inevitable backsliding.
