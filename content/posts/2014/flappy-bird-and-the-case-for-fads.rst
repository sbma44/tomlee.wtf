|flappy_space_small|\ In a tab not far from this one, a small bird orbits an 8-bit Earth on a ceaseless elliptical. I put him there, and feel a certain pride about it. `You should launch some birds, too <http://corpsmoderne.itch.io/flappy-space-program>`__, if only to remind yourself that physics is pretty weird.

Too much has been written about Flappy Bird, but I'm going to pile on anyway: it reminds me of a conversation I've had with `Kriston <http://twitter.com/kristoncapps>`__ (and more recently `John Bergmayer <http://bergmayer.info/>`__). Kriston was complaining about some not-that-great book that was sucking up a ton of public attention. These people could be reading the classics! he said. Or just last year's much-better crop of novels!

I agreed with him about the objective merits of whatever book it was, but I stuck up for fad-chasing. There's something great about having everyone settle on a single conversation for a week or two, applying all their capacity for inventive criticism, clever jokes and feedback loops of enthusiasm. Faced with exile on a desert island, I could assemble a media library that was very self-edifying. Faced with participation in culture, I'm happy enough to watch the new season of *House of Cards* even though `it's sort of garbage <http://www.nationaljournal.com/politics/the-hate-watchers-guide-to-house-of-cards-season-2-20140214>`__. I keep an eye on new album releases for the same reason, even as experience makes each band's influences and lack of invention clearer.

*Flappy Bird* is compelling for a number of reasons, foremost among them the narrative surrounding its author and the ineffable appeal of `a game with neurologically agreeable physics <http://www.gamespy.com/articles/112/1124913p1.html>`__. But I'm also really enjoying it as a cultural rallying point: the `aforementioned orbit game <http://corpsmoderne.itch.io/flappy-space-program>`__, the `MMO <http://flapmmo.com/>`__, the `essays <http://flappybirdthinkpieces.tumblr.com/>`__.

Admittedly, this is because, so far, the conversation is mostly among people who enjoy essays and indie games -- for me, this is a comfortably skintight demographic. One doesn't have to look far to find `other, grosser avian videogame phenomena <http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=sr_nr_n_25?rh=n%3A1036592%2Ck%3Aangry+birds&keywords=angry+birds&ie=UTF8&qid=1392393996&rnid=2941120011>`__.

But for now, and maybe for the rest of its run, it's something everyone can talk about.
