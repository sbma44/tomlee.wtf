It was the best school that I could afford, and I think it gave me a good education. But it was never a great fit for me. I met some people there that I really liked and many more that I didn't. I identified with `these kids <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1504300/>`__, not the ones in ties at football games. I seemed to be the only person thrilled that Stephen Malkmus had gone to UVA (including Mr. Malkmus).

When I read the Rolling Stone article, I believed it. I had known and disliked the callous frat culture. I had been disgusted by `the university judicial system's failure to grapple with the beating of Sandy Kory <http://www.cavalierdaily.com/article/2001/11/jury-awards-former-uva-student-damages/>`__, and was unsurprised to hear that it had failed Jackie, too. And I believe that sexual assault is an enormous problem on American college campuses. I didn't bother to finish reading the story, to be honest. It only took a few hundred words to bring me to despair, and I knew what the rest would say.

When critics raised doubts about the story, I believed them, too. I knew and was friends with people in frats -- the stoner and geek frats, but frats nonetheless. I even rushed one, briefly! At a school like UVA these connections to the Greek system are all but unavoidable, particularly if you are underage and keen on drinking. Although their culture was sexist and aesthetically distasteful, it never seemed violent to me. Individuals behaving despicably was and is all too believable. But a premeditated, group-level endorsement of predatory violence seemed unlikely, particularly given the frats' years of experience projecting the most upstanding image they could manage to help keep the party going.

And of course there were other problems, some of which will only make sense to alumni. `Gawker's dismissal of the timing of fraternity rush as a salient factor seems unwarranted <http://gawker.com/that-uva-frat-letter-denying-rape-is-bullshit-and-heres-1667421511>`__, for instance.

I was unsure what to think. Because of conflicting evidence and heuristics? Only superficially. In truth, it's because I have competing self-conceptions that can justify themselves in different ways depending on what we collectively decide this episode's moral will be. I am a supercilious iconoclast who disdained the frats, even as he let them buy him oceans of beer. And I am a UVA graduate who thinks but does not say the phrase "public ivy" and who doesn't want people to think of rape when he tells them where he went to school.

My thoughts are ambivalent but they are uniformly tainted by emotion and vanity. And although their reasons are different, I think this true for most people discussing this case, and everything else, on the internet.

How could it be otherwise? We don't have enough information to judge the truth. There are endless explanations and additions that could modulate every atom of the narrative, but no amount of reporting is likely to let us access them satisfactorily. Luckily, we don't care that much. Instead we will settle for asserting, by fiat, how the world must have worked in this instance, reasoning from first principles: we are good, and the people we dislike are bad, and reality, in the long run, must surely reflect this distinction.

I no longer believe that I have a right to hold an opinion about what it was or when it happened, but I am pretty sure that something very bad happened to Jackie and that she's suffering because of it, and because of this she deserves sympathy and help. I believe it's her right to go to advocates for support or to the police for justice, but I don't believe that the rest of us deserve to continue gawking at her horror -- particularly now that the conversation surrounding it has lost any plausible claim to preventing future violence.
