| Stories about gold rush towns are a weirdly masculine thing. Or they are to me, anyway. Even apart from the brutality that characterizes life at any sort of frontier, the cliche of the prospector recalls exaggerated psychic dimensions that seem strangely understandable: obsessiveness, hermeticism, lustfulness and drunkenness and despair. Little boys, caked in filth and sporting awesome beards. There aren't a ton of well-adjusted family men in gold towns.
| The Luminaries scratches this particular itch pretty well. Crosbie Wells is as likable and hopeless and grizzled a frontiersman as you could wish for. Alas, the story of his fortune (and its misfortunes) leaves a lot to be desired.
| Not for lack of thoroughness, mind you. This book is 800 pages long. And the number of transformations and pairs of hands that Crosbie Wells' original gold strike passes through is so vast as to make the proceedings resemble a farce, only without the jokes. Catton stretches things further out by employing an ill-advised structural device based on astrology that is arguably clever but doesn't serve the story particularly well.
| Those 800 pages suffer from some defects, too. Characters are introduced with brief sketches, but they still manage to blur together. The story's villains do achieve an air of menace, but they're never made as charismatic as they clearly could be. And the Maori and Chinese characters are cliches (Catton seems to think that acknowledging this by explicitly referring to the former a "noble savage" will absolve her, but it doesn't).
| More than anything else, there's the elephant in the room: Deadwood. You want sprawling gold rush fiction? That's what you're competing with. The Luminaries is set in New Zealand, but it's the same basic cast of prostitutes, officious businessmen, inflexible lawmen and villainous bandits--only with much less emotional depth.
| Maybe that's just me. I do love Deadwood.
