But this Alexis Madrigal review of Evgeny Morozov's newest makes me think I can't get by with the usual summary essays. This sounds particularly appealing:

   Morozov's ultimate goal is to destroy the ideology of technology, so that particular technologies can be used in specific situations without the baggage of other people's nonsense.

Madrigal is mostly laudatory the work, but does question whether solutionism really does represent a slippery slope to pervasive surveillance and cascading social consequences.

I wish I found his skepticism justified. Consider `what Euclid is doing <http://www.franken.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=2325>`__, or the process by which a lame off-color joke made while waiting for a panel to start turned into two people getting fired and a business being DOSed. Although Morozov's digital segregation example might seem far-fetched in light of our contemporary mores,  there are absolutely `firms <http://klout.com/home>`__ dedicated to facilitating unequal treatment of different people on the basis of a hazily-defined and largely unaccountable assessment of their desirability.

Madrigal goes on to argue about the specific value of the quantified self movement:

   Morozov argues forcefully against first self-quantification, then quantification, then the "numeric imagination," then measurement itself, and, finally, the objective fixity of facts. Do you see what happened there? We went from a debate about whether or not to wear a pedometer to a debate about whether numbers can adequately represent anything in the world. This movement happens with terrifying speed in Morozov's work

   [...]

   OK, but what's so wrong with using numbers anyway? *So they are imperfect, but they're better than nothing, one might argue,* and at best they are a complement to the narrative imagination, providing a valuable check on the biases of storytelling.

Emphasis mine.
