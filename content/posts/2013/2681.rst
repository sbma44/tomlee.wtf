| I'm sorry not to have given Clarke the chance he deserved before now. I had read `Rendezvous With Rama <https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/112537.Rendezvous_with_Rama>`__, which struck me as an impressive but tiresome way of proving the author's physics bona fides. And I knew enough about Arthur Clarke's entanglement with the engineers who created the information age to be intrigued. But I had written him off as an autistic hard sci-fi novelist savante (who happens to have invented the idea of satellites).
| That was wrong. Clarke disclaims his past fascination with the supernatural in this volume's introduction, but it makes all the difference. His mastery of our physical universe is on display, but this book is fundamentally about the limitations of that mastery. It's no accident that the paperback is blurbed by C.S. Lewis.
| Let's get the mechanical concerns out of the way first: Clarke effectively establishes a mysterious situation, then skillfully escalates things. The characters on hand never feel particularly well-drawn, but then this is science fiction. He at least makes an effort, so let's award some points for that.
| The book has a fair amount to say about post-scarcity economics and society, much of it consistent with the current state of the art on the topic (complicated though it is by the empirical facts of inequality and expanding work hours). Clarke also predicts an end to religion and nationalism that seems somewhat quaint but still defensible.
| There is mystery, but no real tension to this book--my sample is small, but I suspect this is a hallmark of Clarke's. The facts are laid bare, and it's up to us to grapple with them outside of the text. The novel's truly interesting aspects relate to its resolution and the implications that follow. Spoilers from here on...
