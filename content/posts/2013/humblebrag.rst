I need to add, though, that although I have worked on these issues first-hand and know a bit about them, my knowledge absolutely pales in comparison to that of my current and former colleagues Kaitlin Devine, Drew Vogel and Kevin Webb. They deserve credit for what I think is `the best, deepest and most sustained work on federal spending data quality <http://sunlightfoundation.com/clearspending>`__ that's been done by anybody. And none of us would know how to make that expertise relevant to the people who can fix these problems without Sunlight's helpful, friendly and frighteningly smart policy team.
