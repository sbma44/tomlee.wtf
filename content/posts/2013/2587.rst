| Fun--just what I wanted for the beach. This is the first Hiaasen I've read, and he's as advertised: funny, colorful, and a better writer than the seedy Floridian proceedings really demand. This felt like it went on a bit too long, though, and of course was fairly light & disposable. Got a feeling the novelty will fade when I pick up another one of his, but I certainly enjoyed this.
