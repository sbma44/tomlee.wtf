Ashkan tweeted that the new iPhone will have a Fitbit-style accelerometer, enabling (presumably) Fitbit-style applications:

   IPhone5S now has M7 (fitbit style) sensor so app makers can track user's activities -- i.e number of steps taken http://t.co/wIzIU5FRCv

Tell me if this is crazy:

| \* Software is a more competitive market than hardware.
| \* Standardizing accelerometer hardware (assuming Android device makers hop on board, too) will gut the market for devices like Nike Fuel, Fitbit, etc.
| \* There'll be much stronger demand from consumers for data portability across services/interfaces/apps.
| \* All of this means thinner profit margins for fitness tracking firms.
| \* A smaller pie means less hype (this is the one I'm least sure about)

Maybe this isn't bad news -- it depends on your perspective and hopes for QS. More people will be using these pedometers, after all. It's just that it'll be clearer that they're pedometers.
