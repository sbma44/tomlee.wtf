Carlos Ruiz Zafon is a talented writer and a miraculous self-promoter. *The Angel's Game* -- like *The Shadow of the Wind* -- will leave you convinced that you've read a better book than you have. But that doesn't mean you shouldn't read it.

In the case of TAG, the approach is fairly straightforward. Ruiz Zafon reverentially invokes the institution of Literature in all its forms, from a refuge for the young; to the pretentious journalistic elevation of copyediting into a sacred crusade; to the fucking smell of books; to the invocation of Dickens to canonize the institution of the blood- and melodrama-soaked potboiler.

This is all fine so far as it goes. Its real purpose is to telegraph what's about to come -- to create a theology of letters in which pulp holds a place of esteem no less dignified than nominally loftier stuff. Ruiz Zafon is going to give us pulp. He wants us to understand it to be exalted pulp.

I think this perspective is basically right. It reminds me of Michael Chabon's essays insisting that literature can include acts of imagination, excitement, adventure and the fantastic. As I steel myself for this year's Man Booker long list, it's good to be reminded that "good" books don't necessarily have to be about terminal illness and divorce.

Still, I do think that this framing is at least a little self-serving. Which is fine: Ruiz Zafon delivers a real page-turner, and ably adorns it with literary allusions and devices (albeit occasionally heavy-handed ones). The book has some problems with pacing, and the emotional pallette favors breadth over depth. But it's pretty great entertainment, ably weaving together thrills, supernatural horror, sexual tension, tragic romance, satire, noir and light comedy.

But I do worry that I will remember that this book is good more than I'll remember what the book is about. That's certainly the case with *The Shadow of the Wind* -- I remember where I read it, I and I remember liking it, but I remember terribly little of the book itself, which is pretty unusual for me. Perhaps TAG will fare better.
