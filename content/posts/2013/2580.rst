| A pretty solid spy novel focusing on transhuman technology that approximates telepathy. Lots of technological cleverness on display--the author clearly understands that world on a deep level, creating magical hand waving only when it comes to nanotechnology. Good, contemporary evocation of the surveillance state and repressive American security apparatus.
| The characterizations are thin and the philosophical point a bit hand-wavy. It's quite clear where the author's heart lies: a Panglossian substitution of technological inevitability and ethics. His imagination of the post-Nexus world is a bit less inspiring than I would've liked, and the factions vying for control of it a little underdeveloped and cartoonish. Repetitive prose, too.
| Still, pretty fun, tons of action, interesting and semiplausible technology.
