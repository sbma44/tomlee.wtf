Alright, enough hectoring.  Better news!  Tomorrow we're having a fundraiser for work, and I hope you'll consider coming.  It's at Tabaq, it's $20, there's an hour-long open bar, there'll be a raffle for various exciting prizes (coffeemaker! kindle! other stuff!), and `the band that'll be playing <http://www.myspace.com/finnriggins>`__ is actually pretty good (also, preposterously/awesomely, their guitar player is named Lisa Simpson).  You should come!
