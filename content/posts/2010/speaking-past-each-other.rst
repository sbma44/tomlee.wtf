I like `Penny Arcade <http://www.penny-arcade.com>`__ quite a lot, but `this <http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/>`__ is a `really terrible argument <http://www.penny-arcade.com/2010/4/21/>`__ to make in response to `Roger Ebert's equally terrible argument that video games can never be art <http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2010/04/video_games_can_never_be_art.html>`__:

All you can really say about this is that neither side knows what the hell the other side is talking about.
