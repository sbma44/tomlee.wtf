I just put up a post over at the Sunlight Labs blog detailing `the electronic adventures involved in getting our office door on the network <http://www.sunlightlabs.com/blog/2010/our-door-opener-science-project/>`__.  Still to come: a post detailing how my colleagues made the system accessible via iPhone, Droid, and plain-ol' telephone system (with an assist from `Twilio <http://www.twilio.com>`__). I still need to solder in a bypass capacitor -- the circuit's not performing *quite* as securely as it did in the breadboard (although with a door made of glass it's not like we're securing Fort Knox).  But in general I'm really pleased with how this project turned out.
