|image1|\ In four and a half short hours I should be on a plane, winging my way to Tbilisi, `finally </2009/11/16/the-domestication-of-the-dog-continues-unabated/>`__, to give `TI Georgia <http://transparency.ge>`__ a hand with their website, mobile strategy, and whatever else they have on hand that takes electricity.

I'm supposed to spend 12 hours in Vienna along the way, so if anyone has any particularly good ideas about how to utilize a brief Austrian lunchtime interlude, please let me know.  I half-suspect those hours will be used up on tortuous sleep in the airport: normally I would be feeling good about my prospects for rest during the flight, having just bought the CVS generic antihistamine with the most severe-sounding warning about operating heavy machinery that I could find.  But I came down with a cold this weekend, and am several years older than the last time I dealt with serious jetlag, and generally suspect that waking up early could kill me.

Despite this, it should be fun!  I'm looking forward to seeing Georgia, a country that's possessed an incredible mystique for me ever since I read Susan's writing about it (more recent reports from my colleague Ryan have done nothing to diminish the myth).  It's a little strange to be leaving the office so soon after getting back from Costa Rica, but I think the trip is going to be worth the disruption.

And yes, I haven't yet written up any of the additional Costa Rica blog posts I intend to write.  I still intend to write them!  Who knows, hotel-bound paralysis born of pathetic language skills just might make it happen...
