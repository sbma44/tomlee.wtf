It's a very good movie. You should go see it.  I don't have much more to say about it than that.

What I do want to observe, though, is that the reaction to the movie on Twitter has been fascinating.  A surprising number of people are leaping to Zuckerberg's defense.  Many are linking to `this account <http://gawker.com/5643915/mark-zuckerberg-describes-the-dirty-tricks-that-led-to-the-facebook-movie>`__ of the legal maneuvering dramatized by the film -- an account which doesn't actually exculpate Zuckerberg, but is written as if the author thinks it does.  Even more astounding are posts like `this one <http://alexpriest.com/2010/10/04/perhaps-the-digital-divide-is-much-bigger-than-we-thought/>`__, which lionize Zuckerberg as a sort of Nietzschean hero.

It's all a little weird.  People clearly have reservoirs of affection for and identification with the founder of Facebook. Presumably this is because of what his invention means to them.  I suppose that's fine.

But let me offer my predictable cranky technologist perspective.  Zuckerberg is wildly successful, and I don't begrudge him that.  Nor do I find myself particularly outraged on behalf of the various people he seems to have betrayed, all of whom are now even more astoundingly wealthy than they started out being.

There's a strange tendency in this country to declare everyone who's *extremely rich* to be some sort of visionary genius, whose unprecedented perspective allowed a break from the chains of history.  This is ridiculous.  Mark Zuckerberg did not invent social networking.  His achievement at Harvard wasn't even that remarkable: 400 unique visitors to a just-launched website is great, but hardly unprecedented.  Nor are his technological achievements all that impressive: assuming the movie's depiction to be accurate -- and I suspect it basically is, judging by the tasks he was performing -- he seems like a strong web developer, but not any kind of wunderkind (Facebook's ability to operate at its current scale using a hugely rewritten version of PHP is a genuinely impressive achievement, but the entry-level LAMP stuff Zuckerberg himself did is simple enough).

What Facebook did was deploy an extremely effective marketing scheme -- one based on exclusivity -- at exactly the right  moment.  From there, network effects took over and delivered success.  This is an impressive commercial achievement, but it is not a triumph of vision or technical skill.  `Depending on your perspective, you might not even consider it to be particularly admirable <http://www.danah.org/papers/talks/PDF2009.html>`__.

In the absence of Zuckerberg, `someone else would have almost certainly come along and stolen Myspace's thunder <http://voices.washingtonpost.com/ezra-klein/2010/10/zuckerberg_zuckerberg_zuckerbe.html>`__ -- just as someone or something will surely supplant Facebook before its `ludicrous valuation <http://37signals.com/svn/posts/2585-facebook-is-not-worth-33000000000>`__ is realized.  Zuckerberg is not one of history's great men -- he's just one of its richest.
