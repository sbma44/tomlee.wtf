Tim is one of the very few people I know of who can product posts like `this one <http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2010/06/the-blurring-line-between-amateur-and-professional/58639/>`__: posts which, when I'm finished reading them, seem so perfectly clear, cogent and direct that it's hard to find a single word I'd care to quibble with.  Not that I agree with him all the time, of course.  But this time I do (actually, I'm probably willing to go `somewhat </2007/04/20/giant-nazi-robots/>`__ `further </2007/01/31/its-all-just-bits/>`__ out on this limb than Tim).

This makes me wonder, though, about the compensation structure of top-tier professional writers.  I have a hard time believing that Charles Murray is feeling the financial pinch of the collapsing media industry, his complaints about Times op-ed rates notwithstanding.  It seems a lot more likely to me that his compensation has shifted away from writing-for-hire and toward various cushy sinecures.  Rich people tend to have friends who'll help them stay rich, after all.  I have a feeling that `the way things went down at the Chicago Tribune <http://www.chicagobusiness.com/cgi-bin/news.pl?id=33794>`__ is fairly typical.  Or maybe I just took that last season of The Wire a bit too much to heart.

Anyway, rich get richer, proletariat squeezed, dog bites man, Fox News Edge at 11.
