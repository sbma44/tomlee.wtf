Sure, they say `crime is down <http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hB3QGFJ85G28otgVt58qar23428Q>`__. But you've gotta think that the incidence of stabbings where the murder weapon mysteriously can't be found is way, way up.  Also, hanging suicides in locked rooms with high ceilings and wet floors.

I am going semi-crazy from spending so many consecutive days in the house, clinging to small totems of civilization (showering, tooth-brushing, occasional pajama rotation).  But it has been a good opportunity to make progress on various web projects that have been on the back burner for a while -- a site for my mom, and another, stupider site that I hope to share with you before too long.
