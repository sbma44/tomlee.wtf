And I was thinking that I wasn't going to emerge thrilled about the book, but once through the (necessary) parts about Oscar's mom it gets pretty great. How can you not want to be Yunior's friend? (er, at the point in the story where I am, I should say. Maybe something terrible happens. Well, okay, obviously something terrible is going to happen; maybe Yunior's complicit, I mean).

I have no other media recommendations to make, other than to note that Russian sitcoms dubbed into Georgian don't seem as funny to me as they do to the guys in the bar downstairs. Or it may be that it's all about sophisticated wordplay; hard to say.
