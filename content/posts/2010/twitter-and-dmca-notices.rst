Here, `read this <http://jpsblog.net/2010/04/22/twitter-is-now-giving-out-dmca-take-down-notices/>`__.  The author got his tweet removed via a DMCA takedown notice that read like this:

   | jp917, Apr 22 03:10 pm (PDT):
   | Hello,
   | The following material has been removed from your account in response to a DMCA take-down notice:
   | Tweet: http://twitter.com/jp917/statuses/12499491144 – New Post: Leaked: The National – High Violet http://jpsblog.net/2010/04/20/leaked-the-national-high-violet/

As he points out, this didn't actually point to any copyright-violating files.  The link just discusses the leak.

I don't think this is deliberate suppression of the *discussion* of piracy.  What I think is probably happening is this:

#. Copyright-holding Corporation A pays Technical Vendor B to monitor Twitter for leaked albums. They can do this cheaply by creating an automated process that looks for band names and the word "leaked", or through some other simple heuristic.
#. Matching results are turned into DMCA takedown notices with a minimum (or no?) human intervention.
#. Twitter receives the notices, removes the user's content and notifies the user with a minimum (or no?) human intervention.

The user is then free to make a counterclaim!  Unfortunately, there is not a button or script for that.  Before long he or she will have to pick up the phone, find a lawyer, and pay that lawyer to fight on their behalf.

This is flatly unacceptable.  The need for a DMCA-style simplification of the takedown process is understandable, but this level of automation of the process should not be tolerated.  As currently structured, it's a surefire recipe for Type I errors.  We've known this about the DMCA takedown process all along, of course, but this really brings it into stark relief -- there's a huge power asymmetry introduced by the DMCA, so much so that the rights-holders it empowers can't even be bothered to follow a link and read a paragraph.  Why would they?  There's no incentive for them to.

There ought to be substantial sanctions -- payable to the counterclaimant -- that can be recovered when copyright holders suppress legal content through spurious claims.  Let's get some of those much-maligned trial lawyers up in here.
