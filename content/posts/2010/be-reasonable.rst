I hate being a NIMBY. The truth about city life is that it's crowded. Not unpleasantly so, not most of the time, but you're going to find yourself around a lot of your fellow men, and sometimes they'll get in your way and sometimes you'll get in theirs. It's your responsibility to try to hold your tongue in the case of the former and count on your obliviousness to the latter to even everything out. If everyone threw a fit about every inconvenience they had to suffer, none of us could enjoy the things that are great about living together.

But I think the disruptions accompanying the nuclear disarmament summit at the convention center go a bit beyond the normal give and take of city life. I hasten to add that I haven't suffered much personal inconvenience -- walking a few extra blocks on Sunday evening has been about the worst of it. My discomfort is more about how the event feels than what it's done to me, and maybe that means my objections should be ignored. But it's disturbing to see the streets barricaded, to feel suspicious eyes on you as you walk from the grocery story and past an idling Humvee. I don't like that the folks living in the apartments on the same block as the convention center are being physically searched before being allowed into their homes. I don't like that businesses in the area have had to shut down for the duration of the summit.

And it's hard for me to really see the case for hosting this event. DC has a lot of non-negotiable obligations to the federal government, many of them understandable. But the convention center? It's still a business, right? They could have said no, right? That they're sorry, but they can't handle the security requirements; that the economic boost that a convention is supposed to bring would, in this case, be swamped by the disruptions that would ripple across the city; that the city's facilities exist for its residents, and the proposal on the table asked them to make sacrifices without receiving comparable benefits.

Maybe they could have said this, but I think they probably didn't. And now a commuter has died `what sounds like a truly horrific death <http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/archives/2010/04/cyclist-killed-by-military-vehicle.php/comment-page-2#comment-1809745>`__ because of the decision to try to protect and accommodate the world's most important people in the middle of a working city.

I'm sorry to be upset by this, because I know this city is filled with suffering that I easily shrug off. It's stupid that I feel angry just because she and I got to work the same way.

But I am angry. Because people online are blaming the victim. Because the security equipment used to protect our leaders has continued to grow even as the threats they face have withered. Mostly because it could easily have been me, or someone I know.

I know it's the federal city. We will grit our teeth and mostly go along, thinking little of pausing for the daily motorcades down Connecticut, contenting ourselves with grumbling half-heartedly about a commuter tax from time to time.

But now that the planners' ever-escalating *24* fetishization has shown its deadly potential, it needs to be put in check. Military vehicles do not belong within city limits. I'm all for nuclear disarmament, but I hope federal officials take their next high-risk party to a more appropriate location. I intend to insist that city leaders do what they can to make that happen.
