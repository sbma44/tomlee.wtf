Oh! Hello there! I'm not in Costa Rica any more, it turns out.  Actually, I've been back since Saturday evening, but I've been too busy growing an entirely new layer of skin to write anything here.  That process is now wrapping up, which leaves just the photo editing and fighting with Picasa-to-Flickr uploading (but then it turned out to be a network proxy problem) and then realizing that my `Flickr/Lightbox gallery script </2006/10/26/fun-with-lightbox-and-booze/>`__ didn't make it past the move to Wordpress, and considering writing a WP plugin to fix it but then deciding to try out a half dozen until I finally found `this one <http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/flickr-tag/installation/>`__ which does what I want. Whew.

What? Right, Central America.  Emily and I just spent 7 days in Costa Rica, driving through mountains, clouds and grids of oil palms, attempting the full volcano/cloud forest/beach trifecta.  I want to write about each of those things, but for now you'll have to be satisfied with some pictures.
