I made my first EAGLE schematic!  I'm sure it's horribly broken, but I'm still feeling pretty good about it.

| If you're interested in getting the source file, head over to `the post on Sunlight Labs <http://sunlightlabs.com/blog/2010/our-door-opener-science-project/>`__.  And if you do, please be gentle.  Advice on what I've gotten wrong would be welcome, though.

**ALSO:** Thanks to the diligent outreach efforts of Sunlight's own Nicko Margolies, the original post has now been picked up by `Hack-a-Day <http://hackaday.com/2010/02/23/more-cellphone-controlled-door-locks/#comments>`__ and `MAKE <http://blog.makezine.com/archive/2010/02/android_controlled_door_opening_lin.html>`__. Neat! And better still, educational: I've already had a number of revisions suggested to me by the Hack-a-Day `commenters <http://hackaday.com/2010/02/23/more-cellphone-controlled-door-locks/#comments>`__.

**ALSO ALSO:** `Engadget, too <http://www.engadget.com/2010/02/25/linksys-router-turned-into-smartphone-controlled-doorman-video/>`__! Though I've gotta say: *man* are the commenters there morons.

|it'd be so money, bro|

The wages of internet success, I suppose.

**AAAAAND:** `Gizmodo <http://gizmodo.com/5480362/the-nerdiest-way-youll-see-a-door-opened-all-week>`__. That'll just about do it, I think. Their commenters are *mean*. Which I *like*. I want the apparent EE to offer some more information, though.  I think he's at least partly wrong.
