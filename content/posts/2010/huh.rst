Nothing like trying to fix some small part of your blog to uncover *endless problems* with the Movable Type to Wordpress migration you performed months ago.  Well, various embedded Flickr galleries have been recreated, and you'll be pleased to know that posts from 2006 to 2009 that had single-word titles can once again load properly. Like `this one <http://www.manifestdensity.net/2007/02/19/superheroics/>`__. Thank goodness.
