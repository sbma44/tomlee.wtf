It's already turned into a great day for `making an ass out of myself <http://twitter.com/sbma44/status/7445279063>`__, so why not just get it all out of the way at once?  Yesterday `Fox 5 asked me to talk about the new Google phone <http://www.myfoxdc.com/dpp/money/google-unveils-nexus-one-superphone-010510>`__, for some reason. It was very nice of them, and they asked smart questions, and I did my best to fool them into thinking I was as qualified to speak about it as the people from whom I've stolen all my opinions.

I won't deepen my d-baggery by pretending that I don't enjoy this sort of thing (MUST FEED RAVENOUS EGO) but I know I don't have a natural talent for being on camera, and it really does make my skin crawl to watch myself.  On the plus side, the microsecond of Tom-provided content that they used contained one of my less-asinine pronouncements; I got them to avoid saying "**the** DCist"; and I pitched Mrs. Alnwick on doing a story about HacDC.  I'm told there might be more on tonight's 10 pm newscast.

Anyway, just to be perfectly clear: yes, I am a complete fraud.
