I asked this on Twitter last night, then quickly backed off, deferring to smarter friends to explain their outrage over the spending freeze that the President is proposing. I mean, in general I get it: we're liberals, we believe the government needs to expand in various ways, and we'd like to have some freedom to spend on our policy priorities while we're in power. It seems stupid for the president to tie his hands behind his back without even extracting concessions for doing so.

But then I think about the actual agenda: I'd put HCR, addressing climate change and dismantling the terrorball apparatus at the top of my list, as, I think, would most progressives. A spending freeze doesn't really preclude any of them\*. In fact, all of them are potential deficit reducers!

Plus this, `via Kevin Drum <http://motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2010/01/little-night-music>`__, just seems entirely wrong:

   conservative Rich Lowry shows via Twitter that he understands why, even if the White House doesn't: "spending freeze, no matter how notional, is a huge ceding of rhetorical grnd by WH. will give GOP more leverage in makng anti-hcr, stim case."

You say "ceding", I say "co-opting". Reading `Dave's piece from yesterday <http://washingtonindependent.com/74687/tea-partiers-and-freedomworks-craft-a-2010-agenda>`__, I was left with the impression that the alliance between establishment conservatives and the tea partiers -- the only actually vibrant part of the right at the moment -- is tenuous at best ("...and starring Newt Gingrich as Ahmed Chalabi!"). Maybe I'm being naive, but it seems to me like signaling a commitment to the teabaggers' (admittedly incoherent) concerns about fiscal responsibility could do a lot to confuse that burgeoning relationship. If it can be done without seriously endangering social welfare entitlements; without affecting the party's main policy initiatives; and hey, maybe even with it as cover for going after a few things like `farm subsidies <http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/archives/2010/01/obama-budget-to-call-for-freeze-in-non-security-discretionary-spending.php>`__, then that all sounds okay to me.

Anyway, consider this `another plea </2010/01/12/in-which-my-ignorance-of-finance-is-revealed/>`__ for explaining the obvious thing(s) I'm missing. At the moment I find myself convinced that this strategy `could blow up quite easily <http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/archives/2010/01/what-will-the-spending-freeze-amount-to.php>`__. Certainly the last few weeks haven't instilled a ton of confidence in the Democrats' political skill. In fact, odds of this play working seem low!  The idea that defusing this *one last minority critique* will yield dividends is a mistake that's been made many times in the past few months.  Still, this specific proposal doesn't seem obviously crazy to me, or even that destructive.  And though I'm in no position to say, it seems likely that *somebody* in the administration thinks it'll help in the fall.

\* Obviously another stimulus becomes untenable under this proposal. Was that really all that likely, though?

**UPDATE:** `Yikes <http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/26/obama-liquidates-himself/>`__. Okay.

**BUT ALSO:** `This <http://motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2010/01/spending-freeze-kabuki>`__. Which seems dumb, but okay.  "It's almost certain that Congress will pass, and the president will sign, a jobs bill", though? Well, okay, maybe!  I don't know how to read all these sorts of tea leaves, and I'm not on any secret listservs or conference calls or anything like that. But it kind of seems to me like the Republicans have been complaining about ARRA's (alleged -- but absolute!) ineffectiveness for a while now, laying the groundwork for obstruction of any last-ditch effort to fix the economy before the election (which should be done! But c'mon, at this point it obviously won't save anybody.).  I mean, yes, clearly everyone is about to start *talking* about jobs.  I'm unclear on why folks think that'll turn into something, though.
