Or rather, posts I am *so* unqualified to write that even *I* am not comfortable writing them (but I wish Julian or Yglesias or Dylan Matthews or Matt Zeitlin or anyone else who's done some of the relevant reading would):

If our world really is a `hologram <http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20126911.300-our-world-may-be-a-giant-hologram.html?page=1>`__\ \*, what does is mean for the philosophy of mind that phenomenal experience\* seems to occur at the holographic level rather than at the level of the lower-dimensional surface\* (or brane, more technically, I guess)?  Does it bolster the case for consciousness-as-epiphenomenon (I think maybe, if the hologram can be created in multiple ways with varying underlying conditions, it nudges us toward an explicitly supervenient relationship)?

\* I realize that all of these sound like the sort of nonsense that freshmen would ponder while stoned.  But that's only half right: it's not actually nonsense.
