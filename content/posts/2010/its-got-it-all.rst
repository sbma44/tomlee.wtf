One thing you have to say for the iPad: it sits right in the middle of three classic consumer hardware debates: fat/thin client; walled garden/libre; and information appliance/general purpose device.  I have no idea whether this position makes it a better device, but it sure does generate a lot of passionate (though fundamentally boring-and-cliched-as-hell) blog posts.

The libre/walled garden is the only one I find even remotely interesting, and that only because of the cultural considerations it embodies -- see `this post <http://al3x.net/2010/01/28/ipad.html>`__ from Alex Payne for more on that.  `Those making the assumption that the iPad represents some unitary future for computing <http://io9.com/5458822/why-the-ipad-is-crap-futurism>`__\ \* are being quite silly, I think -- that's not going to happen.  But it's worth reading Alex's post to understand *why* that admittedly-unlikely event would be `a terrible thing for people like him and me <http://mill-industries.com/post/341-breaking-curfew>`__.

\* Incidentally: any time you read something that approvingly quotes an expert whose listed credential is "futurist", you should immediately dismiss it outright, and possibly also phone in a bomb threat to the publishing organization.  Also: SixthSense is a neat tech demo, but assuming it works as well as the video is an astounding act of credulousness.  Besides, `no one wants to look that dumb in public <http://www.google.com/search?q=snow%20crash%20gargoyle>`__.
