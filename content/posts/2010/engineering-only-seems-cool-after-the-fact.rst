`The American Prospect <http://www.prospect.org/cs/articles?article=the_curated_web>`__ on `Trivium <http://chneukirchen.org/trivium/2010-03-16>`__!  Worlds colliding!  It's great!

I read the article, though, and found myself disagreeing with its author, Marisa Meltzer.  How can you provide an accounting of Tumblr's success and not use the word "Gawker" once?  The service was launched in New York in the right kind of scene, was pitched in the right kind of way, attracted the right kind of writers, and grew from there. Like so many successful products, you can't simply run Tumblr's featureset backward through the perfectly-deterministic mechanism of the imagined market and arrive at a proper accounting of why it succeeded and its competitors failed.

I agree that it's worth talking about the subtle mechanics of the site -- how there's a thumbs-up mechanism but no thumbs-down; I think the consolidation of reader and blog into a single form is a genuinely interesting idea. But Meltzer's account seemed to me a bit like explaining the success of the iPod via a discussion of its clickwheel.
