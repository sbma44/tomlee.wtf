In the spirit of [losing less writing output to Twitter](/2025/12/15/a-fresh-coat-of-paint/), here's something I posted last week that got a surprising amount of attention.

It seems very likely to me that [we're in the early days of a new temperance movement for online gambling](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/10/02/americans-increasingly-see-legal-sports-betting-as-a-bad-thing-for-society-and-sports/). The ferocious pace at which the industry expanded has resulted in some intense victimization. Sports fans dislike the ads, and the people who have been financially exploited despise the whole thing. Weaning government budgets off the revenue won't be easy, but I think there's plenty of room for federal action.

The point I tried to make in the thread quoted below is that this kind of exploitation is increasingly visible in other consumer-facing services. I hope that this tendency can be understood and addressed at the same time.

A decade ago, Jeff Hammerbacher famously lamented that, "The best minds of my generation are thinking about how to make people click ads." But it's gotten so much worse since then.

The above ad makes me smile and wince. But it makes me want to say: at least it's not B2C. Because it increasingly feels like there is no useful work to be done in consumer-facing technology. For the current envelope of achievable capabilities, everything has been optimized and then nestled into an insurmountable cross-subsidization scheme at some impossibly large company. All that remains is to join one of them, then for a rolling cast of product managers to conduct an approximately infinite series of meetings in which they slowly talk themselves into cheating or exploiting the end user just a _little_ bit more with each major release.

It feels like it's the only thing left, the only source of growth, and that eventually a product team's foundational imperatives will force it down ethical ravines that would feel completely alien and dark to their predecessors. You started out letting people share photos of their day with friends; passed through an insane drowning rat cage of vanity, jealousy, and celebrity; and now you're sticking your userbase into a virtual veal pen and feeding them AI generated videos tuned by robots to be impossible to look away from? From sharing cute kid photos and pics of a memorable dinner to creating the conditions by which hundreds of millions of people realize, with dazed confusion, that they've been scrolling on the toilet for half an hour. Grim!

I hope we can find a set of constraints that protect not only our users but also those charged with creating and growing consumer tech from sliding down this spiral. Humans' highly evolved behaviors are not going to change in our lifetimes. Our only option is to protect ourselves from abusing what has become a troublingly perfect understanding of them.

Here's the thread, lightly edited. After its publication I was DMed by a former Zynga PM who told me a story about sending iPads to some of their big-spending VIP customers as a thank you. He remembered one saying "thanks, but I would've rather gotten more virtual coins".

I really appreciate [this piece](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/07/opinion/meta-facebook-ruling-algorithms.html) from @ezraklein
 (and its amplification by @mattyglesias). But I think the ideas being teased out here would benefit from [a prescient article that Alexis Madrigal wrote more than a decade ago](https://theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/07/the-machine-zone-this-is-where-you-go-when-you-just-cant-stop-looking-at-pictures-on-facebook/278185/).

I've been reading [Addiction by Design](https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691160887/addiction-by-design?srsltid=AfmBOopgy1ZUvF7dYeD1VttjZSwCe02_X2tOLePx5HIcRYl0RIaypFet). Madrigal does a good job of conveying its most important insight: that slot machine gamblers seek an altered state--a sort of ego death called "the zone"--while machine operators seek revenue.

What isn't fully conveyed is just how alien, animalistic, pre-human "the zone" is. People describe being unable to move from a machine, for hours, even as they experience intense pain and risk soiling themselves. Casino operators write manuals recounting their observation that the most profitable machines are located in nooks and alcoves--people like a casino floor that is both expansive and warren-like, stimulating but monotonous, and then within it, they seek a niche for refuge, where they can pursue the zone.

When I was at @SunFoundation we were visited by a technologist who wanted to join the civic tech mission. He had just made his fortune at Zynga. he described how they did their work. The games must be free to play, players must be able to achieve things, receive a reward signal--but only for a while. Rventually the rewards become more meager, and achievement becomes impossible--unless in-game currency (or whatever else) is purchased. He told us this psychological discomfort was called "pinch" within the industry. Identifying the right time to introduce pinch was an art and science, and foundational to their business.

(He also explained that most of their revenue came from a small number of "whales" who spent enormous amounts in the games. I think this is better-known -- it's the same w/ booze and gambling.)

These behaviors exist in all of us and, in at least some of us, can be called forth in a form that's almost unimaginably potent. They have little to do with the things we think of as making us human. Their expression is debasing, a process of degradation.

I think Madrigal saw earlier than most that our nascent attention industries were inexorably recreating the knowledge and inventions that casino operators had developed in earlier decades. Perhaps the pace at which an industry hones these skills depends on the scale and intensity of the revenue loop, the complicating details of the pretext under which the industry conceals the zone? There is a purity to a video screen with a bill feeder, cut free from any constraints but what some Gaming Commission bureaucrats dream up.

No doubt things are more baroque when you're laboring to embody the trappings of a videogame or social network. But eventually, optimization will lead us to rediscover the animalistic parts of ourselves, and competitive forces will find & reward whoever is willing to exploit them.

What Madrigal missed is that the apps weren't yet done optimizing. And I think he was not willing to seem hysterical by describing their evolutionary destination as the moral grotesquerie that it is.

I think we tie ourselves in knots over this stuff because the behaviors associated with seeking the zone can be understood through the lens of an enlightened conception of liberty. but helping others find the zone is not freeing them. it's binding them to their inescapable primal selves.

I don't think any of this is in tension with where Ezra is gesturing. But I do think we can skip to the end. We should see what the endpoint of these optimization processes is, and excuse ourselves from handwringing over whether we ought to stop it. We should.
