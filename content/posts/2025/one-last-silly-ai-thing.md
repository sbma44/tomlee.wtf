My Spotify Wrapped was less embarrassing than it could have been--I am frozen in time in the late aughts, but that's fine with me. But it reminded me to take on one more "if only I had the time" project.

My beloved dishwasher is internet-connected (of course). Mostly, this affords me push notifications that send me sprinting downstairs whenever the spray arm is blocked. But it also fires off an IFTTT task whenever a load completes, populating a Google Sheet that's perennially at the top of my "most recently edited" list.

I made some graphs, then asked the recently launched Google Nano Banana Pro image generation model to create an infographic. The jokes are my own--figuring out when Thanksgiving occurred was not something I asked the model to do, and the cycle used for a load is not actually reported to the spreadsheet. I'll claim credit for the Auto/Otto pun, too. But the numbers are all real, and the visual design is entirely thanks to the AI model, with only a few rounds of feedback from me. I had to drop in the graphs with Affinity Photo, but this model is very impressive for this kind of task.

I was pleased by the response, and especially by [Drew Bruenig joining in the fun](https://bsky.app/profile/dbreunig.bsky.social/post/3m7dwgudaws2c). I also cherish the [reply](https://bsky.app/profile/swozey.bsky.social/post/3m7djd675rc2g) that deemed it "the most depressing this [he's] ever seen"--and yes, I am a parent!

I think [a lot of people don't realize--or are denying--just how impressive the current genAI models are](https://bsky.app/profile/tjl.bsky.social/post/3ma6vwpvwhc25). That's partly willful ignorance. But it's also partly the fact that leading-edge image generation requires enough compute that Google is charging for it. That means that to use it, you need to sign up for an expensive Gemini Plan or figure out how to connect a Google Developer account with billing details to their AI Studio web app (I did the latter). These barriers won't last for long, though.

I'm on the record as rooting for an AI plateau, acknowledging that a ton of disruption is already guaranteed based on the progress that has been achieved, but hoping we could pause for a moment as we figure out a recognizable human future. I had been feeling pretty good about that. But the last few weeks have shaken my confidence.
