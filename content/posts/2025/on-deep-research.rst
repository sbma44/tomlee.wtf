`Read Benedict Evans <https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2025/2/17/the-deep-research-problem>`__, who scorns how it amasses stats on an area in which he's an expert.

Read `this thread <https://x.com/buccocapital/status/1891473002639868282?s=46>`__ to see how it does with SEC filings. I haven't validated every number it cites, but it appears quite impressive.

The value of analysis is set to plummet. The value of authoritative data is going to rise.

Simultaneously, antipathy toward AI in general and its access to data in particular will skyrocket among the creative classes, then knowledge workers, then the rest of the Democratic coalition. Openness will be going into retreat.

This makes me sad. It's a very surprising reversal of technological progression's normal effects. But the seeds were already planted as platforms began to move beyond meeting their audience's whims and on toward molding them. You don't need an open web for that.

I still think that collecting value by gating knowledge is disreputable. And it's certainly not going to result in the value being distributed equitably. But, at the moment, we humans probably ought to cling to any economic redoubt we can muster.
