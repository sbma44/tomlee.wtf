[![words per year](/static/2025/12/words_per_year_bar.png)](/static/2025/12/words_per_year_bar.png)

I have been writing a personal blog since 2006, apparently!

I fell in love with technology because I feared scarcity, and because, in this world, digital technology is the only real cure for it. Never having to throw anything away is a close corrolary. So it's unsurprising that each time I have moved between domains or web hosts I have remembered to hit the "export" button in Wordpress and dragged along years of online exclamations, like so many brambles stuck to my pant legs.

I never did much more than that, and the situation got steadily worse. Broken links accumulated. Google stopped indexing my posts for reasons I never bothered to investigate. This was okay, because I mostly stopped writing them. My locus of discussion and attention moved to Twitter, which of course I now regret. But I'm not sure what I would have done differently. Increasingly, what I perceived to be my professional obligations meant that I didn't want to say anything permanent on the internet. Or I at least felt I probably shouldn't, even when I did anyway.Blogging had professionalized and then died long ago, and social media seemed to be its replacement, even after it, too, stratified and then ossified.

When social media collapsed--thank you shareholder avarice and executive insanity, genuinely--amateurs reemerged on Substack. But this, too, was no good for me. I had gotten out of the habit of being prolific, and my taste for the sound of my own voice had become, if not healthily diminished, then at least perversely specific.

There are still a few of you who seem to subscribe to this site's feed. I find that quite flattering and more than a little sweet. But--with apologies to whoever was the first to coin this cliche--I have accepted that the best reason for me to write here is so that I can learn what I think.

That is a good reason! I find myself happier when I have recently written something. I like looking back and knowing who I was, or that I had been busy doing something. Forcing nascent musings out is good for my overall clarity of thought. Perhaps not as good as harder kinds of writing (I average maybe two words of a long-simmering fiction project per day). But good for me nonetheless. I also wish I'd captured more of my output here, rather than on the even more ephemeral and stigma-prone outlet of social media.

All of this makes for enough reason to turn the site into something less awful, which I assure you, it was. Even apart from the broken links, the underlying foundation was in desperately poor shape. PHP is embarrassing for reasons I cannot fully convey to anyone who does not know the word "Drupalcon". Wordpress is the normiest of CMSes, and I had long ago fallen in with a hipper crowd, taught to cram every web idea into a static site generator-shaped mould.

None of the work associated with moving to such a setup was particularly hard, but I knew there was a lot of it. I never got around to summoning the effort to improve my aesthetics, despite the increasingly exorbitant renewal invoices I received from my meager shared-hosting provider as its ownership changed once, twice, three times.

You probably see where this is going. LLMs change what's possible, not only in terms of skill but in terms of time and effort. If the import tool produces a bunch of broken RST files, I don't have to learn a tedious markup format and correct them. I can ask Claude to to it. If I have an old zip file with orphaned JPEGs from mid-aughts blog posts, and some slightly-mismatched HREFs, I can think up a script to rewrite everything that's broken, then hand the grunt work off to my robot. I can even tell it to look at the Wordpress theme I bought years ago and adapt its bones to an entirely new context.

So: the site is now built with [Pelican](https://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/index.html), a pythonic alternative to Jekyll, and hosted on Github Pages. The sitemap is fixed, and the remaining broken links are either there intentionally or as a quiet monument to the ephemerality of the internet. I have to manage one old RSS redirect via Cloudflare, which feels janky, but otherwise my technical house feels better-kept than it has been in years.

Of course, it's been hard to do any of this without accidentally reading my old writing. And: woof. It's funny, people often used to tell me I was a good writer back then, but my writing from that era is naive and packed with cliches. It is often callow and self-satisfied, sometimes performatively cruel toward people I don't know.

Still, I don't want to delete it. It's a time capsule. More importantly, I aspire to empathy for that younger version of myself, if only because, as I write this, I hope to one day make similar impositions on a future me.

The shape of that demand is already discernible. Free from worrying about readers, I've mostly stopped trying to entertain and please others and instead luxuriated in indulging myself. The purplest prose! No darlings killed, each one cooed and fussed over instead.

Having so much newly-clean data in hand made it conceivable that these changes could shown empirically, so I asked Claude for one more favor: make me some charts! A fun idea, I thought. I was surprised to see such a constant result. My writing's statistical attributes haven't changed that much (excluding aberrant numbers from the period when I barely wrote anything at all).

I suppose it's good news that [my brains aren't yet leaking out my ears](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2772766125000977), and that my emdash problem peaked in 2007. But I hope there have been changes I don't know how to quantify, too. It would be a shame if there weren't.
