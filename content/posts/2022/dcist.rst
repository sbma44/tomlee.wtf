I was close to DCist from its earliest days. I initially supplied behind-the-scenes support, like fixing Movable Type templates, hosting the staff mailing list, and building `ridiculous <https://dcist.com/story/06/05/09/introducing-las/>`__ technical `projects <https://dcist.com/story/07/07/13/dcist-maps-come/>`__. But I wrote for the site, too--more and more as time went by--and had a seat at the table during editorial conversations.

My writing for DCist mostly took the form of Morning Roundup posts--the kind of link aggregation that was the bread & butter of the mid-aughts internet. Unglamorous? I guess. But that early morning responsibility had to be done by someone who could be trusted to hit publish without editorial oversight, and it gave our editor-in-chief a well-deserved break. I took pride in it. It also meant I could entrench a tradition of horrible puns and alliteration without anyone being able to stop me.

By the time my run with DCist had concluded, I'd authored 344 posts. I'm particularly fond of `Dissecting the SmarTrip <https://dcist.com/story/05/12/14/dissecting-the/>`__, `Frightening Films and the District's Dracula <https://dcist.com/story/06/10/17/frightening-fil/>`__, a `Shmoo Group interview <https://dcist.com/story/06/01/10/interview-the-s/>`__, and my `off-puttingly aggressive <https://dcist.com/story/09/08/24/youve-gotta-spend-money-to-make-mon/>`__ `transit data advocacy <https://dcist.com/story/10/08/10/wmata-announces-plans-to-open-data/>`__. But there were also plenty of concert reviews, local sports coverage, and a memorable `car-racing junket <https://dcist.com/story/07/08/11/car-racing-for/>`__.

The full list is below; sadly, the site's migration to its new home at WAMU seems to have cut a bunch of content off. If you need any of these--or any other DCist content--do let me know. I'm happy to pull it from my 2017 pre-hiatus scrape of the site.
