We live in a pretty Jehovah's-Witness-heavy neighborhood, but I mostly don't mind. Sure, it means the occasional well-meaning pair of Sunday visitors will find me groggily staring at them, potentially shirtless. But that's mostly their problem — I'm perfectly happy to see them. Besides, you never know when you'll find yourself wishing you had a few dozen copies of *The Watchtower* on hand.

The best side effect, though, are the hand-addressed notes I get in the mail, which contain handwritten notes, which contain printed tracts, and all of which contain numerous spelling and grammatical errors. Still, they're preferable to the ones I used to find placed under my windshield wipers back when I had the car with `the awful front-end damage <http://flickr.com/photos/sbma44/89423228/in/set-72057594051841686/>`__; those would encourage me to seek help for my alcoholism (lucky guesses don't count!).

Anyway, here's the latest one I've received. In most respects it's pretty unremarkable, but does make a case for Bible study that I don't remember encountering before: that it will protect you from *zombies and/or ghosts*. Possibly also draculas; I'm not sure, it's been a while since Sunday School.
