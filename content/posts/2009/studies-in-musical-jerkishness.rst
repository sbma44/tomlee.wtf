I still have a whopping seventeen minutes to go until I need to head to the morning's first meeting (I am told there will be pastry), but Twitter means that I *already* have compelling internet content to share. To wit!

- `Fugazi were dicks <http://virtualista.posterous.com/this-is-not-a-fugazi-montage-0>`__. I realize this was part of the appeal, even as I simultaneously realize that (having not been a part of the Fugazi fanbase at the time of their relevance) I shouldn't claim to fully understand their appeal. Still, forget the humorlessness, the stories about straight-edge-inspired violence, the earnest para-anarchist nonsense. Just listen to the self-satisfied incredulity in that stage banter (banter admittedly being entirely the wrong word in this case). It's hard to listen to it without cringing for ever having been young.

- | `John Davis <http://www.avclub.com/dc/articles/john-davis-defends-his-nonguilty-pleasures,35822/>`__, on the other hand, proves himself to be kind of a sweetheart, even as he correctly identifies the flaws in the musical abominations that he's decided to stick up for, seemingly because he simply rejects the idea of negativity entirely. I mean, *The Pina Colada Song*? That's bold. But it's also sort of strangely big-hearted, and makes me tempted to compare Davis to my friend Chris, which Chris doesn't like because he worries that people with beards all look the same to the rest of us, and that's prejudice.
  | There is one problem with Davis' interview, though, and it leaves me in the awkward position of needing to stick up for Dan Snyder. Davis makes the same claim as `Wikipedia <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Snyder#Six_Flags_theme_park>`__:

     Snyder eliminated the popular Mr. Six character from Six Flags commercials :sup:`[citation needed]`

  Citation desperately needed! Snyder bought the park in 2005, and I'm certain I've seen Mr. Six dancing away his bankruptcy worries since then. More importantly, it should go without saying that the character was never popular, and rarely even tolerable.
