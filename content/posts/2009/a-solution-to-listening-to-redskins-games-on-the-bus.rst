Now that the team's season is definitely going to be a disappointment, I've finally figured out the answer to my `radio-listening woes </2009/09/10/making-redskins-radio-usably-portable/>`__.  It's no fancy transcoding or other such nonsense.  It's just a `godawfully ugly site that lists affiliate stations <http://www.freefootballradio.com/Washington.html>`__.  And not just for the Redskins!  Hell, there's even a `similarly-named site for baseball broadcasts <http://www.freebaseballradio.com/mlb.html>`__.  I don't know why these sites don't wind up higher in the Google rankings; they're extremely handy.

After finally stumbling onto this, all it took was some trial and error with the linked URLs and the FStream iPhone app (the stream URLs ending in .pls are good bets).  Handy!
