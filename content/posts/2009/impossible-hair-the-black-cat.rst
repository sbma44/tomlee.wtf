Man! There are few things I like more than getting back from a good show at the Black Cat. Chris suggested we go see his buddy's CD release party, and it was unexpectedly great. With the exception of the City Veins' horn-heavy, guest-star-laden offering, it was probably the best local CD release observation I've attended.

A big part of that was Olivia Mancini, whose opener status continues to perplex me. She's got stage presence, she's got pipes, she can play and, most importantly, she's got the songs to make all of the aforementioned matter. All I can hope is that she's on deck for the next doo-woppy pop/rock slot — between the Pipettes and the Ting Tings it seems like the market can bear one such act every year or two. Olivia certainly deserves that level of... well, if not stardom, then whatever replaced it in the current music industry landscape.

Next up: `The Caribbean <http://dcist.com/2005/11/08/three_stars_the.php>`__. I spent a large part of their set retrieving beer, so I'm probably not in a good position to judge them. What I heard I mostly liked, but I think it's safe to say that they're not really my thing.

Finally there was Impossible Hair. And while they were oversold — if pressed, I would rate their haircuts as merely unlikely — they proved to be an excellent rock band. It was a tight performance filled with really, really good songs. Recommended! Would buy a t-shirt from again. Go see 'em if you have a chance — `looks like <http://www.impossiblehair.com/MPSBL/TOUR.html>`__ your next opportunity closer than Baltimore will be May 13 at Velvet. Unless you're planning a trip to Europe, that is.
