Ryan may be the first non-cyclist in the history of the internet to understand `this dynamic <http://www.ryanavent.com/blog/?p=2202>`__.

**UPDATE:** Ryan informs me that he's not actually a non-cyclist. It turns out that there still has never been a non-bike-owning blogger who has expressed sympathy for or solidarity with cyclists.  Apologies for the error.
