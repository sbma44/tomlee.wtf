Last week `Julian got laid off <http://www.juliansanchez.com/2009/04/02/sic-transit-gloria-conde/>`__, part of a bloodbath at Ars that resulted from the Conde Nast powers-that-be deciding that having excellent, industry-leading online properties didn't fit with their long-term business strategy of making it to retirement without being bothered.

This was pretty disappointing to see, both as a friend and as someone who enjoys reading quality journalism about tech policy. However! Just because he's no longer being paid to cover, say, government wiretapping, doesn't mean that he isn't `making contributions to our cultural discourse <http://www.juliansanchez.com/2009/04/07/solution-to-the-fringe-glyph-cipher/>`__. I can only assume this is what inspired Yglesias to `write this <http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/archives/2009/04/social_production_and_demographic_changes.php>`__.

(Lest anyone think I'm teasing Julian, let me remind you that I'm the same guy who once `meticulously converted the Dharma Initiative logo into a vector graphics format <http://www.zunta.org/blog/archives/2006/05/11/lost_the_plot/>`__ — I'm not a fan of *Fringe*, but being the first to crack its code is pretty cool.)
