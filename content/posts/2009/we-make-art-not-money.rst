On the off chance that you missed it, let me encourage you to go read `Matt's post about our economic shift toward producing wealth that doesn't generate revenue <http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/archives/2009/03/missing_productivity_and_the_rise_of_social_production.php>`__. This is a topic that fascinates me — I've `poked at </2007/10/10/wealth-but-no-wages/>`__ it `before </2007/04/20/giant-nazi-robots/>`__, but of course Matt's take is considerably smarter and more rigorous than any conclusions I've ever reached. His perspective also happens to be cheerier than my own — I remain somewhat pessimistic about the ultimate economic consequences of these changes, even as I find myself looking forward to their effect on our society.

The good news, though, is that I don't actually know anything about economics, so for now let's all just assume that everything will be fine.
