My sincere apologies to all the wonderful people in town for Drupalcon — I realize this is a unique opportunity to see a bunch of great folks who've gone missing from DC. I really do want to catch up with all of you. But right now I'm leaning toward staying in tonight and whimpering pathetically from underneath a blanket. Tomorrow, though, I intend to be hale, hearty & ready to be social.
