The fact that the Wombats haven't yet become a hugely successful band is a persistent puzzlement for me. I've been patient! Ever since the first version of "Backfire at the Disco" I've bided my time, waiting for stateside tour dates and a favorable Pitchfork review. I thought that a much-touted SXSW showcase would do it, but no — I'm still waiting. In the meantime the band has released a number of increasingly overproduced (but still catchy!) singles, and seems to be prepping a new LP.

They also signed with Roadrunner Records, whose `artists page <http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/artists/>`__ is hilarious enough that you really ought to visit it. It's filled with doughy, dour-looking gentleman who front bands with names like Dragonforce and DevilDriver and Nickelback, and who never, ever smile. It is probably the worst collection of bands you've ever seen — except for that one trio of little British fellas, who write catchy pop songs that are smart and fun and pretty much everything you'd want from a cheeky Liverpudlian trio. Bah! Anyway, if you can find `this album <http://www.amazon.com/Girls-Boys-Marsupials-Wombats/dp/B000GMBQ5U/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&s=music&qid=1235160247&sr=8-5>`__ at a non-exorbitant price, you should really think about getting it.
