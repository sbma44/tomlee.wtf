` <http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/archives/2009/08/people-like-the-postal-service.php>`__\ |a_SMASHBOX|\ The Postal Service is dying, and I guess that's sort of sad except for how much `I despise everything about mail <http://www.manifestdensity.net/2007/08/20/admitting-defeat/>`__.

Most of the accounts of paper mail's decline explain it by pointing to the advantages of electronic communication.  And it's true: email and the phone have the edge in terms of both speed and cost.  But most commentators ignore one of their biggest advantages, which is that modern communication mediums outperform the mail by *not being terrible and useless.*

It is, I admit, sometimes pleasant to find an envelope whose little tear-off sides hint that a check is waiting.  But ignoring that specific case for a moment: what does mail do for me?  For the most part, it's nothing more than a string of obligations -- and worse, ones that are hidden within a stream of cynical and dishonest commercial appeals, many of them specifically designed to trick me both by their packaging and their contents (credit monitoring sounds great! and look, the credit card company is sending me checks to use!).

Yet mail can't be ignored, because it's the de facto -- and often de jure -- system for notifying individuals of events that may ultimately have serious legal or financial consequences.  If I've been sending an electronic bill payment to the wrong address, or am supposed to report for jury duty, or forgot to sign my tax return, the mail is the only place that I'll hear about it before the cable stops working or a deputy shows up.

But use of the mail for this vital function has been made more difficult at a steady clip as solicitations have become a bigger and bigger portion of each user's daily haul.  It's gotten to the point where I almost never receive a replacement credit card the first time it's sent to me.  The envelopes that carry such cards are, for obvious reasons, not clearly labeled, and so they wind up torn in half and in the trash.  It isn't until I notice an expired card, call the company and make a mental note to start opening envelopes that the situation is resolved.

The reduction of home delivery to five days per week won't change this, of course, but if it represents a step toward the destruction of the mail as our society's official communication medium, I'm all for it.  Messages about events that could impact my finances or freedom shouldn't be transmitted via a channel that's mostly filled with advertising.  Instead we ought to be using a medium that's legally protected from commercial intrusion -- there are desperately few, but mobile phones come to mind, and cryptographically signed email could work.  Really, almost anything would be better than burying important messages amidst advertisements designed to look like important messages.
