Probably the greatest part of the intersection between the late Sunday Chinatown bus and iPhone ownership is the ability to listen to WAMU's weekly installment of *The Big Broadcast* without any distractions or even alternatives (thanks, non-functioning reading lights!).  Tonight's episode of *Gunsmoke* was particularly strong.  Not because of any particularly great plot twists or character work.  But **man**, that is how you write a death scene.  Also: Matt Dillon makes a compelling case for preventive detention!

I'm pretty sure that this is the same recording of the episode, though admittedly the radio station seems to have some tape hiss-eliminating filters that make the all-important moments of silence actually silent.  Still, worth a listen -- just scour iTunes for the "Dolby B" switch; I'm sure it's in there somewhere.
