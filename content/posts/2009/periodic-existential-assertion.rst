I'm waiting for Windows to finish installing some IE8 debugging software, so perhaps now is a good time to take a breath, open Wordpress and note that *I am not dead*.  I'm just busy.  We're perilously close to a major launch on the Subsidyscope project.  At the same time, Clay's taken a month off to get married (see also: `awww <http://twitpic.com/igdmm>`__), leaving me to mind the store at Sunlight in his absence.  It's flattering and exciting, but hasn't left a lot of time for bloggy diversions.

But to catch you up briefly: I bought a `netbook <http://www.amazon.com/ASUS-1005HA-PU1X-BK-10-1-Inch-Black-Netbook/dp/B002DYIXMI/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=electronics&qid=1253554452&sr=8-1>`__; Emily and I remain enthralled by `Avatar <http://www.manifestdensity.net/2009/08/23/despite-the-following-i-assure-you-that-i-am-an-adult-man/>`__; Halloween preparation is picking up speed\*; I am in perpetually-worse shape; Emily's cat is officially back in Philadelphia as of this morning, and her brother is in DC; and I still can't `reliably listen to the football game <http://www.manifestdensity.net/2009/09/10/making-redskins-radio-usably-portable/>`__ from the bus.

The next month is going to include a bunch of travel (Boston! Vermont!) and hopefully a slight becalming of my work life.  And if that happens, perhaps I'll write more here!  I do miss it, and appreciate those of you who have bothered to keep my humble blog in your RSS reader.

*\** `coffin construction <http://www.manifestdensity.net/2009/09/04/the-next-big-thing-artisanal-coffin-production/>`__ *is going well, I have multiple agents investigating sources of animal skulls, and when I leave to pick up lunch in a moment I'm going to see if the corner florist can't be cajoled into giving me a good rate on dead flowers*
