This `Iran proxy network thingy <http://haystacknetwork.com/>`__ seems deeply suspicious to me. A tech journalist friend seems to think it's legit, and I suppose I'll admit that it's too early to say. But I have a lot of questions:

- Why, when demand for your service will vary with global political events, would you `buy servers <http://blog.austinheap.com/haystack-gets-a-dell-dude/>`__ instead of leasing them or using a scalable VPS setup?
- How is having a monolithic server installation in a datacenter consistent with avoiding ISP-level blocking by the government? How can this project succeed if the government just decides to block all encrypted traffic?
- Why is there no discussion on the `project website <http://haystacknetwork.com/>`__ of the technical approach being used? Are the developers familiar with the architecture and history of the `Freenet <http://freenetproject.org/>`__ project, or `Tor <http://tor.eff.org>`__? What are their technical credentials, anyway, other than having read the `Squid docs <http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/>`__?
- Why isn't the app open source, or even just released? If the answer is "security through obscurity", how long do the developers expect that tactic to work?
- Why have the organizers been hitting people up for money ever since the `first press release <http://www.prnine.com/releases-002834/iran/haystack-developers-announce-successful-test-plants-program-handful-iranians.html>`__?
- And, most pressingly: what could possibly possess someone to unsarcastically describe himself by uttering the phrase, "`I have always been a man of principle <http://www.prnine.com/releases-002816/iran/haystack-program-providing-unfiltered-internet-access-iran-released.html>`__"?
