`This <http://voices.washingtonpost.com/ezra-klein/2009/10/dc_booze.html>`__ drives me nuts. Not that drink prices in D.C. are so high, per se -- that's fine, businesses should charge what they can for alcohol. But the brazenness of it sometimes gets to me.  Don't put a goddamn placard out on the street proudly advertising your $4 domestic bottle happy hour special.  Don't `charge me <http://www.cremedc.com/index.html>`__ $7 for a Yuengling. Gussy it up! Hide the gouging!  When you fail to do so, it's sort of insulting.
