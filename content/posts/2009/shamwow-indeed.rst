Look, I don't know what `you <http://pygmalioninablanket.blogspot.com/2009/01/guess-whos-back-to-work-thats-right-you.html>`__ `guys <http://blogstretch.blogspot.com/>`__ have against Vince or `ShamWow <https://www.shamwow.com/ver4/index.asp>`__, the revolutionary new absorption concept that is sweeping — well, if not the nation, then at least the parts of it that watch TBS at 1am. But this mean-spiritedness has got to stop. Yes, it's clear that Vince had been awake for at least 50 hours when that commercial was filmed. And yes, he is an `ex-Scientologist who sued Anna Nicole Smith for breach of contract <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vince_Offer>`__ in relation to his failed gross-out comedy movie (the New York Times called it "`a monument to ineptitude and self-delusion <http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9805EFDF1F31F93BA15756C0A96F958260&scp=1&sq=underground+comedy+movie&st=nyt>`__").

But what's the alternative? This is a subject that Charles, Emily and I have discussed at length. Vince may not be perfect — he's just a human being, as flawed and beautiful as any of us — but at least he has the guts to stand up to Billy Mays and the grasping tentacles of his infomercial syndicate.

Now, I'll be the first to acknowledge Mr. Mays' impressive achievements. But his time has passed; it's clear that these days, his heart's not in it. Worse, his `Zorbeez project <http://www.asseenontvvideo.com/487/Zorbeez.html>`__ is a transparent attempt to destroy Vince and the ShamWow, no matter the cost (how else can one explain his proffer of a $60 value for a mere $14.99?!). Doesn't America deserve a fresh new face to sell us oddly-shaped cooking implements and citrus-based cleaning products? Can we really sanction the sort of anticompetitive behavior that Mr. Mays represents?

I say yes! And no! Respectively! Vince may not deserve your love, but when, every night, his shaking hands remove that headset — in that moment he at least deserves your respect. And your order, of course. Call now.
