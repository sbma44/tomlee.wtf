Small complaints that I will file here instead of on Twitter:

- Installing MS Office 2008 seems to have affected the default line height of text on this blog when viewed in my browser. I know, you think I'm imagining it — but consider the fact that all text disappeared from the browser during the installation process (and only came back when I restarted Firefox). Weird, right?

- Russian dressing seems to me to just be a flimsy attempt to approximate cheese while keeping reuben sandwiches kosher. This is understandable, but we shouldn't let cultural traditions that are relevant for only a small subset of the population hold the rest of us back from scientific progression in the field of sandwiches.

     </p>

  (It's true, of course, that you can find non-kosher reubens, but I still feel that the historical burden of religion has prevented the quest for a superior reuben condiment from receiving the attention it deserves.)
