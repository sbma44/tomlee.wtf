It's too late for you now, you poor suckers, but you should be sorry if you missed `Spencer <http://attackerman.firedoglake.com>`__'s virtuoso performance at Transformer last night. *Iron Man vs. the Imperialists* expanded on his `Prospect essay of the same name <http://www.prospect.org/cs/articles?article=iron_man_vs_the_imperialists>`__, and managed to not only make me feel self-conscious about my pathetic knowledge of 20th century American history — which is perfectly normal, and something that happens pretty much any time someone mentions a historical event not explicitly depicted in a *Simpsons* episode — but also made me feel self-conscious about my limited knowledge of comic books, which is not something that usually happens in places that aren't the internet.

But I didn't mind, because Spencer was engaging, funny and had an interesting argument to make. And, more importantly, I didn't mind because it's inspiring to see a friend deploy an impressive set of skills toward a whimsical end.

On that note: I can't boast any impressive skills myself other than wide-ranging dilettantism, but my co-presenter on Saturday `certainly can <http://selforganizingsystem.org/images/sculpture-magazine_April-2008.pdf>`__ (PDF). So come see us tomorrow at Transformer Gallery and learn a thing or two about microcontrollers and why they're about to escape the realm of geekery and enter into the mainstream hobbiest's arsenal. 2pm, on the same block as Whole Foods.
