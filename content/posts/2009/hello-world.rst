I should really have gone to bed a while ago, but I just couldn't stand it any longer.  Movable Type.  Oh, Movable Type.  I stood by you for so long.  But Perl is a wasteland.  And now, having spent a vast amount of time recompiling Apache *just to export my archives*, I know I made the right decision.

Besides, I've been feeling the blogging itch lately -- Twitter ceases to satisfy -- so I figured I may as well try to facilitate my dreams of writing more frequently.  Wordpress is just much, much nicer these days.

I apologize for how much crap is probably broken.  I know the front page works all right (except for the Twitter feed), and permalinks should redirect, but that's about it.  I'll have a closer look when I've got a sec, but if, in the meantime, you discover any weirdness, please do feel free to leave me a comment to that effect.  Assuming the comments work.
