I've accidentally run current backward through some delicate electronics, gone through a staggering number of voltage regulators and flat-out melted a solenoid, but my Artomatic project seems to be working! There is, of course, still a chance that some hardware aspect of the thing will fail. Or that there's a hidden software bug that will prevent it from rebooting on schedule. Or that I'll screw something up when I try to move the log files to a nonvolatile disk location. But for now I'm feeling pretty good about it! If you're by the Navy Yard Metro in the next month, you should drop by, see some art and ring some bells.

The Artomatic website makes it unfortunately difficult to find when the damn event will actually be open. But the info can be found in `this press release <http://artomatic.org/node/4976>`__. The key details:

   | May 29 – July 5, 2009
   | Wednesdays and Thursdays, 5 p.m. â€“ 10 p.m.
   | Fridays and Saturdays, 12 noon â€“ 1 a.m.
   | Sundays, 12 noon â€“ 10 p.m.
   | closed Mondays and Tuesdays.

You can find a map of the location `here <http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=CSWJHjvshw4KFdc0UQIdn_do-yFJ05RY2kIyxA&q=artomatic&sll=38.881137,-77.0065&sspn=0.011075,0.023797&gl=us&ie=UTF8&ei=bEIUStDsEJ-wiwOsxuT_Aw&cd=3&cid=38876394,-77006946,13824474862365011346&li=lmd&ll=38.878272,-77.00695&spn=0.011075,0.023797&z=16&iwloc=A>`__ — Artomatic is in the same building as the Navy Yard Metro entrance that's closest to the ballpark. My piece is on the fourth floor.

**OH YEAH:** For those interested, the project's software is `all on GitHub <http://github.com/sbma44/artomatic/tree/master>`__. If you're wandering in from Google in an effort to figure out how to get Python working on the Fonera with serial and network capabilities, this would be a good place to start.
