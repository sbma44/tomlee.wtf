I had this naive hope that actually if you got rid of almost all the MBAs and kept things small and the writers owned the enterprise, there'd be enough of a business left that we, the audience, wouldn't have to sit through all of the same stupid bullshit that's ruined the rest of the internet.  But no: this seemingly-insignificant "feature" is fractal, and if you zoom far enough out the picture you'll see is of a guy handing a receptive Alex Balk a business card with "SEO" printed on it somewher.

Now I see how foolish I was being, and now I know the truth: the truly transformative blog can only exist if it's based out of a utopian seasteading community.  But then it'll be perfect.
