While the wort was boiling I put together a couple more Boarduino kits that I had hanging around, and tonight I messed around with them a bit more. I already had the breadboard set up with the shift registers and LEDs — not that you can see them, of course (thanks YouTube!).

Tonight I made a pinwheel, then hooked it up to a DC motor and used the combination as a more expensive, less accurate, potentially chip-destroying rotary encoder. It's pretty janky, in other words. But I had this motor on hand (scrounged it from a CDROM), and Radioshack doesn't stock rotary encoders. Besides, some safety checking with the multimeter implies that it'd have to be a *very* strong wind to fry the chip.

Anyway, all of this was in service of Summer Camp, a series of talks and events at `Transformer <http://www.transformergallery.org/>`__ that launched this Saturday and which will be going on through the first week of March. Marissa was kind enough to invite me to talk about the Arduino, and `Alberto <http://selforganizingsystem.org/>`__ is generously sharing a stage with me, which I find pretty exciting. Anyway, mark your calendars: Saturday, February 28! You should check out the rest of the `Summer Camp schedule (PDF) <http://www.transformergallery.org/pdfs/Transformer-Summer.Camp.schedule.pdf>`__, too, of course — there's a lot of cool stuff going on.
