They say that music gets worse under Democratic administrations.  Given the particular excitement surrounding Barack Obama's election, we may be in for an especially dismal musical interlude.  Don't believe me?  Consider: `Limp Bizkit announced their reunion <http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/news/limp-bizkit-reuniting-for-tour-album-1003941036.story#/bbcom/news/limp-bizkit-reuniting-for-tour-album-1003941036.story>`__ twenty days after Obama's inauguration.  Worse, Wikipedia reveals that `the initial incarnation of the band ended in September 2001 <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limp_bizkit#Borland.27s_first_departure>`__, the exact point at which the Bush presidency shifted modes from "Gump" to "Childers".

It's not just the one band, of course.  `You can't tell me that this is at all encouraging <http://www.npr.org/blogs/allsongs/2009/07/poll_results_best_of_the_year.html>`__.

On the upside, I seem to have picked a good time to become too old to engage with pop culture.
