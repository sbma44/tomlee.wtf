`Tim Lee has a new blog <http://timothyblee.com/>`__.  You should read it!  Tim's one of the smartest thinkers-about-technology that I know.  But I have less and less time for RSS these days, and one of the worst consequences has been an inability to keep track of what he's been writing about, spread as it was among a number of group blogs.  I'm excited to have him publishing in a single place, at least for a while.

(Though he really shouldn't declare thin clients a historical loser -- like any hardware-loving geek I tend to come down on the fat client side of the debate, but what is the tech press's beloved cloud computing other than thin client computing with HTML instead of X?).
