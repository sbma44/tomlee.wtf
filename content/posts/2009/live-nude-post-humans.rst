I haven't seen *Watchmen* yet — Emily and I were traveling last night, bound for a quick vacation in Texas. Just about the time everyone else was suffering through "`Citizen Solder <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJRthpxDM10>`__" I was tucking into an enormous plate of `delicious blue corn tortillas <http://www.chuys.com/location.html>`__. So I say this based on the comic, not the film.

But of course `Phoebe's right <http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/tapped_archive?month=03&year=2009&base_name=in_defense_of_the_penis>`__ that there's a double standard when it comes to female and male nudity in films, and our discomfort at either is a bit silly. *Watchmen* seems like an odd time to make that case, though, because here the nudity is used precisely **because** we're uncomfortable with it. Dr. Manhattan wanders around naked, and that seems odd to us. But it doesn't seem odd to him because he's a superbeing that's almost completely alienated from humanity. To him a body is a construct, and it's impossible to understand the social conventions surrounding it or anything else. If the audience was similarly blasé about Dr. M striding about in his deathday suit there wouldn't be any point to showing him doing so.
