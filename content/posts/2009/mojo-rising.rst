I'm a day late, but still want to congratulate the folks at EchoDitto and the MJ web team for successfully launching the new `Mother Jones.com <http://www.motherjones.com>`__. I worked on the new MoJo site for my last few months at `EchoDitto <http://www.echoditto.com>`__, and leaving the project incomplete was one of the major qualms I had about leaving — I got to work with a lot of cool clients at ED, but it's hard to think of one I was happier about than Mother Jones. I know it's been an at-times painful process (it always is), but it's great to see what I left behind turned into the new site.
