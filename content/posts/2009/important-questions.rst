Emily and I both read and enjoyed *World War Z* at the beach. Emily enjoyed it enough to ask that *The Zombie Survival Guide* be included among her birthday loot, and it was probably the spirit of that book that led us to discuss the technical specifics of vampire abatement strategies.

Unfortunately, no consensus could be reached, so it falls to you, internet, to weigh in on the feasibility of killing a vampire by driving one of the following objects through its heart:

#. Painted wood (latex/oil/lacquer (e.g. a pool cue))
#. Particle board
#. Frozen sawdust and water (`see also <http://dsc.discovery.com/fansites/mythbusters/articles/what-is-pykrete.html>`__)
#. A cone of tightly-wrapped paper

Posit that sufficient force is available to overcome problems related to each material's sharpness — we are killing these vampires in a laboratory setting, and for the sake of this argument can safely dismiss practical concerns.

Emily felt strongly that the wood's semantic status was the primary factor at work, leaving her convinced that option one was the only viable method of disposing of the undead. I disagree completely: I think there must be a chemical mechanism at work, which leads me to expect that methods two and three would unquestionably work, and that method four stands a good chance as well. But I have grave concerns about the use of laminated wood, and frankly am surprised that more vampire fiction doesn't make use of actually-that-stake-was-painted-now-I'm-going-to-bite-you-(SURPRISE!) trope that it makes possible.

What say you, internet? Remember to show your work.
