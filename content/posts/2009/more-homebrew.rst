I've been a little worn down all day. Yesterday `Kriston <http://www.grammarpolice.net>`__ and I set out to begin a batch of homebrewed wheat beer. But we did a bad job of estimating times and got a late start, and the result was a brewing operation that lasted until 3AM.

It seems to have gone fine, though. It wasn't yet bubbling by the time I left for work, but of course that was only a horrifically small number of hours since it went into the fermenter. By the time I got home from work it was bubbling away happily:

This is a marked improvement from my `last brewing attempt <http://internetfoodassociation.com/2009/02/09/even-more-unwanted-foam/>`__, which spewed foam all over the goddamn place. This time the friendly folks at the Philly homebrew store gave me some Belgian Wyeast liquid yeast, and it seems to be a bit better behaved than True Brew's relatively vigorous stuff.
