I didn't go downtown this morning. Getting anywhere even potentially worth being seemed to require a very early start, and although `Becks <http://www.unfogged.com>`__' promise of a delicious pre-inaugural spread was tempting, I opted out. I'd gotten up before dawn the day before in order to catch a flight, making me even less inclined than normal to wake up early. Instead I woke up around 10, made some coffee and french toast, then plopped down in front of the TV. Honestly, I think this was the way to go.

I did head out on my bike around 1, though, to see what things were like around town. I made a rough circle down to Chinatown, over to Freedom Plaza, up Fourteenth, across U, then back down Eleventh. The verdict: there are a lot of people here! They all seem excited to bustle about and enjoy the historic occasion, but there's no comparison to `the emotion that flooded the streets on election night </2008/11/05/between-the-click-of-the-light-and-the-start-of-the-dream/>`__. I guess for that sort of joyousness to spread to the daylight hours we'd need to be transitioning from an even worse president than Bush to an even more trailblazing and exciting one than Obama. Like, say, a resurrected Freddie Mercury succeeding a two-term Palpatine administration. Well, fingers crossed!

You'll be glad to know that I took some crappy pictures with my iphone:

Gallery Place was ground zero for nonsensical Obama paraphernalia, including this plumber's truck with photos of the new president plastered on it. Despite the street being closed, a cop yelled at me for stopping my bike to take this photo, and then again when I took five seconds to begin moving. Ah, officiousness.

|Fourteenth Street|

Fourteenth had stalls set up, but aside from folks queued to get into the perimeter around the mall, it wasn't too flooded with people. It was pretty fun to bike through the closed streets.

There's an Obama ice sculpture outside of Ben's. And yeah, the line still goes down the alley:

MOST EXCITINGLY: I'm pretty sure I saw Matthew Lesko walking down my street as I returned home. I mean, okay, it could have been someone else. But whoever it was, he was wearing a leather jacket emblazoned with question marks, pants with question marks on the back pocket, a question mark hat, and ludicrous shoes (which seem likely to have also involved punctuation symbols of one sort or another).
