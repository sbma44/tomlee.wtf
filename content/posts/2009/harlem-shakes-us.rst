Like `Amanda said <http://blogstretch.blogspot.com/2009/04/well.html>`__, the Harlem Shakes show is unfortunately cancelled. That's too bad; I sent the band an email saying I hoped to have a chance to see them soon, and a note to DC9 saying I hoped to see my money again, ever. To date, both remain unanswered.

I think this tips the karmic scales in favor of sharing an MP3, don't you? So here, have a listen to "Strictly Game". This may not be the best track for hooking people — "`Sunlight <http://hypem.com/search/harlem+shakes+sunlight/1/>`__" is pretty clearly the catchiest, danciest thing on the record — but it's the track I'm currently most enamored with. But hey, they're all pretty good — the title track's the only one I'm lukewarm on.

And don't miss Amanda's concert-grief-counseling strategy — that Pomegranates track she posted is awfully good, even if naming your band after the world's most overhyped fruit is practically begging for dismissive reviews.
