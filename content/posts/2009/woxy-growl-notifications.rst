A while ago I pestered the author of the `WOXY playlist widget <http://www.uhlenbrock.us/woxy/>`__ to add Growl support — I like to be able to learn what I'm listening to without opening my web browser — and he was nice enough to do so. That worked okay for a while, but I think the widget's no longer being maintained; at the very least my copy now seems to be broken.

But two things have changed, making the kludginess of a widget unnecessary. First, a few months ago `WOXY began offering a 128kbps MP3 stream <http://woxy.com/stream/mpg128.pls>`__, providing listenable sound quality without the use of their iTunes-unfriendly AACPlus stream. Second, it appears that last month `some nice fellow on the internet <http://www.dolejsky.com/2009/02/19/growltunes-patch/>`__ patched the GrowlTunes helper app so that it actually shows notifications properly when there's a track change in a radio stream being played by iTunes. Thanks, stranger!
