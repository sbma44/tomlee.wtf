Gag me with a spoon from some little hole in the wall after-hours place in the LES that was supposed to just serve falafel but actually it started to have these awful high school bands sometimes and if you knew the guy he'd sell you big paper cups of Turkish beer and when I tell people this story now I usually say it turned into a Hot Topic because that's funnier but actually I just started hating how young everyone there seemed to be.

Oh! Before I forget, I hope you'll join me for my own symposium: "What was the feckless D.C.-based web developer who complains too much?" I mean can you *believe* those guys? So lame! Anyway, details to follow.
