Just a heads-up to any DC area geeks who might be strolling by this blog: we're `still looking for good people <http://sunlightlabs.com/blog/2009/03/06/hiring-developers-help-open-government/>`__ to come work for the `Sunlight Foundation <http://sunlightfoundation.com>`__. It's a fun place to work, and jobs in the labs are that rarest of opportunities: a chance to use your technical skills for the good of (non-Azerothian) society. Python and Ruby people are especially welcome. Go, apply!
