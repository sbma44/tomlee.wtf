I have not been having good bicycle luck. Since Friday I've ruptured five innertubes and had two tire levers snap. The flats have forced me to walk through the cold, then the rain, then the cold again; I've had to skip appointments and be late to work and walk in bad shoes until my feet ache. My fingers are suffused with brake dust; my hands look like they belong to a Pompeiian mummy.

And yet! I am now *so much faster* at changing tires, and this feeling of accomplishment almost makes up for all of the hassle. The operation requires finesse, see, and you tend to accidentally hurt yourself and waste time and materials when you're still getting the hang of it. But now I have the hang of it! I don't do those things anymore! It's great!

Well, alright, I'm still wasting materials at a phenomenal clip. But there's a reliable and thoroughly pleasant honeymoon period of about forty minutes before the newly-installed innertube explodes, and that's enough for basking. Tomorrow the offending rim goes back to the bike shop and people who objectively know what they're doing; for now, for me, the subjective experience is going to have to be sufficient.
