|do you think he wears a cape?|\ It's great that `this guy <http://www.tucsonbikelawyer.com/>`__ is specializing in cases from cyclists who've been in accidents. But it isn't really necessary. Believe me: if you get a police report filed about your accident (and of course you should — nothing makes an insurance agent happier), personal injury scumbags will wriggle out of the woodwork and plop themselves onto your voicemail almost immediately. When it happened to me I found it pretty annoying, but I suppose it's nice to know that cyclists' rights will be protected.

But a legal jihad against drivers won't change anything. At this point I'm convinced that the only way to make cities bike-friendly is to put fellow travelers (so to speak) into positions of power, `like they've done in NYC <http://nymag.com/news/features/56794/>`__.
