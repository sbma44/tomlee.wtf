Ryan `disagrees <http://www.ryanavent.com/blog/?p=662>`__ with my Christmas rock boosterism. I'll just go ahead and quote the whole post:

   | I have to tell you guys, I am not a fan of Christmas rock songs and/or modern interpretations of old Christmas stand-bys. Why is this? I donâ€™t know. Pretty much the only departure from Burl Ivesâ€™ old school standards Iâ€™ll tolerate (love actually) is Vince Guaraldiâ€™s Charlie Brown Christmas soundtrack. Although I do like the Velvet Fog doing â€œA Christmas Song.â€?
   | This may have something to do with a deep sense that Christmas is actually a celebration of the past more than anything elseâ€“not something to be modernized. Or it could just be the long, looooong list of abominations resulting from contemporary acts doing Christmas songs.

Naturally, I feel differently. To me the Christmas standards don't feel so much classic as they do dated. They were a part of my childhood, so of course I enjoy listening to them for the sake of nostalgia. But I think that it's wrong to consider them as the ur-Christmas songs. "Holly Jolly Christmas", "Winter Wonderland", "Rudolph" — *those* were the songs that constituted a departure from the past, as song & dance men cranked out superficial, secular story-songs in tandem with the rise of the Christmas-Industrial complex.

In some ways I think the best of the new songs actually harken back to the pre-ditty era of Christmas music. Not because they're reconnecting with the holiday's religious aspect, but because the songs are able to tap into a pool of surprisingly universal experience. With partial apologies to my Jewish friends, there are plenty of emotionally resonant aspects to this time of year that we've all felt: wintery quiet, loneliness, warmth, grandeur, joy. I won't sit here and pretend that *Maybe This Christmas XXIV* brings tears to my eyes, but it's likely to be a hell of a lot more artistically successful than a song about a magical snowman.
