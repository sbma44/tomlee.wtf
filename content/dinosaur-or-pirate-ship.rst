Tonight we play miniature golf. This has been on the beach-agenda every year, but this year's staying-the-whole-week innovation makes it look like it's finally going to happen. I'm pretty excited; I consider mini-golf to be an important part of the beach experience.

Still, there is a looming question that must be answered before we can take to the astroturf and do battle:

*Dinosaur or Pirate Ship?*

Don't mistake zaniness for a lack of profundity. This isn't just about which family fun center would make for the better putt-putt experience. This is about what society and human fellowship mean to you — what you hope they could mean.

*Dinosaur or Pirate Ship?*

Keep saying it until it's almost a zen koan. Dinosaur or Pirate Ship? There may not be an answer, but this does not excuse you from seeking one.

*Dinosaur or Pirate Ship.*

**UPDATE:** Pirate Ship.
