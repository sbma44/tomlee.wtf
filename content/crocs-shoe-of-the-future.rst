Seriously: try it; you'll like it. Toe protection! Ventilation! `Drainage <http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/scupper>`__! I'll come right out and say it: for drunkenly floating down a river in an innertube, there can be no superior footwear. I'm even beginning to think the navy ones look halfway dignified. I'll be keeping my eye on `crocs.com <http://www.crocs.com/>`__ for a "formal" menu item.

(The extent to which they horrify friends and loved ones is pretty enjoyable, too.)
