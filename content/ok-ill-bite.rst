`The G asks for music recommendations <http://pygmalioninablanket.blogspot.com/2009/02/halp.html>`__. I can oblige! Remember how I `bitched about 2008's crop of music <http://www.manifestdensity.net/2008/12/16/music_in_the_year_of_the_rat/>`__? And how I closed by saying "but there are a bunch of things I haven't listened to; maybe they'll be better"? Well, I listened to a few of them, and they've all been fantastic. Here are some albums I should've paid attention to earlier, and a few that I've been paying attention to recently:

No Age (too cool for skool, but in a pleasant way); Glasvegas (awesomely overwhelming, and prompted me to finally listen to *Lust Lust Lust* for a full-on fuzz-fest); Gaslight Anthem (actually as good as Spencer says); Titus Andronicus (wears thin by the end, but awfully energetic). And as I mentioned, the new Dan Deacon has leaked and is fantastic — better than *Spiderman of the Rings*, I think. Although I should preface this observation by noting that my knowledge of classical music is more or less limited to the soundtrack for Beef Council commercials, I will go so far as to say that *Bromst* sounds Coplandesque to me in a lot of places.

Oh! Also, Julian says that Pains of Being Pure at Heart are good, and the couple of songs I heard at his place bore that judgment out.

Not recommended: Andrew Bird, Animal Collective. Neither are bad (although Bird's a bit boring, which is disappointing given how wowed I've been by the handful of live TV performances of his that I've seen), but neither really did it for me, either. Admittedly, my lukewarm feelings for the AC album may have something to do with the displaced rage that its title elicits.

**OH YEAH:** Speaking of music, `this Diplo interview <http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/148739-guest-list-diplo>`__ is pretty funny.
