I didn't dig far into the surrounding context when I wrote about `buying fake tags <https://tomlee.wtf/2023/02/03/fake-tags-are-a-real-problem/>`__, but I saw plenty of surprised reactions on social media to this obvious criminality on Facebook Marketplace. The situation is well understood, but pretty far from resolved.

I recommend these articles from CNBC and NBC News:

- `Stolen goods sold on Amazon, eBay and Facebook are causing havoc for major retailers <https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/17/the-fight-against-stolen-products-on-amazon-and-facebook-marketplace.html>`__
- `'It’s an easy fast dollar': How organized retail theft rings in one Ohio town use Facebook Marketplace to sell stolen goods <https://www.nbcnews.com/news/crime-courts/organized-shoplifting-rings-work-police-one-ohio-town-are-fighting-bac-rcna9802>`__

The second story highlights law enforcement's sense that of the various online marketplaces, Facebook is particularly unhelpful when they make a request.

There's also relevant legislation: `the INFORM Act <https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/936>`__ would require sellers who are doing meaningful volumes of business to pass through additional identity verification processes. It passed the House, but I'm unsure whether anyone considers it a priority in the new Congress. `Retail industry groups are pushing for it <https://rilastagemedia.blob.core.windows.net/rila-web/rila.web/media/media/pdfs/letters%20to%20hill/2021/ceo-inform-consumers-act-final1.pdf>`__, though, with the online marketplaces standing on the other side of the issue.

This wouldn't be a panacea. As the NBC story notes, theft rings recruit can still legitimate front-people to go through verification processes. And for something like fake tags, it seems like sellers could easily set up a new account whenever they approach INFORM's $5,000 revenue threshold for verification. Still, it's a step in the right direction, as is `the multi-state task force convened by attorneys general who are interested in this problem <https://illinoisattorneygeneral.gov/pressroom/2021_12/20211203.html>`__.

Lots more to be done here, but some people are paying attention. Whether that includes anyone in D.C., I couldn't say...
