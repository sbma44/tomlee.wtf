Having been reminded to do so by `this <http://www.unfogged.com/archives/week_2008_06_29.html#008959>`__, I've got a question:

Which is the more ridiculous yuppie beverage fad: `cold-brewed coffee <http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/27/dining/27coff.html?_r=1&oref=login>`__ or `kombucha <http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9900E3D8143BF93BA15751C1A962958260>`__, the fermented tea product?

Recently I've been drinking a lot of one of them (but of course it would be spoiling things to say which). Remember to show your work.
