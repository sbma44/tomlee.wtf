Yesterday I read Brian Doherty `claiming <http://www.reason.com/blog/show/122765.html>`__ that Radiohead's pay-what-you-want scheme for their new album would undercut piracy and thought "Not so fast!" In my experience folks will upload any content that's even marginally relevant to a site. I've certainly seem freely-available content redistributed through pirate channels before.

|maybe they HAVE beaten the pirates|

But in this case he may actually be right. Oink doesn't have it, although I suppose that makes some sense given that downloading an album from Oink comes at a cost (users have to maintain an upload/download ratio to keep their access to the site). But Isohunt hasn't got *In Rainbows* either. Huh.

**UPDATE:** `Rich <http://strangebirdlabs.com/>`__ pointed out in comments that the band's preselling the downloads, but that nobody's actually got the files yet. That makes sense, and I feel dumb for not realizing that was how the whole thing was supposed to work. So: torrents in t-minus eight days!
