`This <http://badnewshughes.blogspot.com/2007/04/diary-of-things-that-are-awesome.html>`__ really, really makes me want to see the Flaming Lips again. You might look at these pictures (particularly the ones near the bottom) and think that it was a special performance for an unusually large festival show. Nope. It all looks pretty much like what they did when I saw 'em at 9:30.
