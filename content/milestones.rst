At my last job, everyone was an architect. Software architects, information architects, perhaps solution architects -- I don't remember all of them, to be honest. It was a little silly, but also kind of sweet: it reflected a desire to treat everyone at the firm in an equal way, and was an effort to recognize each person's creative contribution. When I left I was both a little bit relieved and a little bit sad to lost my nominal architect status.
