Let's not leave things on a down note. You know what I haven't posted yet? Photos of California. So here they are — the best ones, anyway. The full set of at-least-vaguely-redeemable photos can be found `here <http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/sets/72157600030591614/>`__.

I wish I'd taken more shots of my friends, any of my relatives, and fewer pitcures of natural splendor — pictures of the first two are usually pretty fun, and pictures of the latter are usually kind of a letdown next to the real thing. But there are a few decent pics in there that at least hint at how astoundingly beautiful `Point Reyes <http://www.nps.gov/pore/>`__ is.

But of course the highlight of the trip wasn't any of the touristy crap, but rather just getting the chance to see folks I hadn't in a while. It was really good to meet up with `Jon <http://www.mp3.com/users/Jon47/profile.php>`__, `Jeff <http://www.jeffnye.org>`__, Marie and Paul, and to meet Paul's girlfriend. And seeing Noree, Ron, Jeb and Mimi was wonderful. I really can't thank Jeff & Marie and Noree & Ron enough for putting us up. Berkeley is a pretty great location for a California vacation home base, it turns out. Not only because it's walkable and close to the BART, but also because `co-op pizza <http://www.yelp.com/biz/8xJosknJdcPGPUQ4Pod99w>`__ is GREAT pizza. You can really taste the collectivism — delicious, delicious collectivism.
