Alright internet, I need theories. We have a problem at work: it's our dishwasher. It's a relatively recent acquisition — one of those miniature units that feel dainty and ridiculous, but which are quite useful for taming the tower of coffee mugs and soiled tupperware that would otherwise teeter over the sink. For that, it's great.

The problem is that it smells. Not while operating, but when its wash cycle is complete, everything inside of it is suffused with a sickening floral scent. Not *really* floral, mind you — I mean bad fake floral, and with a distinct note of machine oil underneath it. It's pretty unpleasant. I've had to throw out more than one serving of food after forgetting to re-rinse the container I put it in. I once found my eyes watering from it as I tried to eat a mug full of oatmeal.

I thought it was the fancy-pants detergent capsules we were using, but after switching brands that suspect has been ruled out. The smell persists.

So here's the mystery: what the hell could it be? And how do I get rid of it?

Oh, and a dead body was found next to the dishwasher in a puddle of water BUT THE ROOM WAS LOCKED. But I don't think that's necessarily related.
