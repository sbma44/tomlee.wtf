Don't miss `Jason's annual commentary <http://dceiver.blogspot.com/2008/07/highlights-from-hill-hotties-2008.html>`__ on the `Hill Hotties list <http://hill6.thehill.com/cover-stories/50-most-beautiful-people-on-capitol-hill-2008---top-10-2008-07-29.html>`__. My favorite line:

   "Rep. Gresham Barrett (R-S.C.) is proof positive that a high school quarterback can marry his cheerleader girlfriend and live happily ever after." Phew! Glad that's been proven! It's certainly an improvement over the quarterback who was proof positive that being a fake cowboy moron could only take you so far if you were a crypto-racist goon (George Allen).

Other highlights:

- Andrew Savage: I totally know that guy. He's good friends with `Michael <http://silbatron.com>`__. I can't say I've ever seen him make any furniture, but I suppose he could have slipped off to cut decorative scrollwork while I was in the bathroom at St. Ex.
- Check out Otto Mucklo, then try to tell me with a straight face that you believe the bio when it says he's not German. Otto! C'mon!
