`Sunlight Labs <http://sunlightlabs.com/>`__ has been running its now-annual `Apps for America contest <http://sunlightlabs.com/appsforamerica/>`__, and this morning I've been paging through a bunch of the entries. There's some pretty cool stuff! I haven't made it all the way through the 40-some submissions — and frankly, I'm just trying to orient myself, not delve into the apps with attention to make solid judgments about which ones are worthwhile (this is where you notice that the views expressed here have no bearing on the contest or its judging, are not representative of my eployer, are completely misinformed, etc.). But I feel like pointing out two entries in particular.

First, `Buddy <http://geekybuddha.org/buddy/>`__, partly because I have a soft spot for chatbots but mostly because I find the robotic logo both adorable and terrifying.

And second, there's `Filibusted <http://filibusted.us/>`__, which my filibuster-hating friends may find interesting, or at least encouraging.

But do check out `the rest of the entries <http://sunlightlabs.com/appsforamerica/apps/>`__ — there's some really good stuff in there. Although I should probably warn my fellow D.C. residents that repeatedly stopping yourself from entering your own zip code when searching for information about congressional representation is kind of depressing.
