For some reason I perpetually forget about the existence of `IronGeek.com <http://irongeek.com>`__ except for a couple of times every year when it rises, Brigadoon-style, to the level of consciousness. I wish that weren't the case; there's a lot of great stuff on the site. Anyone interested but not well-versed in the security field (i.e. hacking) would do well to check it out.

The most recent bit of interestingness is `this video explanation of DNS spoofing via Ettercap ARP poisoning <http://www.irongeek.com/i.php?page=videos/dns-spoofing-with-ettercap-pharming>`__. For some reason I had gotten it into my head that ARP poisoning only worked on wired ethernet networks. But it seems that's not the case, opening up a great deal of potential for hilarious coffeeshop mischief.
