I just changed the filters on my Etymotic headphones for the first time.  It's been years since I got them, and I'm an idiot for not doing it sooner.  I had honestly forgotten that these things -- anything, really -- could sound this good. I thought I was just getting hopelessly old.

If you own a pair of these earphones, and have owned them for a while, `go buy some replacement filters <http://www.etymotic.com/ephp/er6i-acc.aspx>`__.  I didn't believe the manual when I read it, either, but this actually does make a huge difference.  Wow.
