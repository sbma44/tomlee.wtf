Oh right: back from Georgia, only sort of jetlagged, back up to speed shortly. It was great! But let me share one useful lesson learned on my trip: guys, when flying, wear a jacket.

I wore a jacket on my way out; on my way back, I opted for a frumpier but more practical fleece. The difference in how I was treated by the airline staff was astounding. No `offered upgrades to business class <http://www.manifestdensity.net/2010/03/24/they-call-it-wien-which-i-am-still-immature-enough-to-find-hilarious/>`__ on the trip back; in fact, they wouldn't even let me hang up my garment bag -- not because there wasn't space, but because I was flying coach. This was not a problem on the way out.

On the other hand, I'm not going to back down from the idea that wearing dress shoes for 36 hours of travel is a terrible idea. "Hip but important internet guy": I think that's the sweet spot I want.
