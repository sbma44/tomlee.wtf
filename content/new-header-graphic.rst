| I still haven't gotten around to fixing the archives or comment preview form or a bunch of other things. But I did write a semi-ridiculous script that automatically assembles the header graphic (in multiple resolutions!) very easily. All I've got to do is upload a photo to my photostream, tag it as "blogheader" and run a password-protected script. It's kind of slick, if I do say so myself (although I have to admit that, judging by the aspect ratio of this shot, I think some of my image-resizing math is probably a little screwed up).
| I'd post the code, but it's a pain in the ass to install the PEAR libraries that are necessary for talking to Flickr. If anyone's willing to jump through the necessary hoops, let me know.
