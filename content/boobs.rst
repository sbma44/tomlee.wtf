Not the good kind, though. The kind that run web hosts. Here's what greeted some of you this morning:

|hasweb is unimpressive|

Accidents happen, but this is the third time in two weeks that the same accident has happened. They assure me it won't happen again — but then, they offered the same assurance and the same rationale for why it won't happen again \*last\* time. So apologies in advance for the next failure. Oh: and don't use `HasWeb <http://www.hasweb.com>`__.
