One reason it's been quiet around here this week is that we're kicking off a new, tech-centric blog over at EchoDitto. I haven't quite decided how I'll handle syndicating content from that site back here — I would really like to have the things I write there in my archives.

But until I get that worked out, head over to `labs.echoditto.com <http://labs.echoditto.com>`__ to keep an eye on my geeky output. We're just getting started, but we've already got a few interesting posts up:

- `My thoughts on the incomprehensibility of the OLPC interface <http://labs.echoditto.com/node/9>`__
- `The first installment of JP's LCD-hanging saga <http://labs.echoditto.com/node/5>`__
- `A script I wrote for DCist to create a mobile version of a site from an RSS feed <http://labs.echoditto.com/rss2mobile>`__

Have a look, stay tuned, etc. You can subscribe to the entries feed `here <http://labs.echoditto.com/blog/feed>`__.
