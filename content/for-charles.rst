This graffiti may not seem very remarkable. But in a town where every other beer comes in a pint glass with an Eagles logo on it, and any group of three or more adults can be counted on to eventually disrupt the parade/checkout line/funeral they're attending with a chant of "E-A-G-L-E-S EAGLES!!!", it's kind of noteworthy.

Also, note the stray mark between the N and S in "Redskins". That's presumably the point at which the artist was dragged away from the wall and beaten to death.
