I decided to bike instead of taking the circulator, and as a consequence I got down to the chinatown bus stop a little faster than I had intended. I headed across the street to the Red Roof Inn's hotel bar to get out of the wind. The playlist, during my brief time here:

- Nickelback, I think
- Sheryl Crow
- Definitely Nickelback

I think it's time to head back outside.
