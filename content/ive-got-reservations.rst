|Jones' candy corn soda|\ Thanks to the generosity of my coworker `Matt <http://mstem.wordpress.com>`__, I enjoyed/tolerated a can of Jones' Candy Corn Soda at lunch today. My report: it tastes like candy corn. Sort of. Also like root beer, sort of. And honey-sort-of. But mostly, it tastes like [CLOYINGLY SWEET INDUSTRIAL BYPRODUCT].

Not recommended unless you are a soda company executive hoping for free press attention near a holiday.
