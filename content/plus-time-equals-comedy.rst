From Wired Magazine's June 2007 *Playlist* feature, because the bathroom at work will not be restocked with reading material until Nicco returns to DC in 2008 or the End of Days:

   *Deadwood* fans in our office are still smarting over last year's cancellation of their favorite show. But they won't be able to resist writer David Milch's follow-up series, *John From Cincinnati*, which debuts June 10 on HBO. It's got mystic philosophizing, SoCal surfing, drug addiction, and a mysterious person (or is he an alien?) named John, who is most definitely *not* from Cincinnati. Plus, Rebecca De Mornay plays a smokin' grandma! What's not to like? Whereas *Deadwood* was lavish and profane (think Cormac McCarthy with Tourette's Syndrome), *JFC* is spare and spiritual (think William James with surfboards). But it's pure Milch, so expect another overnight cult hit with memorable taglines ("Meet the fuckin' Jetsons!") and fanboy pilgrimages to Imperial Beach, California, where the series is set.

Scrubbed from the first draft: a bunch of exclamation points and a bit about how our future society will be based upon *John From Cincinnati* and occasionally have to send George Carlin back through time to help David Milch score heroin/bibles.
