The new television has arrived, and it's pretty cool. I'll try not to dwell on this piece of especially conspicuous consumption, since even my gadget-addled brain is still dimly aware that doing so is kind of tacky.

I will note, though, that it's already making me considerably dumb (**UPDATE:** -er! dumb\ *er*! See what I mean?) . Last night I found myself watching an unusually stupid episode of an unusually stupid/successful television show — CSI. This particular episode centered around a semen-wrangling-operation-gone-awry (as they inevitably must) within the glamorous world of professional bullriding. It was immediately apparent that this is the sort of show where "character development" means "having a character grow a beard". Worst of all, I watched it after having voluntarily given up the ability to skip commercials.

And yet! It was so *entrancing*. The CGI bull skeleton? *Magnifique!* And look, you can make out the lettering on the electrical ejaculation stimulator! How could I turn away? Who was I to think I might be able to turn away?

We settled in and ate our delivery pizza without ranch sauce, but it was not for lack of trying.
