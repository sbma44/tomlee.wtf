I haven't written anything here all week, and didn't write much for a while beforehand. That's because I've been putting off writing this post.

Today is my last day at `EchoDitto <http://www.echoditto.com>`__. As you might imagine, it's a bit depressing. Soon I'm going to have to pack up my desk, clean my stuff out of the fridge, and play my last game of foosball as a non-guest. This is, admittedly, all fairly trivial stuff. But I'm the sort of guy who feels wistful about throwing out old CD cases, for god's sake. Change is hard.

Genuinely, objectively awful: the fact that I have to leave my coworkers. I've been incredibly privileged to work with people this kind and smart and funny. I've learned a tremendous amount from them: about business, about running projects, about new technologies, and about leading people. And I've gotten to do it while working with some pretty cool clients: SEIU, Mother Jones and Greenpeace UK all spring to mind; plus I've gotten to contribute, at least peripherally, to efforts on behalf of the Clinton Global Initiative, Seventh Generation and the EFF, among many others.

But it's time to move on — I've felt that way for a little while, to be honest. The sorts of projects you get as a consultant can be a bit homogenous. Billable-hours work can be a drag. And I have to admit: I'm pretty sick of Drupal. I figured that if I was going to keep doing this sort of work, I might go freelance for a bit — even PHP is fun to code when you're in your pajamas. Or maybe I'd wander the earth fighting injustice. I hadn't really decided.

Something came up first, though, and I'm extremely excited about it. As of Monday I'll be working for the `Sunlight Foundation <http://www.sunlightfoundation.com>`__, an organization that I've long admired. I'll be heading up the technical side of their latest project — it's exciting, and daunting, and I can't wait to get started. It'll mean a whole new suite of technologies and challenges; a chance to assemble and lead a team of programmers; and an opportunity to build a tool that — if we do it right — could help people understand some of the ways our government works and how they could be improved. And, importantly, it'll be a chance to learn from a whole new set of brilliant colleagues.

You'll be hearing much more about this from me soon; for now, suffice it to say that I'd love to hear from any talented developers who might be reading (particularly if they know Python) — thomas.j.lee (at) (google's popular email service).

It's going to be strange to leave EchoDitto. `Three years ago I asked for advice about whether I should come work here <http://www.zunta.org/blog/archives/2005/11/23/decisions/>`__. The best advice I got was from Tripp:

   | My experience in the tech world is that after awhile it \*all\* becomes relatively boring. Today's kewl new becomes tommorow's has been. Most of the kewl new is hype and remarketing of the old.
   | So my advice is to focus on the people. How do you feel about the people you currently work with? If you feel good and you think it will stay that way then stick it out.
   | Good people can make boring work fun, and after awhile ALL work becomes boring. I say this after 27 years in the booming computer field.
   | So focus on working with good people.

He was right. Six months later I wrote this (while `shamelessly trawling for hires <http://www.zunta.org/blog/archives/2006/06/02/pimping_actuall/>`__):

   People use the phrase "it was the best decision I ever made" to describe getting a hair transplant, or buying a boat, or ordering a Cobb salad. So I'd like to avoid joining their idiomatic ranks, but I can't. It just seems so obvious. These are the smartest, coolest, funniest, most talented people I've ever worked with, and the job itself is interesting, varied and rewarding. I look forward to work every day. Okay, every non-hungover day.

I'd be lying if I said I was still quite that giddy on a day-to-day basis. Things have settled down, I've gotten older, and the nature of the business — and the internet — has changed. But the part about the people is still true. I've met a lot of amazing folks because of EchoDitto. Thanks to all of you for letting me count you among my friends.
