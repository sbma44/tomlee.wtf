Go read `Dave's review <http://dcist.com/2008/11/12/mates_of_state_black_cat.php>`__, which is both smarter and more measured that I ever could have managed — I'm just so goddamn in the tank for this band.

In particular, Dave's point about the new material is well-taken. After the precision pop machinery of *Bring It Back*, the new album left me disappointed. But live — faced with singing, emoting human beings — the relatively nuanced piano compositions of *Re-arrange Us* are ultimately more gratifying, if less immediately, dizzyingly dopamine-pumping\ :sup:`1`. Dave's absolutely right when he says that this is a band that's still getting better.

Which isn't to say that they aren't already really good. This was the first time I've managed to see MoS, and I was surprised by how closely the live arrangements matched those on their records — I'd just sort of assumed that the magic of overdubs played a big role in the albums' appeal. Not so. Their high-register stuff doesn't hit as reliably as it does on the records, but then you wouldn't expect it to. In general their records seem to be a fair representation of the noises they make live.

One thing Dave said that I will quibble with: I really liked their version of "Something". Sure, it sounded out of place in the set. But in a good way — it sounded casual. I may be wrong — maybe they've toiled over that cover — but the impression conveyed was that you could take pretty much any classic song, feed it into the MoS machine and have it come out harmonized and singable and keyboarded-up. It makes you think that everything they touch turns to pop (not to say the Beatles aren't pop, but you know what I mean). It allowed me separate their sound from their songwriting, which made their musicianship seem all the more impressive.

But like I said, you shouldn't listen to me: I'm just a hopeless fanboy.

:sup:`1`\ To be fair, the poppier numbers weren't helped by the fact that the sound at the Cat, while perfectly good and perfectly audible, was turned down to a relatively humane level — comfortable, sure, but there really should've been no escape from that keyboard tone.
