It's slightly ridiculous, but I have to confess that I've only recently discovered `Hype Machine <http://hype.non-standard.net>`__. I've been aware of its existence for a while, but my previous attempts to use it always met with failure. The flash player didn't work right on my old laptop, and the HM iTunes link never has and still doesn't work properly for me. With those functions unavailable, I didn't see a compelling-enough reason to use the site.

But, spurred by references to it in an Unfogged thread, I gave it another shot, got the flash player to work, and found out that it's unbelievably great. There's one major downside, though: I seem to run into buffering problems with the player on a pretty regular basis. This is an infuriating way to listen to music, and particularly bad when I try to use the app through the Wii web browser (the console is hooked up to my stereo, after all — in theory, this could make for a great at-home radio station).

The HM flash player uses the open-source `XSPF Music Player <http://musicplayer.sourceforge.net/>`__, so I'm optimistic that I'll be able to crack it open and implement some more stringent buffering. Unfortunately, my initial explorations revealed that the site uses some irritating redirects and is going to require me to do stupid things like fake my HTTP referer and user agent string. I realize that's gibberish to many of you, but trust me when I say that it's totally lame.

So it may be a little while before I really get my hands dirty with this project. In the meantime, I can't resist posting these two tracks, both of which I'm a little obsessed with (the latter despite not really liking CYHSY):
