I'm `also <http://dcist.com/2008/07/17/goodspeed_to_boston.php>`__ sorry to `see Rob and Libby go <http://goodspeedupdate.com/2008/2238>`__. Not only because they're great people who I already don't see often enough, but also because this means Bostonians will suddenly get to learn fascinating new things about their city as Rob discovers, researches and writes them up — a luxury that I've grown accustomed to having for myself over the past few years.

If there's solace to be had, it's that Rob's membership in this city's secret transit cabal seems unlikely to be affected. So take heart, and if you're feeling wistful, go reread my `all-time favorite Goodspeed Update entry <http://goodspeedupdate.com/2007/2125>`__.
