Walking into the Old Dominion Brewhouse yesterday, two guys stopped me and asked if I could direct them to `The Space <http://www.manifestdensity.net/2007/07/17/membership_has_its_privileges/>`__. Clearly I have no idea what the market actually wants.

In other news, I'm interested to hear if there's a section on La/te Ni/ght Sh/ots where users can employ any HTML — links, images, whatever. If you've used the site enough to notice such a spot, let me know. Science projects are hatching.
