My friend & coworker Phil has started `a Facebook group <http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2376417082>`__ about the `DMCA abuse du jour <http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/05/08/1922210>`__. I'm trying to get through this life without joining any Facebook groups, but if you care about this sort of of thing and have already succumbed, you should go round out Phil's numbers.
