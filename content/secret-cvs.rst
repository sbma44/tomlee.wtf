I was at Cafe Cozy Corner yesterday morning, which is part of a Brigadoon-like complex of businesses that seems to have erupted at 10th and L over the weekend. Most notable among them is an almost completely deserted CVS — I'm pretty excited at the prospect of having a drug store a mere four blocks from my house. It's true that it won't stock anything that Giant doesn't, but it's also true that checking out at Giant always involves at least twenty minutes of standing in line.

But the coffeeshop isn't as impressive as the CVS. It does have a lot of fantastically weird packaged foods — Pokky, dried tofu, and triangular rye crackers, among other things — but the clientele seems to consist of hungover not-actually-blonde girls in sweatpants and their lunkhead boyfriends (actual overheard conversation topic: Facebook). And, although Yglesias maintains that my goy status disqualifies me from opining on bagels, these chewy abominations were even worse than the watery coffee that accompanied them. Topping things off, the only wifi to be had was an incredibly slow link stolen from a nearby apartment.

So: CVS thumbs up, coffee shop thumbs down. But the latter's problems aren't anything that a new chef, a wifi link, and a serious botulism outbreak couldn't fix.
