| As far as I can recall, there is no candy bar on the national market that contains raisins. None of even moderate prominence, anyway. The closest you can come is Nestle's generally-underrated `Chunky <http://www.cybercandy.co.uk/search/index1.php/url_indprod/xdbc_2>`__ product, but its length:(width+height) ratio is all off — it's some sort of ill-conceived candy chimera. Deliciousness aside, it's clearly not fit to take its place in the American pantheon of bar-shaped food products.
| Now, I'm not noting this to argue for raisins as a primary candy bar component — I know that proposition would be controversial. Still, you have to admit that raisins are a classic confection ingredient; a solid, dependable utility player. Yet the candy bar industry systematically ignores them. Meanwhile, various other ingredients — the poorly-defined "nougat" in particular — seem to me to be consistently over-represented. I don't know exactly what's going on, but it's virtually guaranteed to be sinister.
