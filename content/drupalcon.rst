I've added a badge for `Drupalcon <http://dc2009.drupalcon.org/?ref=default>`__ over there on the right sidebar, in an utterly shameless effort to `get a free ticket <http://dc2009.drupalcon.org/swag>`__. It's pretty pathetic; I should really just buy one. Thing is, when they first went on sale I thought I'd be going on the strength of EchoDitto's allotment of sponsor tickets. These days I don't use Drupal on a day to day basis, and it would be hard for me to justify attending the convention for more than a panel or two — not when I could be working. Given that, even though the organizers (`hi guys <http://developmentseed.org/>`__!) have done a great job of keeping the price down, $250 is a bit steep for a couple of hours' instruction in technologies that aren't immediately useful to me.

Hence the swathing in swag. One way or another I'll be participating in the festivities — so far as I know, convention badges won't be required for hanging out at bars at the end of each day. But I'm not sure I'll actually be at the panels.
