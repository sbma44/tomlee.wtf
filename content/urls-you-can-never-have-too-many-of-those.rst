- `Erase the line between your bookmarks and del.icio.us <http://del.icio.us/help/firefox/bookmarks/quicktour>`__. Via Techcrunch.
- `This t-shirt is pretty awesome <http://geekz.co.uk/shop/store/show/schneier-tshirt>`__. `Also <http://geekz.co.uk/schneierfacts/>`__.
- `Bruce and Craig Finn <http://www.stereogum.com/archives/005029.html>`__. Charles `tracked down <http://dccharles.blogspot.com/2007/04/comin-to-liberate-you.html>`__ the video, but it ain't great. Still, despite the video it's clear that this must have been an amazing thing to see. I guess this really is going to be the year of Springsteen. Sorry, Mr. Byrne. It was a nice renaissance you had going there.
- Lego bumper cars, using the power of MAGNETS. Originally from `here <http://news.lugnet.com/town/?n=9657>`__ via `here <http://dansdata.blogsome.com/2007/04/07/recent-lego-developments/>`__. It's pretty goddamn clever.

- Also from Techcrunch: remember that Coop social networking extension for Firefox that I was excited about? Well, there's an early version `available <http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/04/05/early-prototype-of-firefox-coop-released/>`__. Unfortunately, in a cruelly ironic twist the only service it currently supports is Facebook. (Sidenote: if I was a twelve year old British boy with the same general opinions about technology, would I begin calling it Fæcesbook? Yes. Yes, I probably would.)
- Finally, Google's new "My Maps" functionality `seems pretty neat <http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl=en&z=4&ll=46.55886,-93.164062&spn=34.113248,85.078125&om=1&msid=117070561667971774162.00000111c919493a28bd8&msa=0>`__. But reading about it, I'm even more intrigued to see that the GMaps API can now consume GeoRSS — I'd missed that announcement. The DC government publishes a number of RSS feeds with geographic information in them; Yahoo Pipes can also speak GeoRSS. It's getting awfully easy to build mashups.
