Potbelly, 2:30ish. I'm standing in line, having just ordered a delicious turkey-on-wheat, when I spotted an older gentleman in line behind me. He was wearing a pinstripe suit, a blue shirt with a white collar, and a yellow tie. His gray hair was gelled into a short, relatively tasteful euromullet. And he was carrying *not only* a copy of "Who's Who In Real Estate" — surely one of the most vacuous possible incarnations of a shamelessly vacuous line of scam-books — but also what I can only call a scepter. I guess it could've served as a cane, but the black shaft looked a little insubstantial. And the brass head was spherical in a distinctly uncanelike way. Also, he wasn't using it to walk — it was just tucked into the crook of his arm along with the book.

I don't really know what else to say about him. Have you ever seen somebody and instantly known that they were the X-iest example of X that you've ever seen, but still been unable to solve for X? I don't know what sort of world he'd just come from, but I've got a feeling I should be grateful that it only intersects with my own in sandwich shops.
