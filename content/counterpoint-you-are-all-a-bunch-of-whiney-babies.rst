Snow is great! `Amanda is crazy <http://blogstretch.blogspot.com/2010/02/it-is-still-snowing.html>`__! Working from home is nice! And yes, I'm kind of sick of reading, and okay, I ate sardine tacos for lunch, and no, I have no idea what I would do if my power went out (but it's okay because THAT WILL NEVER HAPPEN).

But I still love the snow.  It reminds me of that one big storm during my childhood, when a layer of snow was packed down to icy horribleness, then another foot was deposited on top, then a eighth-inch crust of freezing crust topped things off.  That certainly gave the plows problems -- I got the whole week off school.  Almost as good, it was just strong enough to support my form, when that form was properly enveloped in a puffy coat and on its stomach and sliding down the sleepy-streets-turned-gentle-hills of the neighborhood between my house and my friend Rob's.  If you timed it, this turned out to not be such an efficient means of locomotion.  At the time, though, it was the fastest, most thrilling way I'd ever moved across that space.

This storm seems likely to involve a bit less ecstatic ad-hoc sledding and a bit more disgusting slush and missing Taylor sandwich ingredients.  Childhood in the suburbs has a commanding lead over adulthood in the city when it comes to winter wonderment.  But I'm still thrilled to see icicles on my neighbors' gutters, and drifts accumulating in the corners of the alley below. C'mon, guys: *snow day*. Those words are going to thrill me until the day I die.
