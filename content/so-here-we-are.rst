| |a typical British scene|\ Despite a valiant attempt to forget my passport, I currently appear to be in London. I can tell because the Starbucks I'm sitting in is trying to sell me "crisps". If not for that, I'd probably have no idea. Jetlag is in full effect, and the last thing I ate was a microwaved airline croissant that I probably shouldn't have.
| I'm over here for the training portion of our contract with Gre/enpe/ace UK. And while I recognize that it's pretty boorish to complain about free transatlantic travel, I'm going to do so anyway. Perhaps this trip will be better, but the last one consisted of a bunch of 14+ hour days and one of the worst periods in my personal life that I can remember. By the end of it the near-inevitability of getting creamed by a left-bearing automobile seemed like something to be embraced.
| But I'll try to rouse myself. The beer's awfully good, and the folks we're meeting with are smart and fun. Once I've gotten some more sleep and internet I should cheer up pretty quickly.
