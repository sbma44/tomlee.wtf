And you should come see him play. Tonight! Velvet Lounge! 9pmish! More details (and music) `here <http://thecityveins.com/blog/2007/04/11/tonight/>`__. I'll see you there.

As for me, I'm rushing to meet a deadline for all of that similarity matrix stuff I was working on earlier. I've had to trade a little scholarly rigor for visual flair, but it's looking like I'll definitely have a visualization to show. And I'm pretty confident that this'll be the most analytically-rich entry of the `contest <www.sunlightfoundation.com/mashup>`__.

On the other hand, I'm even more confident that I'll lose to somebody who spent two hours writing a script to, say, Twitter geocoded YouTube clips of legislators' gaffes to constituents' Zunes. Or something. But that's the nature of the beast, and I still had fun tackling this project.
