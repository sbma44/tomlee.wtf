...now that Charles is gone. He's spending the week celebrating `Darren <http://www.darrenhiggins.com/>`__ and Emilie's love over in Belgium, a country about which I know disappointingly few hilarious stereotypes. The happy couple is getting married in a castle, and apparently Charles has been drafted into the ceremony. I believe he'll be operating the portcullis.

His departure has left the house with too few people and too many options: I can't decide what to make filthy first. Last night's unexpected bout of burrito-making caprice left some promising food spills around the kitchen, but I ultimately decided that was an unambitious way to begin and cleaned them up. For now I've settled for leaving a pile of sweaty gym clothes on the couch — but this is merely the foundation for the work to come.
