In comments, `Ben <http://waste.typepad.com>`__ suggests `August Heat <http://www.donaldtyson.com/august.html>`__ as a good scary story. I'm glad he did — it's excellent (and a very quick read). Go have a look.

Only four story-writing days left! Hopefully you all aren't as desperately behind as I am.
