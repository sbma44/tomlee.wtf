`Some <http://www.manifestdensity.net/2007/09/10/asdfr111/#comment-12993>`__ `questions <http://pygmalioninablanket.blogspot.com/2007/09/131.html>`__ have been raised about my and `Amanda's <http://blogstretch.blogspot.com/2007/09/zomg.html>`__ recent *Iron Man* advocacy. Allow me to offer a slightly more nuanced case `than I did last night <http://www.manifestdensity.net/2007/09/10/asdfr111/>`__:

#. First, as the Nabob points out, there's the Robert Downey Jr. factor. Consider the recent awesomeness of comic book movies. Now consider that the title of Greatest Living Superhero Actor is currently held by either Wesley Snipes or Christopher Reeve, depending on your personal taste and how carefully you read the criteria for winning the aforementioned title.
   Robert Downey Jr. has the sort of genuine charisma that can only be learned by having to repeatedly explain to strangers why they just found you sleeping in their house. It comes through in his performances. In the preview his delivery of the script's lame jokes actually makes them seem sort of funny! Ask yourself: what if Sir Laurence Olivier had been cast in a role involving repulsor beams? What would cinema look like today? My guess: explodier.
#. Although I didn't think it was as great as `certain other people <http://www.movering.com>`__ did, *Transformers* did usher in a major new cinematic innovation: the "how does the protagonist fare against U.S. military hardware?" scene. It should soon take its place next to "mistaken identity", "*Rocky*-style training montage", "going on two dates at once", and the two or three other dramatic conventions that screenwriters have at their disposal. In the preview, Iron Man, like, totally dusts some fighter jets, and you can tell the pilots are all "Maaan" but also have to admit that it was pretty sweet. I agree with those pilots, but my enthusiasm is unchecked by professional considerations.
#. Finally, the preview implies that the movie retells the Iron Man origin story more or less faithfully. Even though Iron Man is a second-string superhero, most nerds are well-acquainted with and attached to his origin story. This is because all subsequent Iron Man stories have kind of sucked, prompting the creators to revisit the origin story on a regular basis.
   I don't think that deviation from the canon would have much of an effect on my enjoyment of the movie. But hearing nerds whine about it for the next eight months *would* have an effect on my enjoyment of the internet. So thanks in advance for sticking to the source text, Mr. Favreau.
