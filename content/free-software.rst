Tim Lee has written `the best primer on the history and philosophical basis of free software that I've yet read <http://timothyblee.com/?p=1362>`__.  It's definitely worth a look, even for those who know the basic contours of this stuff.

The comparisons between this particular movement and purely political movements can be extended further than you might think -- right down to some of the same issues that `Kerry <http://reason.com/archives/2009/10/20/are-property-rights-enough>`__ and `Tim <http://timothyblee.com/?p=1360>`__ have been discussing this week in an entirely different context, where the removal of licenses/laws isn't enough to address for the pernicious effects of less clearly-defined norms and dynamics.  It's also been an important part of my ideological education: watching the continued success of free software despite the `seemingly pathological dysfunction of many of its contributors <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flame_war>`__ has gone a long way toward convincing me that our society isn't (necessarily) doomed.
