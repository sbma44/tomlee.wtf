I do several things:

**Government affairs**. Competition policy, map certifications.

**Privacy.** Explaining our practices to big customers. Evaluating new product ideas for their privacy impact, and looking for opportunities to improve it. Working with privacy counsel to understand new rules--from governments, app stores, corporate policies--and ensure our approach is aligned with them. Looking for ways to improve our systems, both to strengthen the protections we can offer and to make it easier for our business to benefit from insights generated by our audience.

**OpenStreetMap**. I am on the LWG and serve as Mapbox's LWG-whisperer. When we want to use open data in a new way, I help to construct the guardrails that ensure we will meet our obligations without endangering our business's competitiveness. I manage relationships with the community and do my best to ensure Mapbox is considered a good citizen within it.

**Reactive comms**. Sometimes called "crisis comms", though we haven't had one of those in a while. I'm generally the first line in fielding press inquiries from major outlets, recommending a strategy for responding and, where appropriate, serving as our spokesperson. I maintain relationships with journalists and sometimes help them find angles into our work and concerns.

**Lots of other stuff!** Helping ward off patent trolls by digging into their claims. Identifying our own patentable inventions. Working with expert counsel to understand export policy changes and align our business with them. Negotiating print and video rights requests with our web of in-licenses. Performing data analysis to understand how our services are being used by strategically important accounts. Writing market research memos about business opportunities the company is considering investing in.
