`Bunnie Huang <http://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/>`__ is the man who cracked the Xbox — not once but twice, as he recently revealed himself to be involved with the hypervisor escalation exploit, too. He's an electronics god.

Recently he's been working on `Chumby <http://www.chumby.com/>`__, a fun alarm clockish gadget that promises to bring widget-like capabilities to your bedside table. Part of his duties involve arranging and overseeing the production of the units in China.

He's just begun putting up a series of blog posts about his trip, and they're really fascinating. At the very least, be sure to check out the first one, which has video showcasing the incredible skill and speed of the workers.

**UPDATE:** I see that BoingBoing linked to these posts, too, and Bunnie's put up a notice saying his site may be inaccessible as a result. Whoops.

**UPDATE 2:** Aaaand after further RSS catching-up, I see that son1 `beat me to this <http://bayes.wordpress.com/2007/07/13/potemkin-factories-crazy-story/>`__ by a mile. Sorry for the redundancy! But hey, everyone agrees: these posts are worth reading.
