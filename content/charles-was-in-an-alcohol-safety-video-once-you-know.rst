Megan has an `excellent suggestion <http://meganmcardle.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/08/the_age_of_responsibility.php>`__ for reducing drunk driving: put a note on convicted offenders' licenses that makes it illegal for bartenders to serve them. It makes a hell of a lot more sense than `installing breathalyzers in steering columns <http://www.alcoholalert.com/car-breathalyzer.html>`__. Cheaper, too.
