It went fine! The panel was located inconveniently in spacetime (far from downtown/first thing in the morning) and the room was huuuge (Texas, etc.) but we still managed to draw forty people, which I'll count as a win.  Also, I'm pretty sure I didn't say anything that's going to get me fired, which is the only real criterion I use to judge these things.

Apropos of nothing, during preparation for the panel I discovered that the Census TIGER/LINE GIS dataset has a logo, and it's totally awesome:

I feel like an embroidered Gosling/Drive jacket with this logo would get you a lot of action at the geoDC meetup.
