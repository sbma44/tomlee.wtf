Not once in `this article <http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/03/16/AR2010031603842.html>`__ does anyone mention how comfortable the planetarium's seats are. As a Washington-Lee alumnus who attended class mere steps from the planetarium and who had to wake up *really early* in order to take both Calculus and Awful Literary Magazine, I would like to see this included in administrators' considerations.  Planetarium Visit Day was a tremendous boon to both my physical and psychological well-being (though admittedly I learned shit-all about stars).
