Wow. Friday night was incredibly impressive. `Josh <http://www.badmintonstamps.com/>`__, `Emily <http://www.movering.com>`__ and Lee decided to throw a party at a bowling alley in the basement of a church community center. They acquired large amounts of beer, pretzels and DJs, were written up on some Philly blogs, and had a ton of people show up to bowl, drink and have a great time. There's a less-biased writeup `here <http://ohmurderinc.blogspot.com/2007/05/ok-here-i-go.html>`__ (some photos, too).

I don't know if it's just a lingering effect of my Big Lebowski ascii art project, but it seems that I really enjoy taking photos of silhouetted figures bowling. So, uh, sorry about that. I think `this photo <http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbma44/498341048/in/set-72157600214964628/>`__ makes up for it, though.
