Bettween my affection for the Fang Island and Ratatat albums I've been feeling a little abashed about my recent enthusiasm for lyric-free albums.  Is it over for me?  Am I entering my (perhaps overdue) indie rock senescence?

Well, maybe.  But either way, allow me to indulge my narcissistic archival impulse for one sentence more. It only takes three albums to sum things up: `one <http://www.amazon.com/Meadowlands-Wrens/dp/B0000CBLAY/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=music&qid=1280552608&sr=1-1>`__, `two <http://www.amazon.com/Will-Hair-When-Were-Gone/dp/B0000DJEMK/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=music&qid=1280552639&sr=1-1>`__, `three <http://www.amazon.com/Funeral-Arcade-Fire/dp/B0002IVN9W/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=music&qid=1280552585&sr=8-1>`__.  There, all done.
