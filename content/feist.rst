This version of "I Feel It All" from `an appearance on KCRW <http://www.kcrw.com/music/programs/mb/mb070510feist>`__ isn't all that different from the album version, yet somehow manages to be significantly better. But then, I always think that when someone picks up a song's tempo slightly relative to its studio version. This version sounds a little more raw, reverbed and bassy, too, probably due to how it was recorded. In short, it fools me in all kinds of obvious but enjoyable ways. My deterministic nervous system gives it a predictable thumbs up.
